7.0,"Still fast, still furious","Fast and Furious, or 4 Fast 4 Furious if you're keeping count, is a movie you can basically sum up in one sentence. Muscle guys, muscle cars, hot chicks, and incredible action sequences. Not much has changed in the four films other than who the muscle guys wind up being played by but nonetheless, if you're going to the movies strictly to continually watch these things, then not only will this series run forever, but you should have no problem sitting through this fourth flick. Of course the other thing to look at here is the resurrection of Vin Diesel's action star persona, and considering he's been doing movies like ‘Babylon AD’ and ‘The Pacifier’ for the past couple years, you can basically say this is one of his better performances in a real long time. The plot is pretty thin but I'm sure for fans of the first movie it will be nice to see the two leads back playing their roles. Diesel reprises wanted felon Dom Toretto, who after escaping at the end of the first movie seems to have started a new life in the Dominican Republic knocking over trucks. What brings him back to Los Angeles is revenge for the death of his girlfriend (Michelle Rodriguez) at the hands of brutal drug dealers led by Braga. This brings him face to face with the man who infiltrated his gang in the first flick, Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), now an FBI agent going after the same drug dealers. And wouldn't you know that driving plays a big part in Braga's whole smuggling operation so both Brian and Dom team up, amidst some trust issues, to bring down the drug cartel. Hopefully director Justin Lin (‘Tokyo Drift’) gets the credit he deserves this time around. He's fantastic with these action sequences, not only making them pulse-pounding thrill rides but also letting you feel like you're in the car with these characters. The movie starts out brilliantly with a propane truck hi-jacking that turns life or death when things get out of control and the truck barrels down on the hi-jackers, and then just continues to go full throttle, staging a race on a crowded Los Angeles street and then chases in an underground tunnel shaft. Once these characters get in their cars you won't be bored for a moment. Outside the car is a different matter though. Both actors do what they can. Diesel is adrenaline personified. With his gravelly voice, bulging biceps, and cool, playful way around a line of dialogue, he's a lot of fun to watch. And while still pretty wooden, I admit that Walker has a pretty-boy face and an athletic physicality that makes him a good hero. This pairing worked well in the first movie, sort of like an amateur, yet entertaining, version of the adrenaline-seeking- cop and criminal formula a la ‘Point Break.’ Just after four movies it's all gotten stale and it's easy to see that the cars are the real stars here. The Dom-Brian conflict and Dom's vendetta against the cartel is mostly overshadowed and there isn't much for either character to do when away from their vehicles. Diesel and Walker try but they always seem to be a couple wheels short of competing with the four-wheel drive. ‘Fast and Furious’ deserves credit for doing the key things well. If your expecting much from anything other than the cars then it's a disappointment, but thanks to Justin Lin this has all the makings of a really thrilling action movie, making this fourth flick in the series a little bit better than its predecessors and a lot of fun.",C-Younkin,2009-03-31,2009
7.0,The Family is back and the franchise is Saved!,"Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) have escaped to the Dominican Republic and resume their criminal ways. However when the cops close in on Dom, he decides to leave everything behind including Letty. Later he finds that Letty has been killed while working for drug baron Braga who is using street racers to drive his drugs across the border. Only he doesn't know that Letty was working for Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) as an informant. Now Dom and Brian are both trying to get Braga by infiltrating his group as drivers.The family is back and the movie is so much the better for it. Director Justin Lin returns after Tokyo Drift. The franchise really missed the presence of Vin Diesel. The only minor disappointment are the car chases. They're good but just not great. They can be better. It's also sad to lose Letty so early on in the movie. It misses her energy.",SnoopyStyle,2014-02-23,2014
7.0,Great Adventure,"When Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is informed that his beloved Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) was assassinated, he returns to Los Angeles to find the murderer. Meanwhile, his former friend and FBI agent Brian Conner (Paul Walker) is assigned to capture the mysterious drug lord Braga that is looking for replacement drivers, working undercover as his courier, driving from Mexico to USA through the desert. Dom discovers that Letty was working as a courier for Braga when she was killed and he decides to join his gang to find the killer. Their lives entwine substantiating their friendship and Brian dates Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) again. But they need to find the true identity of Braga. ""Fast & Furious"" is a great adventure and an excellent entertainment as good as the first movie of this franchise. The chemistry between Paul Walker and Vin Diesel is amazing performing very likable characters. The talented Jordana Brewster is for me one of the most (if not the most) gorgeous actresses of her generation and I look forward to see her works. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Velozes e Furiosos 4"" (""Fast and Furious 4"")",claudio_carvalho,2009-12-12,2009
7.0,It's nice to have you back,"I loved ‘The Fast and The Furious.’ Cars, ladies, cheesy lines and acting, crazy action = a groovy mix! Fast forward a few years and we finally have ‘Fast & Furious’- the first true sequel! So much nostalgia! Seeing Vin, Paul, Michelle, and Jordana together again was fantastic! You can tell that these characters have grown since the first film. Brian is working on a case with the FBI that brings him in collision with Dom, who is back in the states seeking revenge for the murder of his gal Letty. This entry is definitely a bit heavy compared to the first few but that doesn't mean there isn't fun to be had! The opening sequence and the race at the middle of the film are two highlights! The tunnel sequences were not as good though, CGI being one of the reasons- still enjoyed it though! The F&F franchise isn't really known for stellar acting or writing or even realistic action sequences so it's no surprise that this sequel plays the same way. I think that's part of the charm of these movies, at least for me. Don Omar and Tego were hilarious, John Ortiz was good as the villain though not at all threatening, Fenix was just asking to get owned by that car in the end (what a way to go), and seeing Han from Tokyo Drift was a nice little treat. I had hoped we would see more of Gisele and we do in the sequels! That's a good thing! ‘Fast & Furious’ is a fun, dramatic, action-packed continuation of the franchise with some nice nods to the original that fans will appreciate. The ending got me so pumped for the next one!",joshrortiz,2013-05-27,2013
7.0,The best of the series by a mile,"I just got back from the midnight screening of 'Fast & Furious' and I have to admit the movie very much exceeded my fairly low expectations for the film. While the original film was entertaining, it was never a good movie by any means. Let's not even get started on the two that followed. The fourth installment however, is another story. Most of the original cast has come back and seeing them back in action together really makes you realize the F&F franchise isn't the same without them. The chemistry between the three leads (Diesel, Walker and Brewster) is the strongest it's been yet, and I would dare to call several of the scenes 'moving' as a result. Who would have ever expected that from Fast & Furious. The movie does an excellent job of keeping you on the edge of your seat, there's no shortage of action and a story that keeps your attention. The movie starts out in the DR with Vin Diesel pulling off a fairly implausible heist of hijacking a fuel tanker with his new crew. Minutes later, we learn of Letty's murder which in turn basically sets the tone for the rest of the movie as Diesel sets off on an all out rampage to even the score. Like the previous three, you certainly need to suspend your disbelief for the duration of the movie, however I was glad to see they didn't go overboard and kept the special effects and CIG to what seemed like a happy minimum. Anyone who's ever been a fan of the Fast and the Furious series will absolutely need to go see this on the big screen. Even if you weren't so hot for the originals, the movie is still worth a look. In my opinion it's acting, story, plot, special effects are the best of the series so far and almost makes it stand out as a respectable movie. Better yet, they've left the door wide open for 'Fast & Furious 5'. To be continued...",phatrick88,2009-04-03,2009
7.0,"Original cast, different story","After two films that strayed away from the very first that made the franchise popular, producers to The Fast and the Furious (2001) decided to finally bring back the original cast and big name stars. That was one of their best decisions that have been made. It's baffling to why they thought changing the cast would really benefit them in any way. All it does is create resent and a disconnect with the new characters. Fans don't appreciate that. However, this is not the only difference brought to this ongoing series. The original cast returns but the story changes. Oh yes, there's still an abundance racing cars but it's for a different reason.The story reunites Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) again to help in the arrest of a Cartel who is secretly making drug shipments in and out of the border of Mexico. However, these events only happen under very coincidental circumstances. The writer behind this installment is Chris Morgan, the same man behind The Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006). Morgan's writing is articulated in a way that still incorporates racing but it's no longer about who's packing nitro next to their driver's seat anymore. That part, fans should enjoy and this is really its strongest element. However, what Morgan still can't accomplish is a narrative that is cohesive enough that makes sense in its continuity. Just why exactly was Tokyo Drift (2006) made if they planned on making a prequel to it 3 years later?Also, the character of Brian O'Conner is getting a tad redundant. He still lies and he drops the FBI after 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003), but now is working for the FBI of L.A. And this would be fine and all if he would stop being such a rule breaker. O'Conner just can't seem to follow the rules he swore to uphold. Why doesn't he just stop working for the FBI - it doesn't benefit him. Thankfully, O'Conner no longer has a love interest problem. He's stuck with Mia and that's it. Character wise, there aren't much of any new appearances except for the antagonists. Toretto is back along with his girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodgriguez) and sister Mia (Jordana Brewster). The only character that makes a subtle change is Paul Walker at which most girls will think he's the next heartthrob. Instead of having wavy surfer hair and wearing casual clothing, he now has a tux and a straight crew cut. Yeah, I could see why.The action is still fierce too. Instead of collaborating frequently on the town alleyways, the driving sequences also expand to broader horizons with larger landscapes and less tar. It'll give the audience something new to look at instead of the neon high beams and flashing traffic lights. The special effects also conform well to their surroundings; nothing looks out of place. Lastly, the franchise has finally found a solid contender to compose a score and that is Brian Tyler. During some very sentimental scenes, Tyler is able to emphasize those moments with the right emotion. Yet, Tyler is still lacking a distinctive theme for this franchise, which is a shame. He is an accomplished composer. Overall, a better sequel than the last two.With the original cast back and a story that involves more than just fast cars, this installment starts to resurrect what it had going for it from the start. Its continuity nonetheless is a totally different issue that still needs addressing.",breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,2014-05-26,2014
7.0,fourth in the series,"i thought this prequel to Tokyo Drift was actually not bad.it starts off with a real adrenaline rush.the racing scenes are pretty good,as are the chase scenes.the story was good,and flowed well.there are quite a few dramatic moments in this film and they all work well.most of the original actors form the first film in the series are back,including Vin Diesel,Jordana Brewster Michele Rodriguez,and Paul Walker.i don't think it was as good as the first film,but it was a close second.i added it to my collection,and don't regret it.if you're a fan of the series,you should like this one.for me,Fast & Furious is a well deserved 7/10",disdressed12,2011-04-24,2011
9.0,Awesome Action fourth installment. Fast & Furious is tremendous!,"Fast & Furious (2009) is an awesome Action packed sequel, where The Fast and the Furious (2001) stopped. This is the real sequel to The Fast and The Furious. I love that Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster reprise their roles back to the roots the way they were. This is my fourth favorite best film in the series, this film Is a seat to the edge from the beginning till the end. This movie kept me thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. Sure it's a little far fetched, but who cares? It's a movie, and definitely not as bad as some people are saying. Besides, the point of watching a movie is to escape reality so I don't understand why people complain when movies are not realistic. Provided a cinematic equivalent of NOS to the franchise with a tone shift that helped make it one of the most popular and profitable action series in the last decade. Excellent flick. Much better than the middle two. Just forget those movies happened. This was good balls to the walls action with much better actors with the original 4 back together. Bad idea making 2 and 3 :) Vin Diesel and Paul Walker re team with Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster for the ultimate chapter of the franchise built on speed! When fugitive Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) returns to Los Angeles to avenge a loved one's death, it reignites his feud with agent Brian O'Conner (Walker). But, as they race through crowded city streets and across international lines, they must test their loyalties by joining together to bring down a shared enemy. From big rig heists to precision tunnel crawls, Fast & Furious takes you back into the high-octane world, which lives for speed, drives for the rush and breaks all the rules!""Maybe you're the bad guy pretending to be the good guy."" This film is more about stopping a notorious drug lord Arturo Braga and avenging the murder of Letty (Michelle Rodriguez). This film is set back in Los Angles when everything started, after 5.years of leaving the city of Angeles for Dominican Republic after Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew become a Wanted Fugitives. Letty was murdered when she was mixed up in a drug racers mule cartel. She knew the people who hired her, will double crossed her, while trying to escape the flying bullets she was killed by a drug lord's henchman. That weary angrier Dom (Vin Diesel) brings him back to Los Angeles, to avenge his loved one's death and tracking down Drug Lord Braga and killing him. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), is now an FBI agent, and he is assigned to track down a notorious drug lord named Arturo Braga. Both men faces each other in a final showdown. Braga is looking for a fast drivers that are driving and smuggling trough desert New Mexico drugs. Brian goes again undercover only to find out that he and Dom (Vin Diesel) are been double crossed and set up on the same way that was Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) was. This film is filled with full action, fast cars, full of stunts and beautiful women. Gal Gadot is tremendous as Gisele Harabo it was her first role in this film and she was awesome, she acted the character terrific. Paul walker was the best in this film, finally, finally they did something with the character, he become an FBI Agent which I love that with the character In this movie. I love that Dom (Vin Diesel) at the end of the film didn't run, he surrender and I love how Brian ( Paul Walker) was testifying for him in the court. Seriously this film Kicks ass, although I prefer Fast Five over this Action Flick, but that doesn't mean this film did not do the job right, it did! And this film is highly underrated and criticized by critics. Also Han (Sung Kang) has a small scene in the beginning of this film, that was before they killed the beloved character in The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006). The rating I am giving to this film is 9. Anything below 7 would be ridiculous, if anyone would not say that this wasn't At least A GOOD ACTION FILM! (it is sure as hell better than all the comic movies that are getting high scores.)",ivo-cobra8,2015-10-18,2015
7.0,Crank Up The Testosterone,"This is one of these 107-minute testosterone movies guys crave every once in awhile, some more than others. Being a somewhat-old guy, I don't look as these as often anymore but every once in awhile it's fun to kick back and just watch fast cars, loose women, wild action and fairly-brainless film.There isn't much of a plot but my guess is people who are fans of this film series don't care. Just give us the above - muscle cars, macho men, sexy babes and a few great chase scenes - and that's all that is asked. I thought the best scene was the first one, a chase down mountain in the Dominican Republic. That was like a James Bond opening scene: a real attention-getter.After that, you get the normal F&F material, which glamorizes things that shouldn't be (racing through crowded streets, etc.) but also has the ""good"" guys going to capture a drug lord from Mexico.....and a lot of punks along the way. They all sneer and have a lot of tattoos. I've only seen this one and the first in the series but from what I read here, I've seen the two best of the four Fast & Furious films. Vin Diesel helps make them a notch above the others, I suspect. He's always interesting as ""Dom Toretto"" and his character is the most credible.",ccthemovieman-1,2009-08-19,2009
1.0,Annoying camera shake...,"Every time there is a fight scene, car chase or action sequence the camera shakes around all over the place and you can't see what's happening. What's the point of that? I gave up trying to watch it because I got a damn headache... Grrr",phil-932-237806,2019-05-11,2019
9.0,Great movie.,"Fast and Furious was a very good movie that had a darker and more serious tone than any of the prior films in the franchise. I loved seeing almost the entire original cast return and the amazing cars and impressive special effects that are a staple of the series return once again... granted, with a reduced emphasis on the cars themselves. The only real problem I had was that the continuity was broken a bit. *SPOILERS* Why, for example, is Paul Walker back in LA after the ending of 2 Fast 2 Furious? What happened to Tyrese's character? What happened to the rest of the crew from the original movie? These are not huge complaints but they did take away from the experience a bit. It's also evident that this film is a prequel to Tokyo Drift which was a little weird. Nonetheless, great film that is probably better than any of the prior ones other than the first of course.",Bruce722,2013-06-05,2013
7.0,at it again,"with these movies coming out to the theatre every other year now, and now I just looked on this site fast n furious 7 2014. I need to catch up with the series. Paul Walker returns with Vin Diesel along with Michelle rodriguez for #4. there are a lot more bad guys in this film I thought the idea of the Mexican drug cartel presented a few new ideas. there is lot's of action to be had here, the gasoline tanker's explosion,, the chases with all of the cars in the Mexican tunnels, with the chopper in pursuit of all of the vehicles. I like the idea of using the border as a character in the movie. because apparently you can only be tracked for so long either before or after you get across the border, I forget how that works. but there is lot's of good one liners in here for our characters to chew up, love all of the fast cars and the faster women,, although I wonder how many of these movies can they keep making,, don't get me wrong I like them very much, but at some point you have to sit back and say , I think we need something else.",kairingler,2013-07-08,2013
5.0,Semi Mindless Action film,"Fast and Furious is certainly everything it promises, but that isn't a whole lot. We get all kinds of suped up cars that will give any sixteen year old the hots and the babes to make the illegal car racing all the more glamorous.Now when I say it's all babes and cars I mean it, there isn't any new character development in any of the characters and the action, while good, is extremely basic, but at least it isn't terrible.Entertaining for a viewing but it doesn't give us anything new to a franchise that has been extremely one note from the get go. Enjoy it and watch the racers act like rock stars! a very modest 6 out of 10",blindredemption,2009-04-05,2009
6.0,Fun but familiar,"Once again, it follows the same plot points as some of the previous installments but Fast and Furious is still fun and its beginning to embrace the ridiculousness. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker give great performances and it's nice to see them back in the same film. John Ortiz is a really good villain. The action and car chases are also really good as usual.",masonsaul,2019-07-26,2019
7.0,Oh right we forgot the epilogue....all Furious but lacking fast...,"So what is Fast and Furious? It's not a remake, or a reboot, and although it would appear to be a sequel it really is ultimately a recap to the very first film...or the second I forget. It has been so long since I've seen the original two films which this one is a direct follow up to. I kind of wish I had watched the first two before seeing this because it may have helped with the overall characters and plot. They do still try to link together not just the first two films but all the movies which I give them kudos for because I actually thoroughly enjoyed Tokyo Drift. So here comes Fast and Furious, barely changing the title from the first one but bringing back the original cast that defined the series. The thing that caught me the most about this film is it is not about car racing anymore. Really the film is about drug trafficking and despite a huge car/truck stunt in the first scene Fast and Furious lacks much of anything fast at all. All the other installments of the series have focused on the cars and the sexy sleek speed of everything but Fast and Furious tries to turn that around by giving it a different edge. Vin Diesel thrives in a Fast and Furious movie like this one or it's predecessors. It even brings out a little bit of actor in him. This is part of the reason I think he has trouble staying afloat in other films because he is Dominic Toretto. They really try to give him some depth in this installment which works okay but you really just want to see him race. I'm not sure he can do much else outside these movies. Paul Walker...remember when he was the IT boy? He returns to his role as tainted Federal Agent Brian O'Connor. Diesel and Walker still have oddly good chemistry together and they work better together as a crime fighting team then racing adversaries. Walker is not much different than he is ever been and just kind of looks pretty and does the bare minimum to stay afloat. Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez return to their roles in the film very briefly, enough to say they were there but give very little extra to the plot or their characters other than a little bit of sexual tension between Brewster and Walker who are like the power couple of the series. The villain of the film is played by John Ortiz and does a very solid job. If only the heroes of the film had the same depth this movie could have been as good as it's previous installments. Some people feel that the entire Fast and The Furious franchise is simply about cars and hot stars and if that is the only thing that holds this together and makes you want to see it than I suppose you won't be remotely disappointed in this one. The hot faces and cars are still there but without the same level of the street racing that the earlier one focused on. The only issue with this film is that they don't work on the existing characters at all. It's like they take the exact same characters from the first movie and port them into this movie with no continuation of them or growth to them. Diesel and Walker just feel very empty and you keep waiting for more of them. Fortunately the action and the work of director Justin Lin who has previously proved with mainstream films like Tokyo Drift and Annapolis that he can tell a great story without a lot of fluff or frills. There is nothing wrong with Fast and Furious except that it feels rushed and slapped together. It is very impressive that they were able to bring back everyone from the original film for the most part. Fans of the series will likely still be impressed. 7/10",Robert_duder,2009-07-12,2009
7.0,Not a great movie but an entertaining one,"This movie isn't the best movie of all time it isn't great cinema it is not citizen kane or the godfather and not die hard, or ocean 11 for action crime movies but is is a very entertaining movie with a badass vin diesel
the acting is cheesy but the action and the cinematography is great in my opinion it is one of the best popcorn flicks it has explosions, car chases, racing, and a drug lord.",michomkhairallah,2020-12-19,2020
7.0,Better than the 1st movie,"I just saw this and to be honest I was hesitant in buying the $8 matinée ticket but wanted to see a movie and figured what the heck. First of all the 1st film was good, IMO the sequel and then Tokyo Drift were pretty bad but the 4th installment gave a ray of hope when I first saw the trailer. I liked the fact that it had a large part of the original cast.I enjoyed this film and was surprised. They actually wrote a good story and it flowed very well, the action and driving scene's were shot and edited superbly, you did get the feeling that you were in the car at times which adds to the intensity of the driving scenes. I also like the fact that they incorporated American muscle cars instead of just imports this way the movie will appeal to people of all tastes. Overall I was pleasantly surprised of how good the film was. Also the final scene of Phoenix's demise was different than the norm. Bottom line Go see it.",tonyzeno75,2009-04-04,2009
10.0,An awesome kind-of reboot to the franchise...,"I was honestly so happy when this movie happened. I am a huge fan of The Fast And The Furious, and sadly, 2 Fast 2 Furious and The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift, did not meet my expectations. I just thought they changed too much. This movie brings everyone back, and the story goes back to where it was born and where it made fans love the sport of drag racing even more. This movie is pretty much about Dominic Toretto. He's a street racer and a thief, who is still wanted by the law and other criminals. He decides it's safer to cut himself off from everyone in his life, including his sister, Mia and his girlfriend, Letty. But after Letty is killed, things need to change. Brian O'Conner, Dominic's old friend, turned rival, turned friend, is still working at the FBI and decides that he'll help Dom get answers about Letty's death. They go undercover to uncover a drug-smuggler, who just happens to be connected to Letty. Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.",taylorkingston,2015-04-26,2015
7.0,back to the basics,"Towards the end of Tokyo Drift (2006) we saw a Vin Diesel returning. People were eager to wait if he really was coming back and he finally did here in number 4. And it do returns to the end of part 2. They only mention Tokyo once at the beginning with Han (Sung Kang) but none of the other actors from that part are here to see except for Han.A return in fact to part 1 with Vin Diesel (Dominic Torreto) and Paul Walker (Brian O'Connor) in the main lead. The are teaming again together. From that moment we do see a classic Fast and Furious. Full of fast cars and chasing cars and of course here and there some nice chicks. The story was solid and gave people really what they want and not going to deep into the technical details of the cars like the first part or with clichés. Still, this is not for everybody but people who really love action with fast cars and a simple solid story they should pick up this franchise.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",trashgang,2013-09-26,2013
1.0,A Bugs Bunny Cartoon is More Credible,"Ridiculous opening sequence where they unhook the tankers on a 4-tanker gas transport rig in the Dominican Republic. Letty is running along the top of the tankers without falling off. Cars and pickup trucks going 70 mph in reverse and hooking up the tankers. Nicely shot, but completely ludicrous. The rest of the film was dumb, too. If Dom loved Letty, he wouldn't have left her in he middle of the night and not contacted her in 5 years. Brian is as awkward as a 15 year old throughout. The premise of driving through abandoned Mexican mine shafts at 80 mph was bizarrely dumb. At one point, Dom opened the door to his Charger and jumped into another car, commandeering it. All the while driving 80 mph in a mine shaft! I am not kidding!!! The ending was equally idiotic. Suffice it to say that prison buses have armed guards and police radios.",qormi,2011-01-17,2011
9.0,Now were talking again,"A couple of nights ago I just got done watching F&F Tokyo Drift.....I wish they would've left that one out of this magnificent series. It made ZERO sense that they would do a sequel without any of the main people from the previous movie. I gave that one a rating 6 out of 10 and I was probably being too nice.But this one one, on the other hand.....brilliant. 9 out of 10!!!! The old characters are back, better story, better cars, better action.....awesome. The beginning had me clutching my chair and moving my head and body like I was actually there. Paul Walker (RIP)and Vin Diesel were amazing in this one as usual. It just gets me excited to watch the next one in the series.Show me a classic Dodge/Plymouth, and I will be a fan forever.",NoMoreFreaks,2014-01-02,2014
7.0,Furiously Dangerous,"This might bring the audience a lot of questions about the return of the characters Brian O'Connor and specially Han Seoul-Oh after the events in The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift. Fast & Furious is the sequel to the previous films 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003), followed by The Fast And The Furious (2001) and the prequel to The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006).What that made this Fast & Furious to be a better sequel than the 2003 film 2 Fast 2 Furious is that all the original casts return in this one. Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, Paul Walker as Brian O'Connor, Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto and Michelle Rodriguez as Leticia ''Letty'' Ortiz. The film also introduces new characters Fenix (Laz Alonso), Omar (Don Omar), Leo Tego (Tego Calderon), Cara Mirtha (Mirtha Michelle) and Campos (John Ortiz). Sung Kang who played Han Seoul-Oh in Tokyo Drift has also made a special appearance. We can briefly say that this is the direct sequel to the 2001 film. It begins from where it ended.The film focuses mostly on swag, sex appeal, action, hunt and most importantly on the American Muscle cars. Why the film holds my attention is because the film promises on what is says in it's title: Fast & Furious. It's definitely more fast and more furious than the original one. It has passed 8 years since the last time Vin Diesel portrayed the character Dominic Toretto. He has pumped up his body and fits perfectly to be the legend of street racing. Paul Walker who portrayed Brian O'Connor is still phenomenal as he has always been in the previous Fast & Furious films. Laz Alonso and John Ortiz have lived up in their roles.Overall this is a perfect Saturday-night movie.

4.0,All jumps and explosions but no story,"This is a movie for the guys. Hot chicks, fast cars, big explosions, big stunts and big tuff men. But it's no movie for serious movie goers. No story, worthless sequel and just an excuse for a quick buck. Even though it had the same things the original had it didn't have the same effect. It was pretty much empty.Even though the movie was bad it still had some awesome stunts. One of the only reasons this was watchable was the stunts. Everyone loves to see loud cars roaring through the air while a massive explosion burns behind them.Back to where it started. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Michelle Rodriguez back together again. Another reason this was watchable. But they had to go ruin it by making a bad decision with one of the characters.I recommend it if you like the series. It's really a hit or miss with this movie. A fan may find it better or worse then the previous movies. It should be decided on your own. I give Fast & Furious...4/10",Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews,2009-07-20,2009
7.0,Let's make some money....,"When Dominic Toretto is informed that Letty was assassinated, he returns to Los Angeles to find her killer. His former friend and FBI agent Brian Conner is assigned to capture mysterious drug lord Braga that is looking for replacement drivers, working undercover as his courier, driving from Mexico to USA through the desert. Dominic discovers that Letty was working as a courier for Braga when she was killed and he decides to join his gang to find the killer...... After the awful third movie, and the waning careers of the two leads, it was inevitable that this was eventually going to happen, and even though its lots and lots of fun, its bonkers beyond belief. Films like this are critic proof, they are all about fast cars, explosions, hot women and cool locations. Pretty much like a Michael Bay movie, but with taste. Diesel and Walker are not the best actors around, but their chemistry is undeniable, and they make a great pair. As with all sequels, they try to be bigger and better than the last one, and here it succeeds, because Lin knows these movies are ridiculous, so makes every set piece ridiculous also. So all in all, its a fine movie, totally off its rockers, but it knows it, and embraces it.",FlashCallahan,2014-05-05,2014
7.0,one of the better entries in the franchise,"Fast and Furious is, in my opinion one of the high points of the Fast franchise. I could enjoy The Fast and the Furious for what it was. 2 Fast 2 Furious I could not really get into despite the awesome races. Fast and Furious is where I started to like and get into the franchise. There are many reasons for why this is.I find the characters to be much better this time around. Vin Diesel's character, Dom toretto, is back with a vengeance. Him being back, and his character arc in this is one of the main reasons I like this film more than the previous ones. At the start of the film he leaves his gang because the police are gunning for him. He then gets a call from his sister saying Letty (Michelle Rodriguez's character) has been killed. Now Toretto is on a revenge mission to kill the person who killed Letty.(in fast and furious 6 we find out she isn't though.) This makes it more of a personal story for the characters, especially Toretto, which I like. I am also a fan of revenge stories, which made me enjoy this more.I like Paul Walker's character, Brian o Connor, more here than any of the previous films. He seems more mature and professional here. In this film he has been reinstated as an FBI agent. I still do not really buy him as an FBI agent; he does come off as more professional and less of a punk in this movie. Jordana Brewster, from the first film, comes back as Mia, who is Brian's love interest. I thought she was fine, but she is not given much to do. The other characters are not much. Han Lu form Tokyo Drift returns here, as well as Letty. However, they only show-up in the beginning and then disappear from the movie. This story is really about Brian and Toretto.The villain is also very lazy. The Fast films have never had strong villains, but I find this one particularly weak. The villain in this movie along with the villain in the first film is probably my least favourite villains of these movies.The races are still fun to watch. The races here are probably some of my favourite of the franchise. Although there is some very obvious CGI used in some of the races and car chases which might take you out. There was CGI used in the previous films as well, but here it is particularly noticeable. The CG did irk me, but it did not ruin the action.Overall, Fast and Furious is my second favourite Fast film so far. I definitely like it more than the films before it. I like the darker tone, as well as Vin Diesel and his character arc. The races were also good despite the noticeable CGI. For those who are fans of this franchise give this a look if you have not already.",Tyson14,2015-04-07,2015
6.0,"Fourth entry full of noisy action , thrills and overwhelming car pursuits","The drivers, the cars and the Drift races are the real stars of this movie , well directed on Mexico location , in Los Angeles , Long Beach , Pasadena, and Backlot Universal Studios. This is an exciting narration of drifting auto racing with exceptionally fine camera work and great car chase sequences and crashes on the metropolitan streets and tunnels. Heading back to the streets where it all began, two men rejoin two women to blast muscle, tuner and exotic cars across Los Angeles and floor through the Mexican desert. When a murder brings them back to L.A., fugitive ex-con Dominic Toretto ( Vin Diesel ) reignites his confrontation with agent Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) . But as they are forced to fight a shared enemy named Campos ( John Ortiz ) and Fenix ( Laz Alonso ) , Dom and Brian must give in to an uncertain new trust if they hope to vanquish him. They are helped by the Toretto's sister ( Jordana Brewster ), former Brian's girlfriend . And from convoy heists to precision tunnel crawls across US-Mexican border , two contenders will find the best way to get vendetta : push the limits of what's possible behind the car .The picture blends action-packed, suspense , chills , tension , exciting car pursuits, thriller , a little bit of violence and spectacular sequences though won't mean much on little screen TV . Flashy, noisy race-cars set in Panama , California and Mexico by the producers , - the famous Neal Moritz - of the previous parts. Pulse-quickening action but plenty of clichés and lots of dirty driving and heavier on crashes than coherency . All stunts were performed by authentic experts without people damage. Justin Lin's direction ( he previously made ¨ Annapolis ¨ and ¨Better Luck tomorrow¨ ) is competent though the story eventually run out of gas . Justin Lin directed the third part titled ¨Tokio drift¨ with Lucas Black and Sonny Chiba , the first and second entry were directed by Rob Coen with similar protagonists to this fourth outing. All of them were lavishly produced by Neal Moritz and also by Vin Diesel. The movie gives new meaning to the term ¨Tuning¨ and ¨Drifting¨. The flick will appeal to adrenaline lovers and those young people looking for strong emotions. This is the kind of film in which the cars enthusiastic will enjoy immensely , it's a must see for cars fonds.",ma-cortes,2010-05-22,2010
7.0,feels like we're back home,"Beastly movie. Awesome action, great racing scenes, good story. Lots of creative ways to improve on the racing parts. Hate-able villains. So many awesome intense scenes and omg moments. Was pretty deep like the original movie with some good emotional moments and character relationships. Even small things reminded me that we're back in the world created by the original, like dinner with family with a nice song playing, or mia yelling ""dom stop!"" lolit has lots of flaws but this movie is a great time. It brought the series back to where it needed to be. It captured the feel of the first movie. And i wonder if it gave them the confidence to go all in on fast 5 and subsequent movie-films (random borat reference lol) (4 viewings, 6/18/2021)",FeastMode,2019-06-25,2019
9.0,Can't Wait for the Fifth!,"Fast and Furious is another great addition to the already great series of these movies. This movie picks up after 2 Fast 2 Furious which came out six years before this. I am really happy to see the original cast back in the film. These four people are what made this series successful(at least the first one). Toretto and O'Conner must rejoin forces in order to bring down a gang that killed a loved one of Toretto. I don't see what other people seem to see. This move has a great, emotion-driven plot. As sequel after sequel comes out, it seems like the plot has gotten better with all the car racing an afternote. I really liked the acting in this film. Vin Diesel is one of my favorite actors. I was nice to see Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez after eight years. They still look good. Overall, this is a wonderful movie. I liked the action and the drama. I rate this film 9/10.",g-bodyl,2010-03-19,2010
6.0,Fast...but not so Furious,"The fourth film in the series, Fast & Furious is full of action but misses the mark once again. In my opinion, the film is much better than the previous two, as the original cast including Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, and Michelle Rodriquez return. However, something has not returned from the original and that is the CARS. I could count the number of cars that interested me on one hand, and that is not a good thing. And once again, Paul Walker is driving a skyline and Vin Diesel is driving his American muscle. Come on where is the new stuff? Walker is an FBI agent and Diesel is his typical outlaw self. Both work together in bringing down one of the most powerful drug dealers in the country and they do a great job. The movie is full of action, with multiple entertaining action scenes. But what is missing are the most important factors of a Fast and Furious movie: street racing, tuners, and a plot people can actually relate with. The first film was so popular because, although it was a box office movie, it was full of real people and their actual cars. Fast and Furious 4 is too unrealistic with too much CGI...the director should have gone back to the roots of street racing.",Magalhaes9,2009-04-04,2009
1.0,Proof of the dumbing down of society.,"I only watched this because I watch everything no matter how bad it is. There is absolutely zero story & no purpose for this film being made at all. More than anything that proves how lazy both studios and people are becoming is the fact of the title. The 1st film which was laughable itself but a masterpiece compared to this was named ""The Fast & the Furious,"" the only difference w/this was they dropped the two ""The's."" That is not only pathetic, it's an absolute embarrassment in it's own right. If want to see the same garbage you've already seen well then you'll love this, if want to see some semblance of a plot & mean ANY kind of original plot, then for the love of god skip this. This is trash & everyone involved should be embarrassed for having any part of this. How this made $350 million worldwide is the worst of all, because now we can expect the same snooze-fest another Five Times. Boo!",TheEmulator23,2009-07-26,2009
9.0,Doms Revenge,"I was reading an article in a truckers' trade magazine,about how the druggies would load up some muscle cars in a 53' box trailer and smuggle these cars into Mexico. Then load up these cars with dope. Then, as they were headed to the border to smuggle the drugs into the U.S.; they would use some kinda jamming or cloaking device so the border agents cant detect them,as the cars drive through a tunnel under the border patrols noses.

6.0,This franchise definitely needed Vin,"Ever played a video game on acid? Neither have I, but it sure as hell would have to be pretty similar to watching this movie. Sometimes a blast, sometimes weird as heck, but always with lots of groovy colors.I like the first FnF. It introduced fun characters and the cars were cool and all. The sequels had to be pretty lame, because this franchise is nothing without Vin. Walker could be cut in a heart beat, but not our good, role-playing friend Diesel (I believe he played a wizard). Even when the going is redonkulously over the top, he remains cool as hell. I like his overly calm hero type. Let's hope he doesn't do another children's movie after this.There are a couple sweet nods to the first movie, which is always appreciated by us continuation prostitutes. Sequel must be a sequel, damn it! End chase almost ruins the movie, because it is such brain vomit it might actually make you go blind. But, there was enough of the fun times to give me strength to suffer through that debacle. Overall, a decent flick, but could have been tons better with a quality director.And yeah, it was about time to have a Mustang in there!",Ertzi,2009-08-07,2009
4.0,I was bored,"Least of the series has the original stars returning to the series to solve the murder of a mutual friend. Paul Walker turning a blind eye to the wanted Vin Diesel hopes to not only track down said killer but also get in good graces with his boss who seem to think he may have made a mistake taking him back.(I won't say more since to do so would reveal too many spoilers and several people I know were upset that reviews gave away too much-which I don't think is really possible) This is my least favorite of all of the films. Sure the races/chases/action are pretty good in an unreal Hollywood sort of way, but the rest of it just sort of lays there. Its purely by the numbers and fill in the blanks and I'm guessing that anyone who sees this will be way ahead of our stars. Me,I was bored and wondering why I bothered. Its not bad, its just dull. I felt no excitement and wondered why I bothered to run out on a Saturday night to see it. I should have waited for cable.",dbborroughs,2009-04-19,2009
6.0,Back to where it started? Not quite!,"Paul Walker and Vin Diesel together again - I was thinking this is going to be a walk down memory lane and relive the excitement of the first movie. Now the first movie was all about cars - you were cast into the world of street racers - for those who love cars, it was simply fan-tastic. The franchise of fast & furious was always about cars. The story lines were not very elaborate but the film was not supposed to be thriller or a masterpiece in cinema. But it stood out because it revolved around cars and few films have done that way. F&F4 however is another story. And indeed, story they've tried to inject in the film. That meant less time to talk about cars and anything related to the world of street racing. Yes, you will see a few races (I don't want to reveal too much) but they have tried to make F&F4 accepted by a wider audience. Fair enough! But it also means, it will have to be judged with a bigger variety of films. And I'm afraid to say, that there are better action packed thrillers out there. It is good entertainment to see good old American muscle cars ripping through the Mexican deserts and through tunnels barely large enough for your scooters but it stops there. Those who are fans of the first F&F will have to watch this 4th one but as cliché as it might sound, it does not beat the original.",Kevinator007,2009-05-24,2009
7.0,"Action, Excitement, Mystery","The Fast and the Furious series movies always continue with more excitement and action than the previous movie. The first scene of the film, as usual, appears before the audience with the peak of action and tension. The action of the first scenes allows the audience to lock on the screen throughout the movie. The movie feeds the audience to action. Dom's coming back in series 4 gives the audience what he wants, but what happened to Letty is disappointing to the audience.Adding a mystery about Braga to the movie has also contributed greatly to the audience watching the movie with curious looks.There is nothing to say to the cars, they are all very good, very fast and beautifully modified.But this movie is also overshadowed by erotic scenes like the first movie of the series. Especially the kissing scene of two girls does not like people at all. I wish they shoot the movies without adding the erotic scenes into the script.",drmuhammedsamiduru,2020-04-21,2020
6.0,Fast & Furious,"Vin Diesel and Paul Walker return to the franchise for the fourth entry after the series' diversion to Tokyo for episode 3. It obviously feels more like an F&F movie with these two in the driver's seats, and director Justin Lin knows exactly what is expected of him as he fills the screen with muscle cars engaged in hair-raising races, macho posturing and hot chicks in hot pants (one of whom is future Wonder Woman Gal Gadot). There's nothing groundbreaking about Fast & Furious, but it delivers everything that is required of it.",JoeytheBrit,2020-04-15,2020
6.0,Return of the dream team,"Paul Walker and Vin Diesel reunite in this continuation of the Fast & Furious franchise. Dominic and his crew are on the run from the law, while O'Conner has returned back to FBI. But then Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is killed and nothing will ever be the same as both Dominic and Brian seek solace for past sins.The film works mostly for the same reasons the previous films did. It's oozing with style, has very charismatic actors playing characters they were born to play, has very fast and cool cars, features a killer sound track, and is just all around fun to watch.I'd still say the original 2001 film is better, although not by much. It simply had rawer edge to it and had novelty on its side.Still, I very much enjoyed this film. Gal Gadot was a blast as a henchwoman to a drug boss, the car scenes were a ton of fun and the plot was kept well together. Plus, this film was the first step towards a grander scope when it comes to these movies. And that's never a bad thing.Not the best F&F film ever made, but a really solid entry, nevertheless.",Vartiainen,2020-05-11,2020
10.0,Fast & Furious 2.5,"I have read all previous comments and only see a couple of people that actually make a comment that it is supposed to happen between 2 Fast 2 Furious and Tokyo Drift... I'm sure this had something to do with Justin Lin directing Tokyo Drift as well as Fast & Furious. I'm glad that he made it happen that way because I am sure there were many people that saw Tokyo Drift and thought, ""Where did this movie come from?"" It was so random to have it be a Fast and Furious movie when it had nothing to do with either of the original 2 with the exception of the again, random, cameo of Dom at the end of it. In the first couple of scenes of Fast & Furious you see that Han is part of Dom's crew that hi-jacks gas tankers in the Dominican Republic. When the heat is on Dom once again, he tells Han it's time to go do his own thing. Han tells him that he hears of some things going on in Tokyo. If you recall in Tokyo drift, Han tells Sean that Tokyo is his ""Mexico"" he was running to stay out of jail.I really enjoyed this movie. The plot wasn't as detailed as the previous but it followed along well with what you think might happen in a Fast & Furious movie... Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner again, he is still working law enforcement, although this time he is big boy FBI. Vin Deisel is back as Dominic Toretto. He and Brian are trying to get in with a drug ring for different reasons, but team up to help each other get what they are after.The movie is full of everything you expect from the franchise: Nice cars, great racing, hot women and hot guys (to suit everyone's taste) This movie has great action sequences as well. I recommend this movie to anyone that has followed the other 3... or at least the first 2. If they make a 5th one I'll be first in line to see it too.",amboo61,2009-04-04,2009

ACTIONAdrenaline seems to have been lost after the first one! They returned two of it's original characters of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker but still didn't return the original director of the first witch is Rob Cohen who compromises with it's actors to make the overall film work! Plot is original which involves the transport of drugs and etc... from hired drivers, but it doesn't really match the enthusiasm what director Rob Cohen did from the very first one of this franchise. It is one of those movies when one's waiting for something exciting to happen with the next scene just as good as the last.

10.0,"""Fast & Furious"" Delivers New Model, Original Parts, and Nice Ride!","I love this series, even though it's weird that lead characters sometimes leave the succeeding films. Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, and Michelle Rodriguez are absent in ""2 Fast 2 Furious"". Even Paul Walker is absent in ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" (third film). This film comes out, and it's great to know that they bring back the original characters we love in ""The Fast and the Furious"" (first film). Brian, Dom, Letty, and Mia reunite, thus reliving the relationships they established back in the first film. Despite the conflicts, Brian and Dom team up to bring down a crime boss who import heroin from Mexico to the US.Car chases, lovable cheesy moments (but not Twilightized), and amazing fight scenes! The truck scene, desert chase, and underground tunnel chase are very intense and awesome! All praise and respect to the stunt people who plan and execute these eye candies. The title's weird, I think, because they don't use ""4"" into it. Kinda reminds me of ""The Final Destination"", the fourth movie in the ""Final Destination"" film franchise, and due to box office success, ""Final Destination 5"" came along. I like more the ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" title. Even though the title sounds funny, the number is in there. But watching the trailer, it lives up to the movie's promise, fast and furious.

Their goal is to catch a drug lord and bring him to justice, using whatever means required.I still remember watching the first ""The Fast and the Furious"", and I was super impressed by the cars and the energy of the film, even though I do not have a passion for cars. Watching the fourth installment is almost like a step back in time because it was still all about the fast cars and the furious drivers. ""Fast & Furious"" keeps the energy going by a lot of very dangerous car chases. The plot though, is not so clear to me perhaps because I do not quite remember the first three films. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed watching this film.",Gordon-11,2017-03-22,2017

7.0,The Fast and Furious series:Part 4.,"Going with a friend on the opening weekend to the local Odeon to see the unexpected revival of the Fast franchise,I was shocked by how poor the print was, with the final sequence becoming unwatchable, due to how pitch black/dimmed the colours were on the print. As we left, I did wonder if the image would look better on disc.2021: Recently reading about a friend seeing F9 at the cinema,it gave me the final kick to pick up the Blu-Ray, and return to the 4th round of the Fast saga. View on the film: Becoming the in-house director after this who nailed the style of the series with Fast 5,6 and 9, Justin Lin & cinematographer Amir Mokri signal the change in direction for the franchise with a thrilling opening failed heist set-piece. Moving at high speed, Lin places a emphasis in focusing on practical kitsch-Action dive stunts across vehicles performed by Dom's gang, rather then the speed of the sports cars. Breaking the disagreements between Dom and Brian, Lin drives in on up-close Action, with a hard-hitting punch-up between Brian and Dom, which spins into an exciting final set in tunnels, with Lin using the confined location in tight wide-shots to heighten the time crunch atmosphere of the final chase. Making her film debut, Gal Gadot gives a very good, feisty turn as Gisele, whilst Paul Walker brings a urgency to cop Brian's conflict over which to take, and Vin walks round completely unaware of what type of flick he's in, with his deadly serious performance (never change Vin.) Joined by future Suicide Squad (2016-also reviewed) director David Ayer doing uncredited re-writes, the screenplay by Fast regular Chris Morgan and Ayer changes gears at a crossroads, via the set-pieces in Dom's drive for revenge, (a regular major theme across future entries) being over the top, but treated with a serious tone, rather then kitsch, and surprisingly few mentions of ‘Family’ in the dialogue, which instead drives a building of trust between Brian and Dom as drive away fast & furious.",morrison-dylan-fan,2021-08-30,2021
7.0,Downright boring when it's not tearing up the roads.,"As is usual is with Fast & Furious movies, you know what you're getting into long before you take your seat. While it's hard to imagine anyone wilfully buying a ticket to the latest Fast & Furious romp under any other pretence, another commonality that exists within the franchise is that the movie's sole trademark and selling point too often gets submerged within lacklustre drama, plot lines and acting. Indeed, you wouldn't have a hard time convincing the average member of the public that the series itself was based upon a video game; not only does it pack the same gloss and action as your average polygonal adaptation, but it also shares the same detractive traits. If movies such as Street Fighter, Dead or Alive or countless others have taught us anything, it's that building a movie around high-octane thrills usually doesn't work if you don't have any characters or a tangible plot to latch it all on to. Sure enough, if Fast & Furious could pace itself properly and sustain momentum, this wouldn't be so much of a problem; yet as it stands, this is just another entry into an already tarnished and overdone franchise devoid of the zest it started the race with.Going over the general plot of Fast & Furious is almost futile; if you've seen any of the previous installments, you'll know the general ideas at play here. Criminals, illegal street races, conflicts between the good guys, the bad guys and the even badder guys—all caught in a turmoil of wreckage, spare car parts, nitro, elaborate stunts and even a little personal grievance for Mr. Diesel thrown in there for good measure too. The concoction has its definitive moments which do their job well; the car chases and races are potent and well choreographed, with crisp photography to capture it all in superb detail. Unfortunately however, out of about two hours of screen-time here, the movie is unbearably dull for about ninety of those minutes. The problem of course is that the characters here aren't interesting; their plights are transparently obvious and the conflicts between them are tepid to point where you know who you're supposed to be rooting for, but you probably won't really care. An example of Justin Lin's directing style is apparent early on in two great action sequences—both come before any real plot development takes place and yet the way in which the action is framed allows for it to be exciting; shame the same cannot be said for the drama which pads all this sixth-gear adrenaline rush.As far as no-brainer, stoic action movies go, Fast & Furious is about as typical as it gets. The performances, which are constantly punctuated by a ridiculously manipulative score by Brian Tyler (that doesn't work precisely because it's so over the top), fluctuate between overly-calculated machismo on the part of the male leads, and hormonally charged melodrama from the females (that is, when they're not being parades around in skimpy clothing). The resulting façade that permeates the movie is cold and uninteresting; it certainly doesn't help that the characters as they are written on paper are devoid of any real signs of depth, but with actors that bring close to nothing to any of them, Fast & Furious is more than just braindead; it's downright boring when it's not tearing up the roads.You get the sense that this is exactly what Justin Lin strived to achieve from this venture however and I guess some people will eat up the hard-bodied approach that he takes to delivering both the action and drama. Yet for anyone less interested in action-movie cutouts clinging at each other's throats for two hours (check your wallet, if there isn't a gym card in sight forget it), there won't be as much fun to be had here. When it comes down to it, Fast & Furious has the right parts to make for a thrilling movie on the basis of its action alone, yet burdened with predictable drama and lame characters, twenty minutes of high-speed thrill isn't quite worth the traffic jam of ideas that you have to suffer through to get there.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",Otoboke,2009-09-24,2009
6.0,"Not great, but not so bad as I Imagined it would be","When a crime happens, the fugitive Dominic Toretto and the agent Brian O'Connor need to re team in order to find the same enemy. They will need to work together again, but this will not be easy, since Dominic's trust in Brian is minimum, after all that happened in the past. I was imagining that this movie would be terrible. I liked the first Fast and Furious, but usually when they try to repeat the formula all the time, the result is a boring and too predictable. As an example,I was surprised to see that Letty died. In a too predictable movie, she would be a couple with Vin Diesel again, as Mia and Brian. It was good to see the primary actors from the first Fast and Furious too, since the reason I hated Fast and Furious 2 and 3, was that we don't see Dominic, Letty and Mia, only Brian. In general this movie was okay. Not an incredible thing, but not the worst thing too. I missed a bigger emotion while watching it, but being exactly as the first movie is never an easy task.",Lady_Targaryen,2009-05-23,2009
6.0,Slow & Tedious,"The general plot of the movie goes something like this: Dom (Vin Diesel) and his buds are at it again and stealing gas from poor South-American countries (I would like to think that they're doing this to destabilize a government that is based solely on irony). However, Dom realizes he can't mess with the feds that are out to get him, so naturally he takes to the road and gets the hell out of Dodge. But not for long, since a plot device that we were SO not expecting brings him to good old L.A., and by complete coincidence, in the middle of an FBI operation that has to take down a drug lord. We are told that this drug lord effectively manages to smuggle more dope than Escobar did in 10 years. While that in it's own right would just have to be pretty freaking awesome, we have to remember the fact that Escobar was responsible for about 80% of the drugs coming in and out of America in his time. Which kind of makes it obvious that this new drug lord would have to effectively control either half the U.S. fleet or literally be able to s**t transports on a daily basis... However, the movie wants to make us believe that he can do so with 4 guys a night, racing through a tunnel that just happens to be outside of the Mexican border's scanners, all the while running down from Mexico to America... Of course no one would think to post sentries there...As it turns out, Dom and Walker (Brian O'Conner) end up working on the same case, albeit for totally different reasons. In the end we get a plot twist that we SO didn't see coming, and an ending that just screams for another sequel to be made. Normally I'd say HELL YES! to something like that, if the movie had been what I expected. Read what follows to see why my response was something more on the lines of ""I'll see another one of these if you guys let me in for free. And give me hot chicks... or at least a free soda."".Why directors will choose to take the fun out of an otherwise brainless movie is something that will always manage to elude me. It somehow falls into the same category as things like why I can never find magical leprechauns that will hand me money or why some studios green-light scripts that smell of brain-fart from a mile away.I mean... I can totally understand that the movie chooses to pimp slap reality while screaming ""Who's your driver daddy!"" (I sometimes like to believe that it also throws in a sucker-punch every now and then), because that's what makes it fun. But then again, if you walk into a ""Fast & Furious"" movie expecting realism, you probably deserve the aforementioned treatment yourself... applied by Gremlins (because we all know how terrifying a Gremlin screaming ""Who's your daddy"" would be).Just to get this out of the way, I like cars. I love tuned cars. I love hot women that choose to wear belts as skirts, or wear dresses that don't have enough material to cover up 30% of their body. And if the movie had 90% of that and the rest had been composed entirely of Vin Diesel kicking a** and taking names while displaying absolutely no remorse or guilt, then I would have loved this movie. So much so, that I probably would have given it a 10 just for being composed of THAT much awesome (ok maybe a 9 because it just wouldn't have been in the same class of awesome as ""The Dark Knight""... unless one of the racing cars was the Batmobile, and the chicks around Batman had been dressed in Catwoman outfits).But no... instead we get 30% car racing and general bad-a**, 20% of Vin Diesel looking as if he's about to s**t bricks considering how muscularly constipated he looks, coupled with general bad-a**, and 50% I'm-sorry-for-banging-your-sister-and-then-taking-off-without-even leaving-a-note tear-jerking dialog that was hackneyed at best and cringe-worthy at worst. It basically sounded like a rejected sketch for a James Bond movie in which Sean Connery starts telling his newly acquired babe that it's too dangerous for her to stay around him, because he's got like... ninjas after him... or something. The reasons why that wouldn't stick are: 1. Sean Connery's brass testicles wouldn't allow him to utter such a thing.2. We all know James Bond probably doesn't care all that much.3. We all know WE wouldn't care all that much.In this case, reasons 1 and 3 apply more than ever. Why? Could it have to do with the fact that we get to know so little of the characters that we utterly can not give less of a rat's a** about them? Bingo! Because seriously... I didn't pay the admission price to weep at tear-jerking drama. I paid to watch fast cars and hot chicks. If I want depth, I'll watch ""Slumdog Millionaire"" or ""The Wrestler"", or ""Seven Pounds"". If I want hot spoilers and rims, and cars that have jet-engines put in them I'll probably just play Need for Speed. At least that game allows me not to care whether or not I kill innocent bystanders, let alone if any of the main characters gets dumped by their girlfriend or anything like that.",moldo_bmf,2009-04-05,2009
6.0,Don't waste your money,"I just wasted 2 hours of my live and $8 watching this piece of crap film. The only thing that kept me in my seat until the end was my love of the original F&F movie. I was glad that this one brought back the original cast, but seriously - the writers and directors of this one should be shot, along with the makers of that lame ass Tokyo Drift"". The acting was so beyond bad that I couldn't watch at times. One car race scene (in the city) was awesome, but the rest of the movie just looked like a cheap James Bond / Jason Bourne ripoff. Don't waste your money on this one, wait until it comes out on DVD and then you can watch it at home and make all the fun you want of it!",amanda_n_byrum,2009-04-04,2009
8.0,Much better than expected,"Okay, I went into this thinking, ‘It's gonna suck’ because by definition, I hate car racing movies. But then again, i thought, ‘Hey, this movie made 80 million in the box office, it can't be that bad..’ I was surprised at how good it was. It was much better then expected. A little hard to follow at times, and the directing isn't that good (like a Michael Bay film, it's very choppy.. the director never stays on one scene). The acting was pretty good, and like usual, Vin Deisel is badass. The plot is kind of realistic, which is a plus. If someone else had of directed the movie, then it would definitely be much better. Don't watch the movie if you epilepsy, because you'll be having seizures.. It's also very loud at times, but car racing movies SHOULD be loud. Good use of Dolby Digital surround sound...",lqe,2009-06-10,2009
6.0,This is Fast and Furious!,"With the biggest budget in the Fast and Furious series, you can expect longer car chase scenes and see more cars crashing into each other. This seems to be the proper sequel to 2001 movie with all of the original cast. Yeah, this seems to be the best of the series. It has some of the best car chase scenes in the movies and the story is thrilling with suspense.The story: This has an actual story that manages to thrill unlike the previous sequel. Paul Walker and Vin Diesel are back to lead in the movie. Can't say much about the story, but it does pack some thrills and suspense with car racing/chasing scenes. There is nothing special about the story but it is at least entertaining and thrilling. Those who just get the thrill in seeing beautiful and sexy cars being smashed, this one don't disappoint. Cars toppling onto each other, cars smashing into each other. Plus there are hot babes. Looks good, right? Overall: Those who love the Fast and Furious series should obviously catch this one. Those who love car racing movies, this one don't disappoint. Those who love to see cars smashing each other and find that there are not many movies recently doing that, this one shall thrill you. I enjoyed it for the story and car chase scenes and nothing more.",helmutty,2009-04-05,2009
5.0,Fast and Furious....more like stalled and burnt out,"There are times when a movie can be fully overshadowed by its trailer - Miami Vice is one, X-Men3 is another, (although the flaws in that movie will haunt for the rest of my time in this life and the next). Fast and Furious is one of those movies. The trailer far exceeds the movie in terms of action, acting and excitement. I have to make it clear I didn't like The Fast and The Furious, I have never even seen 2 Fast 2 Furious but I loved Tokyo Drift but there I was on opening night in a completely packed out screen one. The movie starts off so well, straight into the action with a good car heist. Then the action stops for what seems like forever so that we can get the obligatory back story of this movies villain. This is a normal process in any movie but Fast and Furious' main flaw was that its two male leads cannot act. They look good running, they look good when they are driving, they look bad-ass when they are frowning but for the love of god don't give either of them more than two lines of dialogue per scene!! After some awful awful scenes with dialogue we were treated to the second of (only!) four car scenes in the entire movie. The race scene should have been filled with great driving stunts and action but it was broken up to much with bad cutting, the insertion of strange CGI mapping effects and was narrated by Sally Frickin' Sat-Nav. I'm sure Johnny-Special-Effects loved making the road map for the audience to follow but seriously, stick to the driving - giving the audience a heads up that Vin Diesel and Paul Walker should take the ‘next right’ really just took away from the excitement of the scene. The dialogue was woefully written and wasn't helped by the cast who really should be seen and not heard. The wittiest quips were sexualised car innuendos but that was to be expected but the smug look on Vin Diesel face every time he uttered one was like watching a monkey figure out how to use a knife and fork. For the love of god Vin you make a reasonable action hero but do not kid yourself you can act or are in the slightest bit amusing. The plot didn't matter. I love my movies but when I go to see an action movie I expect action. I don't expect, especially given the acting talent that we had the pleasure of watching, proceedings to be taken too seriously. Fast and Furious wasn't supposed to believe it was a serious drug crime movie...it was supposed to be an action movie with lots of good car scenes. There were to many gaps between action scenes and these were mostly filled with the most unbelievable bunch of FBI agents, including Paul Walker and some rather amusing scenes of Vin Diesel trying to portray emotion. When the driving scenes came they were quite good, although nothing original was to be seen anywhere on screen and judging by the imaginative title idea of just dropping the ‘the's’ I don't know why I was surprised. The cars, of course where the most gorgeous items on screen, that's right the cars, even those that had exploded and were in flames still had more screen presence than Paul Walker could only ever dream of having. The cars stole the show and when the cars were actually allowed to race they were awesome. I would give the movie 5/10. If it wasn't for the fact that the cars were fantastic I would've been out of there. Skip Fast and Furious and go straight onto Tokyo Drift which had better action, better actors and had at least the common decency to embrace the fact that it was a movie about cars and fun and not pretend to be a drama with a few car scenes thrown in. Fast and Furious failed its MOT. See Vin you aren't the only one who can make a car pun.",Neenee-b,2009-04-11,2009
8.0,Great Popcorn Entertainment,"Brian O'Conner is now working for the FBI on a thin leash, with no room for error. When Dom finds out that Letty was murdered, he sets all his morals aside to catch the people responsible. Not only that, but Dom is forced to accept help from the man who betrayed his trust, Brian O'Conner. I've seen this movie three times now, and it never fails to entertain me. After two sequels that weren't up to par with the first movie, they went all out to make sure this franchise was back on track. What better way to revitalize the series than with the return of Vin Diesel. He had a brief cameo at the end of Tokyo Drift, but this was his first movie since the first. I wouldn't call the plot fantastic or anything, but it definitely has more story to it than usual (IMO).The stakes are much higher emotionally. There are some legitimately good twists and turns in this movie as well. But we all know why we watch these movies, the action. Let me just say that they won't disappoint you. There are some exhilarating action sequences in this movie that don't give you time to breath. The opening scene is spectacular and the finale is excellent as well. It keeps the formula of fast cars, hot women, hunky guys, and rap music. I do have to say the action looked far more professional, continuing this trend in 5 & 6. My only carp about the action, is some shaky camera work at times. This is especially noticeable during an exciting foot race between Walker and a criminal. The performances won't win any Oscars, but they are a lot of fun to watch. Paul Walker's maturity shows as an actor at this juncture. He always had presence, but his performance is rock solid in this one. Vin Diesel isn't that great at emotion. He doesn't really do much when it comes to Letty's death like he should have, but he has plenty of charisma and screen presence. It was fun to see him paired with Walker once again. That p******s called Corona that you drink has gotta go though, bro. Craft beer is much tastier. Jordana Brewster does fine with what she had to do, but I felt her storyline with Walker wasn't explored enough. Michelle Rodriguez plays her part adequately as Letty. She had a jail term to serve, so I imagine that's why she was killed off. The villains are pretty weak in this one. They weren't that menacing in my opinion. The ending does a great job of jerking emotions from you. I have to give it credit. This is the definition of popcorn entertainment. If you want a thought provoking film, look elsewhere. If you want over a 100 minutes of exciting action that will make you go ‘F yeah!’ this is your ticket. Action junkies will love this one. I know I did!",callanvass,2014-03-14,2014
7.0,A Nutshell Review: Fast & Furious,"The tagline caught my attention, promising a brand new movie with the original cast of Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster. With the relative box office success of the first film, the sequel 2 Fast 2 Furious saw only Walker returning, with Tyrese trying very hard to step into the big frame of Diesel's without much success. Tokyo Drift picked up the adrenaline from the East's Initial D, injecting the franchise with some Asian flavour, though the only good thing out of that was the introduction of Sung Kang's character Han. So the 4th movie tries to bring together all the best characters to appease fans, and the timeline of this installment sits snugly in between the first and second movies where we learn that Han and Toretto do go all the way back together. Perfect.Vin Diesel had The Fast and the Furious back in 2001 to thank for in making him a household name, where every fan boy out there left the theatres chanting his name and wishing they could emulate his road stunts if given a car as powerful as that in the film. However we know how he turned his back on a franchise, and how his film career had turned out recently, with stinkers such as Babylon A.D. crowding out his filmography. If he's sorely in need of a return to form, then I guess it doesn't take much rocket science to figure out that he would be tempted to return to his Dominic Toretto roots after his cameo in Tokyo Drift.It was smart of Justin Lin to have featured Torretto in his film then just to whet the appetites of fans everywhere, and to helm this installment by trying to top the first film by getting the first cast all back. However, some parts do get rusty after so long, and in wanting to stamp his authority over the original, had made some drastic decisions in order to keep the engine fine tuned and purring. Since it's before the second movie, Toretto is still an outlaw, and Paul Waker's Brian O'Conner is now working for the FBI, before his unexplained turn to crime in 2 Fast 2 Furious, which gets explained here, if you wish of course.The plot doesn't drift away from the standard cop-robber formula, with a cat and mouse game brewing involving a drug run from Mexico and the USA making use of expert drivers to be couriers between the two countries. And when murder is in the name of the game, Toretto gets involved for vengeance, and O'Conner, well, just doing his job. It's just an excuse to see the Diesel-Walker team up, and the franchise's formula dictates plenty of random scantily clad girls gyrating in front of the camera, while hot cars with modified engines gleam seductively under dim garages, and the screeching of tyres when tearing up the roads.If a race movie is not your cup of tea (after so many copycats have come out to milk fans of the genre), then this franchise offers nothing new. Granted that Hollywood doesn't do car chases like it used to, relying a lot now on plenty of computer animation and graphics to spice up the sequences and entertain. Those itching to see a lot of action will have to contend with only 4 major set action pieces, with 2 of which happen in the same tunnel, one bringing back memories from the first film in a heist that doesn't go exactly right, and one being the nod back to Tokyo Drift in having a downtown city area night time race.Fans of the franchise will still find this a worthy addition, but everyone else would wonder why the effort. If this film continues to make money, I won't be surprised if the next film picks up from where Tokyo Drift left off, maybe with the return of Lucas Black's Sean Boswell joining the new crew in a new adventure, with new cars to smash, new babes to romance, and more nitro to burn up the tracks.",DICK STEEL,2009-04-04,2009
3.0,"Dumb, Dull and Boring!","Fast and Furious is the fourth movie in the series, set five year after the original and set before ‘Tokyo Drift’. This time the original cast is back behind the wheel. Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Paul Walker and Vin Diesel. Heading back to the streets. After his girlfriend Letty is gunned down after doing a job for drug dealers (which Dom told her not to do after he wanted out), fugitive ex-con Dom Toretto reignites his feud with FBI agent Brian O'Connor. But as they are forced to confront the same enemy, Dom and Brian must give in to an uncertain new trust if they hope to outmaneuver him. The story of this movie is just plain dumb, its dull and boring! Its not a fast and furious movie at all. Its more of the drama and crime mystery movie. There's only two major racing scenes in the movie in the 107 minute running time. The racing scenes when they do come aren't spectacular they are just dull and boring and we have seen it all before in the previous films. (Muscle car vs Japanese import). Things in this movie are just plain stupid and silly, like the ending where a Subaru Impreza WRX STI can keep up with a 900hp supercharged Dodge Charger! (Whatever). They couldn't even make it look good on film! I know that 2 Fast 2 Furious had silly and unrealistic scenes with an Evo 7 beating a SS Yenko Camaro but they still made it nail biting and look good, that's not the case in this movie. In other words this movie makes 2 Fast 2 Furious look like a masterpiece! Its a shame that I disliked this movie the love the Fast and Furious series a lot but this one just didn't have the passion like the previous films had. See it and make your own mind up about it. But for me it was dumb, dull and boring!",killbill_28,2009-04-16,2009
6.0,Entertaining,"There is no doubt that the first half of the film is the best of the movie which involve 2 great action sequences, one at the beginning in the highway that one could watch a small part in the movie's trailer and the other it's a race at night in the city's streets in the middle of the traffic, after the latter sequence the movie diminish a lot in its quality until the end. I think this film deserves 6.5 stars, even though I have to say that it was much better of what I expected.Dominic and Brian meet again and join forces, the first one to get revenge for losing a very close person and the other to catch the boss of a drug mafia ......6.5 stars = regular +",butchfilms,2009-04-07,2009
7.0,An Adrenaline-Packed Ride That Ignites the Franchise,"In ""Fast and Furious,"" the fourth installment of the high-octane franchise, director Justin Lin reunites the original core cast in a thrilling ride that revives the essence of what made the series so popular. The plot follows street racer Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and FBI agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) as they reluctantly join forces to bring down a dangerous drug lord.The film successfully reignites the adrenaline-fueled essence of the franchise, delivering heart-pounding action sequences that will have you gripping the edge of your seat. The high-speed chases through crowded city streets and breathtaking stunts showcase the franchise's trademark blend of fast cars, intense driving skills, and daredevil maneuvers.What sets ""Fast and Furious"" apart is the emphasis on the characters' emotional journey. Dom's struggle to protect his family and maintain his code of loyalty adds depth to his character, while Brian's internal conflict between his duty as an agent and his loyalty to his friend adds a layer of complexity. The chemistry between Diesel and Walker is palpable, and their performances anchor the film with a genuine sense of camaraderie.The film also introduces new characters, such as Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and Han (Sung Kang), who bring their own unique personalities and skills to the mix. The dynamic between the old and new characters creates a sense of camaraderie and adds an extra layer of excitement to the story.The sleek cinematography captures the vibrant energy of the street racing culture, with stunning visuals that immerse you in the fast-paced world of underground racing. The pulsating soundtrack perfectly complements the exhilarating action sequences, adding an extra layer of intensity to the experience.""Fast and Furious"" is a triumphant return to the franchise's roots, delivering the perfect blend of heart-pounding action, thrilling stunts, and compelling characters. It reinvigorates the series, setting the stage for the high-speed adventures to come. Whether you're a die-hard fan or new to the franchise, this installment will leave you eagerly anticipating what lies ahead. Buckle up, because the ""Fast and Furious"" saga is back in full throttle.",sufyaanrashid95,2023-11-19,2023
6.0,The self-titled film in the Fast & Furious franchise.,"Fast & Furious is the springboard that takes the series from being a trilogy focusing on car culture to an over-the-top, juggernaut action film franchise. A litmus test to see if viewers are ready to leave ""grounded"" action behind and buckle in for some super-human-type action that prioritizes badassery above all.The plot is a mess, even by Fast & Furious standards, but the plot is far from the most important aspect of making a great Fast & Furious film. It does feel unique from others as it features the most tension between Brian and Dom, while also giving us a Detective Dom acting like Batman.",mediatation,2024-06-21,2024

8.0,"Not a bad entry, way better than 2 Fast 2 Furious","Okay, I love this series. It has good looking, along with fast cars, decent performances, and interesting back stories. Fast and Furious is sort of a mix between the last three entries, and that is where this one will either make or lose an audience.The past three were about showing off both tuner and muscle cars while putting them in some very cool situations. The first two were about plain drag and street racing, while Tokyo Drift was about drifting with a couple of street races thrown in for good measure. This one again mixes all three together. In one showcase scene, four racers are scrambling to make it to be the first across the finish line about five miles down the road. They are racing past, into, and around oncoming traffic using street racing and drifting tactics. However, my only gripe about the cars is that they don't seem to be top focus here. Don't get me wrong, Dom's Charger and Bryan trademark car from 2F2F, the Skyline, is back, along with some other cool automotive toys, but aren't used to the effect of the first three.Where this movie shines is in it's presentation. This Fast and Furious is focused on and has, wait for it, a good story fueling (excuse the bad pun) this entry. While nowhere near Oscar or the Academy Awards material, this is fan service to every extent of the meaning. Jordana Brewster, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Vin Diesel, and even Sung Kang (as Han), return for this movie, along with giving decent performances While definitely continuing the story of the first, I didn't hear any references to the events of 2F2F. I'm wondering if they know themselves that that one was a mistake? BTW, this story takes place between 2F2F and Tokyo Drift, if Han returning wasn't any indication.Overall, fans of the series should like this one, and ranks right up there with the first and Tokyo Drift. If you are not a fan, don't go in thinking this movie is going to be revolutionary or extraordinary, like critics. Instead, just think about having fun watching an action packed thrill-ride that is about two hours long.",codehorizon,2009-04-06,2009
7.0,The original cast returns,"After a thrilling prologue where Dominic Toretto and his team steal petrol tankers in the Dominican Republic the group breaks up before the cops can catch up with them. Then the story proper begins; one of the team is killed in Los Angeles so Dom risks imprisonment by returning to LA, where he is determined to discover who did it and take his revenge. Using his knowledge of the local street racing scene he traces the killer's car back to drug lord Arturo Braga. Brian O'Conner is also back in LA, working on an FBI in an operation to bring down Braga and his smuggling operation. Inevitably Brian and Dom are soon tearing up the streets as they compete for a position as one of Braga's drivers. Dom wins the position but Brian gets another position after arranging the arrest of another driver. Their first job sees them smuggling heroin through a secret tunnel from Mexico during which Dom learns the killer's identity but their troubles are far from over and neither is the excitement. After a third instalment that saw an entirely new cast racing in Japan it was good to get back to the original cast in the original city. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker have a great chemistry in these films even when their characters are going up against each other one knows they will ultimately work together. For the most part there are no real surprises although it came as a genuine shock when we learn the identity of the friend of Dom that was murdered as the actor playing the part was high up the cast list I won't give any further clues to their identity even though it becomes apparent very early in the film. As one would expect there are plenty of scenes involving cars travelling at speed; these are exciting; in particular the chase through the tunnel under the US/Mexican border. Overall I'm sure fans of the previous films will enjoy this as will those looking for mindless action without any really offensive content.",Tweekums,2017-01-27,2017
4.0,In automatic transmission,"Exhausted and pretty much running on synthetic artistry, ""Fast & Furious"" not only drops its definite article from the title but also much of the natural car chase sequences and canny blithe in place of heavily computer-generated action set pieces and a palpably inappropriate seriousness. Returning director Justin Lin (from the third installment ""The Fast & The Furious: Tokyo Drift"") impersonally helms this fourth installment that reunites its original lead cast for more physics-defying engines, brain-dead logic, scantily clad bimbos, and foot worship for good measure.Not that its target audience would primarily look for it but there's a plot and it involves Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) who's out to avenge the murder of a loved one courtesy of a drug kingpin. This leads him to another reluctant team-up with undercover FBI agent Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) and once again they are thrust into hazardous street racing from downtown LA to Mexico, and the run-of-the-mill narrative more or less goes into auto-drive from here.Largely debilitating for this latest hot rod project is its cliché-ridden script that has not a meager of inventiveness or eagerness, a sentiment apparently shared by its actors who are simply going through the motions, specially Diesel who highlights ""Fast & Furious""' misplaced intentness by exhibiting a labored sensitivity despite the caricature machismo. And though everything that has kept the series going is here gratuitously put at disposal, which is to say loads of wheels and hot-looking females, as a whole it starts to feel repetitive - a redundant profit-oriented scheme that cannot be saved by the sporadic appearance of Jordana Brewster.",Jay_Exiomo,2009-04-02,2009
8.0,Back on track,"The best way to describe Fast & Furious would be as a guilty pleasure. There's nothing to lend weight to this film as a great work, an Oscar contender or a movie worthy of critical acclaim, but there something about this, as there was with the first, The Fast And The Furious, back in 2001.Rob Cohen has never been known for subtlety and his 2001 film was far from it, but even even though he had nothing to do with this, his stamp is well and truly on it. Fast & Furious is the fourth in this surprising successful franchise, and besides the fact that I liked the original in spite of the fact that I'm NOT a motor-head, I've avoided the intervening sequels, 2 fast, 2 Furious and Tokyo Drift, for one simple reason, besides the fact that just didn't fancy them.No Vin Diesel. I'm not suggesting that Vin is the greatest actor in the Hollywood, nor should be treading the boards of the Royal Shakespeare Company anytime soon, but his blockhead with a heart of gold persona works for me. He's likable and suits this role down to a tee, as does his dimwitted surfer dude sidekick, Paul Walker.Walker offers nothing significant to the film except for his relationship with Diesel. The pairing is enjoyable but little more, but isn't that the point of adrenalin films like this? This is about cars, women, cops and robbers, and great fun to boot. The tone of this movie is on par with Cohen's original and though I can't justifiably compare this to the sequels which I have never seen, I don't want too either. This is the sequel that 2 Fast should have been and I only hope that now they're back on track, that Fast & Furious 5 could be another romp worthy of a watch.It's nice to see a franchise go off track and find its feet again after so many years and it is a testament to the original cast who, though only have a limited range, have clearly breathed life back into the franchise.",nEoFILM,2011-04-19,2011
4.0,the weirdest thing is that I actually wanted to see this,"I have many problems with this, and have no idea where I am going to start. There is a) no plot. You watch it, and it is just car races and scenes. It's a boring film, with the only interesting scenes being with Vin Diesel and the car races. In fact, the cars didn't even interest me as the title aims to do. It is very dull and terribly underdone, with clichés and little character development. I did like the cast and the races, but I had many problems with this movie that I can't simply express. Midway through, I was falling asleep whilst thinking to myself 'the weirdest thing is that I actually wanted to see this!' My only advice is to skip this if you like something more than mindless plots and characters, and a film that tries so hard to be as 'sexy' as possible but ultimately falls flat, leaving you walking out disappointed and annoyed, or entertained as hell",suicidalicecreamtruckdriver,2009-06-29,2009
7.0,"It is back to the beginning, back to familiar faces and a surprisingly serious tone for the series.","It is back to the beginning, back to familiar faces and a surprisingly serious tone for the series. But we still get a stupid naming committee. Yeah, Fast and Furious isn't at all confusing when looking back at the series, is it the first, second, third film? Who knows! What's wrong calling it The Fast and the Furious 4?To make things more unnecessarily complicated, Fast and Furious is a prequel/sequel, taking place after the first film but before the third film (so it should technically be No.1.5) due to Sung Kang's character Han returning to the series. Whether it acknowledges the second film or not is ambiguous.When running from the law begins to get to him, Dominic (Vin Diesel) is looking for revenge after a drug dealer kills his partner Letty. At the same time, the FBI is looking for the same man, spearheading the operation is a reinstated Brian O'Conner. Naturally, the way they must infiltrate this heroin ring is through the dealer's love for performance car racing. I'm happy to see the return of the moodier tone; this feels like a direct sequel to the first film rather than a spin-off or a parody. A lot of the film is set at night with deep shadows. They even made Paul Walker's Brian O'Conner bearable! His character is rejected from the others since the first film and he starts out as more of an anti-hero lawman. I was quite surprised at the apparent restraint at glorifying the cars themselves; the camera seems to linger less over them as the film ploughes through its exposition and story. Of course that could just be me desensitized to it  I have watched four of these films now! It still has the usual trappings, don't worry.It is ultimately a solid story and a decent sequel to the first film, if you liked The Fast and the Furious you shouldn't have any problem with this. This does make the series more traditional (persistent narrative) which is a shame; the reason I enjoy Tokyo Drift so much was that it offered a new direction for the franchise, an anthology franchise about driving, following different characters each time. But that's not the way to make money, but as it stands, this is good too.",CinemaCocoa,2017-04-13,2017
6.0,Good,Overall rating 7.0: I think this movie sets the tone for the Fast and Furious movies after this. It's fun seeing most of the original cast back in this one. Some of the scenes drag a bit to me but for the most part it's interesting. The third act is pretty good with the tunnels is pretty cool. The films villain isn't bad as well but definitely isn't the best in the franchise. Overall I think the fourth outing is a good enough movie with some good action scenes.,twpain,2020-06-06,2020
6.0,Getting back on the right track,"The longer a franchise goes on, the more likely it seems to fall into one of two patterns. Lucky series continue to build on the strengths of their predecessors, adding to the good and removing the bad for an increasingly good experience. Unlucky series find something that works early on and stagnate, refusing to innovate for fear of losing their magic. Somehow, with Fast and Furious, the FF series straddles both of these patterns at the same time. Series' mainstay Brian O'Conner is back and is now a federal agent working to break up a cartel run smuggling ring in Los Angeles. However, when the same cartel kills Dominic Toretto's girlfriend Letty, Dom returns to his home turf and two reluctantly team-up to take down the bad guys.If that plot sounds familiar, there is a good reason, it is literally the plot of the first two movies sewn together. From the first you have Brian working undercover alongside Dom, the LA setting and the street races. From the second you have the bitter rivals forced to team up to bust up a drug operation. Despite the fact the the story takes zero steps forward narratively, the whole thing actually works. This is mostly because the series is starting to mature. Sure, the camera still clings to the rear-ends of half- naked women with a pubescent glee, but the dialogue is far superior to anything in the series so far, there is real character growth and the dramatic moments work more often then they don't. If you need an example, just take the scene in which Dom describes Letty to an interested cartel enforcer named Gisele, the scene is almost heart- breaking and is miles above anything found in the first three films.To match the stronger writing, the cast bring a better game as well. Paul Walker really hits his stride here, trading in his poor faux machismo for a more reserved, thinking attitude, giving room for Vin Diesel to handle the tough guy stuff. Both actors work great together and manage to sell the improved dialogue well. The action scenes still aren't amazing, but returning director Justin Lin steps his game up from Tokyo Drift and keeps things entertaining throughout, though the CGI has already started to age a few years out. The soundtrack is even a little better, still filled with loud and angry rap and rock, but better, less obnoxious song choices then entries past. The only thing not improved in the slightest is the villain, who is just another one-dimensional drug kingpin, seemingly the archenemies of good, honest street racers the world over. Fast and Furious may have lost the ""the""s from the title, but is has gained some quality to its filmmaking and for the first time I can see why this series was able to become a tent-pole franchise. Here's hoping that as the next entry sheds more words from its title, it gains even more high caliber filmmaking.",ryanskywalker-87402,2017-04-15,2017
7.0,Tunnel vision across underground jurisdictions infiltration of a truth of enemy creating bonds of knowledge,"In this one. Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, Paul Walker as Brian O'Connor, Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto and Michelle Rodriguez as Leticia ''Letty'' Ortiz. The film also introduces new characters Fenix (Laz Alonso), Omar (Don Omar), Leo Tego (Tego Calderon), Cara Mirtha (Mirtha Michelle) and Campos (John Ortiz). Sung Kang who played Han Seoul-Oh in Tokyo Drift has also made a appearance. We can briefly say that this is the direct sequel to the 2001 film. It begins from where it ended. Brian is at it again he a cop not cop now cop trying tobring down a heroin importer by infiltrating his operation. Director:Justin Lin has done a better thriller We start in Honduras were dom is doing his business robbing a oil tanker with letti But thing go explosive bad So with Brian on the hunt and sniffing round he comes in contact with dom So when Brian gets wind of a job he goes on a hunch to a party finding clues As dom also has grief on his mind he is also on the hunt for a killer but his has him and Brian unite for shared enemy and they are forced to bring him down any way necessary so with La race on the cards for to get a job the two work on a plan even though they don't trust each other so not give away who each other is. Gal gadot this is her first film her character Giselle is a henchwomen for bragga And with honour at stake their is a race but this part is like video game as its goes kind GPS virtual race Bragga his gang try and manipulate certain situations to stay ahead The film focuses mostly on swag, sex appeal, action, hunt and most importantly on the American Muscle cars. Why the film holds my attention is because the film promises on what is says in it's title: Fast & Furious. It's definitely more fast and more furious than the original one. Los Angeles and floors through the Mexican desert. When a crime brings them back to L.A., fugitive ex-con Dom Toretto reignites his feud with agent Brian, Dom and Brian must give in to an uncertain new trust if they hope to outmaneuver him. And from convoy heists to precision stealth tunnels crawls across international lines with close contact racing accidents , two men will find the best way to get revenge: push the their limits and cars they have What a film from start to finish this is the making of the this film series you don't get many film getting better as they get older but this made but my on the seat for every other fast film enjoy the film because I did and the cars I listed out this film rating as you see is 7 and its rating is going up for the rest The Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 that O'Connor 1964 Chevrolet Impala 1769. 1967 Chevrolet C-Series. 1969 Chevrolet Camaro Z28. 1969 Dodge Coronet. 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS. 1970 Dodge Charger. 1970 Plymouth Road Runner. 1971 Cadillac Sedan DeVille.",lark40,2020-05-05,2020
8.0,My fav of the series,"This movie had in from first moment, I loved the start of Second movie but the start this incredible. The effect in that scenes were mind blowing and some very intense moment and already had me on the edge of seat Brian O'Conner, now working for the FBI in LA, teams up with Dominic Toretto to bring down a heroin importer by infiltrating his operation, While Dominic not in nice place as His girlfriends died in a race Someone was blame and it will hurt get rid of anyone that gets in is way and he is also on run from the police well. I found this one ever more enjoyable then first 2 in the movie, I did skip 3rd one as I going watch that after number Fast 6 or 7 , it won't be soon lol The way they ending the movie, WFT , NOO!, Don't end there! 8 out of 10 great movie",atinder,2013-07-24,2013
6.0,Slow and Steady,"Bringing the entire cast together for the first time, Fast & Furious begins to shape out the iconic franchise. The story is not the most interesting and with unexplained circumstances, it begins to lose the realistic feel of the previous installments. The twists feel very predictable and there are quite a few points where the story begins to get boring. Redeeming that as best as possible, the cast all do a charming job, as you can tell that they have fun and enjoy working together. Fast & Furious is the first installment in the franchise to give the feeling of family, but fails to capture anything special outside of that.",Ltufano23,2023-11-02,2023
5.0,"This installment (like the others) will definitely be well received amongst its legions of eager, young fans, but not so much in respect to casual film goers.","The latest installment in the adrenaline fuelled The Fast and the Furious franchise, Fast and Furious is quite possibly the weakest of the quadrilogy, but it does manage to dish up in fairly decent portions what made the first three films such a hit with younger viewers. So in a sense this installment like the others will definitely be well received amongst its legions of eager, young fans. If that's all you want to know- stop reading. If you are a more casual film goers, I urge you to read on. Now of all the ‘Fast and the Furious’ films the only one I actually enjoyed was the first in the series. So really I was not expecting much when viewing the film, but I expected better than what I saw. Fast and Furious is not a sequel nor is it a prequel, it is an interquel (a film set between two films in a series), in this case it takes place between ‘2 Fast 2 Furious’ and ‘The fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift’. Within minutes we are reintroduced with familiar faces; Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), but we are also introduced with what now seems to be the ‘cancer’ for films- excess CGI. This CGI replaces traditional actual car crashes and replaces them with pathetic CGI representations. One particular atrocious scene involves a bouncing flaming tanker rolling down a steep road towards Dominic and Letty. They avoid the flaming death trap in a ridiculous way, but let's get into that later. Now this sub-par effect is caused by Dom, Letty and others attempting to steal a very large petrol tanker. Predictability sets in and the tanker crashes and one of the large tanks of petrol it was moving rolls down a large decline towards Dom and Letty, who are enclosed on the road on three of the four sides. To the left there is the flaming remains of a crashed tanker cab, and to their left a rock wall and behind them a cliff. They have no choice but to speed towards the bouncing tank and drive under it. Normally this would be a moment of tension, but it's not as the audience is aware that they will come out of it alive and well, I mean it stars Vin Diesel they wouldn't kill him of in the first couple minutes would they? I've wasted enough time on this scene, I had better move on. The heat comes down on Dom and his crew after the hijacking and they are forced to flee. One of his crew Chan, who fans should remember from Tokyo Drift decides to go to Japan, while Dom decides to move to Panama. In Panama Don is alerted via a phone call that a friend (who I will not reveal) has been murdered in the USA. In a vengeful rage Dom travels to the states to pursue the murder. The Murder turns out to be a drug lord Arturo Braga. Coincidently this is the same criminal who a now FBI agent Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is after. Dom and Brian initially infiltrate the organisation that traffics drugs from Mexico into the US, by loading them into cars and making them zip through an underground mine at the US/ Mexico border. Now keep in mind this section of the border is heavily monitored, in addition to the mine being relatively dangerous to navigate at high speeds. So why a drug dealer would risk millions of dollars of drugs, by trafficking them in the most stupid way I have ever heard of is beyond me. Perhaps they just wanted an excuse to show off some close-ups of cars and Paul Walkers hand on a gear stick. As Dom and Brian's time together increase they become friendlier towards each other, similar to how they were through the majority of The Fast and the Furious. Now I was glad to see this relationship develop in the movie, but was disappointed at the way it was handled. I would have preferred it if Dom was more hostel towards Brian in the beginning than he was in the film, as a far better sense of drama could have been generated. This would have attracted some praise from viewers looking for something more than any of the other movies in the series offered, without affecting fan enjoyment. Overall enjoyment of this movie would be limited only to those who are fans of the first three movies. If a fan of those sees it I can almost guarantee that they will enjoy it. Other audiences will probably not feel the same way leaving the cinema, instead they will probably notice the absurdity of the plot, its poor effects as well as its often flat acting (from Diesel in particular). Hence Fast and Furious receives a 4/10 from me, and I am being quite generous as I think it is still able to appeal to its age group.",BigBirdtheBum,2009-04-28,2009
8.0,Is this one the best one yet?,"This was a good movie. They were able to bring back all the things that made the first one great like Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, and Paul Walker, and let go of the things that did not work so well. All the things that you loved in the first one are here and a little more. Vin Diesel does a great job from start to finish. In parts of the movie it almost makes you want to leave your seat and cheer. For all you Paul Walker haters out there he did a good job as well. He is like a backup quarterback in the NFL you want him to manage the game don't try to do to much just do what is takes to win. Walker is not the star of the movie, but behind the star he manages his part well. He does a good job of playing his part and not going beyond that and try to make a great performance. Walker acts within his ability. I for one am not a Walker hater so I never felt like he did a bad job, but I know there are a lot of you out there and you will be happy with his performance in this movie. Just the right blind of action and cars. For all the people that loved Han from Tokyo Drift don't get really excited, his role is only for about 3 minutes at the beginning of the movie. This is not a movie that is going to win any Academy Awards, but it is a movie that will keep you entertain for an hour and forty five minutes. Worth the movie to pay to see this one in the theater. Which is saying a lot for the way the economy is right now. It is the best one in the series.",blake-brown20,2009-04-03,2009
6.0,Effectively restarts the franchise with modern action and a focus on character,"Vin Diesel and Paul Walker made one ""The Fast and the Furious"" movie together, a movie that was debatably decent – at best – back in 2001. Eight years (and two other ""Fast and Furious"" movies) later, Universal Pictures decides a reunion is in order, and whether that decision came out of a genius inkling or total desperation, it worked – to the tune of an April box office record and the restart of a movie franchise that was always meant to be.""Fast & Furious"" doesn't give this series a facelift (a new paint body/paint job? I'm not good with car metaphors), but time has worked in its favor. Director Justin Lin (spin-off ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"") definitely has a more modern sense of style that makes this movie feel made in another era compared to the original ""Fast and the Furious"" and ""2 Fast 2 Furious,"" which definitely show their age. Part of this is thanks to improvements in CGI and green screen technology, but Lin also employs a grittier, hand-held approach. From the first few minutes of the film, which shows Dominic Toretto (Diesel), girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and the rest of their gang trying to hijack a tank truck in the Dominican Republic, it's clear that visually speaking, ""Fast & Furious"" has greatly improved over its predecessors. In terms of the story – that's another matter.The same situations and plot schematics from previous films unsurprisingly show up in ""Fast & Furious."" O'Conner is working for the feds again causing his superiors' headaches and he and Toretto are again placed at odds with each other as they're after the same Mexican drug lord, albeit with different tactics in mind. They even must race each other to get in with the bad guy. All this is to be expected, however, given the ""reunion"" aspect of the story. Plenty of dialogue tilts toward a reminiscing vibe in hopes of conjuring up fond memories for people who loved the original. The film thinks and acts as though it's building on that movie's ""legacy,"" but the reality is that it's trying to erase the previous two films a bit and fix its own trajectory. Fortunately, it does, though not nearly as well as it thinks it has.Writer Chris Morgan – also brought over after his work on ""Tokyo Drift"" – demonstrates a sound understanding of what made the first movie good, and that's the Dom-Brian relationship. He constructs a new up-and- down journey for the two of them, much of which hinges on past feelings. Morgan devotes the downtime of the script to this relationship. It goes beneath the surface, which the first films (and especially ""2 Fast 2 Furious"") failed to do. Quick scenes of a brooding Diesel as Dom reflects on the anti-climactic loss of Letty (the news is just dropped in as exposition) don't generate an emotional response, and you can guess exactly what O'Conner will say as he tells Mia (Jordana Brewster) why he let Dom go in the first film, but these moments, cliché as they are, do help endear us to the characters a little more. More important than anything, the superficial MTV Spring Break vibe has dissipated (aside from one party scene early on and a little too much Pitbull music). The film is far more respectful of its female characters, even if there aren't enough of them in important roles. Mia is not an important role – she's the men's emotional sounding board.Of course, the action is still the most important part of these films, and Lin brings the kinetic energy that keeps ""Fast & Furious"" engaging. He does employ some of the same race and chase sequence techniques (the CGI view inside the engine sadly returns) that previous directors employed in their films (showing the speedometer, gear shifts, feet moving on pedals, etc.) but it's a little smoother and delivers more mouth-agape moments. Unfortunately, the climactic tunnel chase is dark, computer-heavy and a little disappointing on the whole.Putting all details aside, ""Fast & Furious"" achieves what was undoubtedly the most critical objective for its producers and Universal: get this once-promising franchise back on track. It does all the dirty work necessary to get its main characters back together and on the same page so that future films can take them in potentially exciting new directions.~Steven CThanks for reading!

3.0,Slow and Plodding!,"Really, Fast & Furious is plain misleading, the title should have been Slow n Plodding. What an absolute drag.Exhibit A - Directionless director. With random hand-held camera, incredibly jerky footage, fast cuts all over, you never really get to see anything good. Of the cars at least. The races seemed like they were directed by Michael Bay. Every thing kept exploding and crashing. It was horrible!Exhibit B - Dom's double chin. Humungous, monstrous double chin. Bigger than his bald head. A mutant double chin. His evil doppleganger, even. Sure, I'm being superficial here, but it's a movie, and your job is to look good. Dom is tough muscle-head. A double chin just looks plain ugly!Exhibit C - The story. I think there was one, but I could be wrong.What was real good to see on the screen was some very nice mid-riff closeups of Michelle Rodriguez. Plus that other skank who shows up halfway through the movie, falls for Dom, and thrusts her real hard nipples towards him. He still turns her down. Go figure.",bottleHeD,2009-04-04,2009
7.0,The original cast returns for another spin.,"Fast & Furious is no masterpiece of subtlety and drama, but it is pretty entertaining. Especially if you like hot cars and hot, scantily clad women. I really can't tell you how much the story has in common with that of the previous movies (I honestly don't remember the stories of any of these movies a week after seeing them), but who really watches these for the story. There's something about Dom (Vin Diesel) looking for revenge and Brian (Paul Walker) trying totaled down some drug importer. Obviously, both those things involve lots of cool cars racing around (the parts that I do end up remembering). That's where the movie shines, even though there aren't quite enough of them. The car scenes are genuinely exciting, with director Justin Lin having a great eye for capturing that kind of action. All in all, this is a slick action movie that more than lives up to the Fast & Furious name. If you liked the others, you like this one too.",lewiskendell,2011-10-07,2011
7.0,Mediorce At Times But Always Entertaining,"When a crime brings them back to L.A., fugitive ex-con Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) reignites his feud with agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker). But as they are forced to confront a shared enemy, Dom and Brian must give in to an uncertain new trust if they hope to outmanuever him. And from convoy heists to precision tunnel crawls across international lines, two men will find the best way to get revenge: push the limits of what's possible behind the wheel.

6.0,Same formula,"Comparing the original, I would say this sequel falls short of expectation. The storyline is very cliché and it is very predictive. Its the same tried and tested formula, similar to the 1st two movies. I don't see the Fast and Furious series movie this way. Tokyo Drift brought something different to the table, which I've to give Justin Lin the credit for it. This movie however goes back to the preview plot outlines of 1 and 2. Vin and Paul don't bring conviction in their roles, which I feel they probably opted for this movie for the sake of it.On the whole its popcorn fun. You get to see fast cars, hot chicks and good action sequences.I rate it 6/10",vishr,2009-04-03,2009
7.0,a standard fast and furious movie with less cars,"I have watched all the fast and furious movies. This movie is, I think, no better or worse than the other movies of the series. The good thing about the movie is, Vin Diesel acts in it. The bad (or worse) thing is that the movie is such a big cliché. When some character says something, you can just guess what the other character will give as a reply. When we see letty in the first place, we just guess that she will die and dom will run after some revenge. The movie is very expectable from the beginning to the end. Another bad thing is that there are less cars and less workshop scenes than the other fast and furious films. Also, the supporting characters aren't as eccentric as they were on the other movies. The tunnel scenes were really good, which seem to have given some difficulty to the effects people and to the stuntmen. Overall, this movie is just your standard fast and furious movie, no more no less. Just the movie to ask for if you like Vin Diesel, girls kissin', modified cars and some action scenes.",dogankurban,2009-05-05,2009
6.0,Again,"Before i write anything about the movie the reason they make sequels is for money especially this one since they brought back the original cast. If you like the fast and the furious saga then definitely this is a must see, they brought back the two hottest stars of the saga for the sequel. The plot like usual isn't what captures the viewers attention, its always the cars and hot girls. They reunited Vin Diesel and Paul Walker which is great but we don't want to see the same cars again. Nissan Skyline is a great tuner vehicle but we've seen it before same goes for the American muscle. This one has similarities like the first movie of the series which is the drama scenes which were a lot more than the action sequences. The action sequences done in the car were eye catching but the chase done on feet was unrealistic and brutal, even the first action scene where Diesel drives under the gasoline truck was plain ‘stupid’. The first one was about the tuned up cars and the storybetween Paul walker and Vin diesel, 2nd one was about crime and alittle action, third one was fully about drifting, and now they reunited the hottest stars of the saga to recreate the magic of the trilogy. It has everything except the ‘magic’,it relvoves around the death of Michelle Rodriguez which is already a downfall since she is proabaly the best girl for the job. The critics have bashed this movie, some critics say it's 8thgrader vocabulary used in the script, but lets be straight forward we don't watch movies like this for stories or the never ending drama, if we wanted watch movies like that we'll only watch Oscar nominated movies. Action flicks like these are enjoyed by viewers, scenes that capture your attention and blow you away, making the impossible stunts possible. From what i heard there is a 5th installment which is good news for people who love cars from American muscle to tuned up skyline's. I am excited about the 5th version only if Micheal bay could direct the movie it will certainly have extraordinary chase sequences.If you liked the first three then it's worth a look, don't get overly manipulated by the critics and watch it for entertainment value and don't expect the story to be creative. I wouldn't rate this movie out of 10 but it deserves a 6 just for the fact many scenes could have been improved maybe they cut back on the budget but it's worth viewing it at the big screen.",babu_145,2009-04-03,2009
8.0,Best of Franchise,"Contrary to conventional wisdom, many sequels are superior to their originals (THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and WRATH OF KHAN come immediately to mind). However, I cannot recall when the FOURTH film in a franchise was superior to all the others, including the original. However, what else can one say about a movie that: o covers its production costs in its first WEEK o has action sequences rivaling anything in the BORNE, BOND, STAR WARS or INDIANA JONES franchises o Reunites its original cast and improves upon their relationshipsFAST & FURIOUS does all this. Plus it has has fast cars, hot women, great music, outstanding photography, Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez. It even moves better than AVATAR. WOW!I give FAST & FURIOUS an 8",Bob-45,2010-09-23,2010
6.0,More fun with horsepower,"This fourth entry in the tough-guy, street-racer, busty-babe franchise is, and is not, worthy of the first. It's brought back the original actors, and they still look good. It's got at least one of the original street races. But now, as the opening sequence shows, it's joined the blockbuster rush and shifted over into a CGI-world of preposterously extravagant video-game car events. This intro is like the overkill prelude of 'Quantum of Solace.' Both movies show a trend toward numbing their audiences out with speed and violence in the opening shots, instead of quietly warming them up. It's not a good strategy. 'Fast & Furious' is replete with action that's neither credible nor as integral to the plot as it ought to be, or as the action was in the first in the series, Rob Cohen's 'The Fast and the Furious' (2001), which itself was a glossier reimagining of the kind of cheapie Fifties and Sixties fast-car movies Tarantino plays with in 'Death Proof.' But this one's still got tough guys and busty babes. It's got colorful muscle cars for hot-rodders to drool over. And it's got bright, clear images that are often beautiful. Though they don't quite offset the choppy editing, they punctuate it in an esthetically pleasing way.In the first film Dom (Vin Diesel) disappeared into Mexico. Diesel missed the second episode, seemingly holding out for better career opportunities that didn't quite materialize. His big star vehicle, the 2002 'xXx,' was a bust, despite the presence of B-picture diva Asia Argento. He did star in Sidney Lumet's quirky trial drama, 'Find Me Guilty', if anybody remembers. Having reappeared in episode three, Tokyo Drift (like this directed by Justin Lin), Dom's now living in the Dominican Republic with his girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez). (Note for devotees: in time this new movie fits between episodes three and four.) It's Dom and Letty in the opening frames, stealing a multiple-unit truckload of oil. But their trickery defies the laws of physics and human dexterity too much to matter, even if it weren't too soon to get our adrenalin to pump that hard. Vin's still as muscled and macho; he was lumpen before; now he's just a little thicker. So is his delivery of dialogue, which now has an extra half-second delay. But there's something that makes it hard not to like Vin.Paul Walker (as Brian O'Connor) is similarly likable, with a prettier face. He doesn't have the bottle-blond golden boy look of the original 'The Fast and the Furious,' but he still has a square-jawed, sterling quality mingled with toughness that suits his role here as, now, a cop who turns rogue (or a rogue turned cop; he's not sure) aiming to serve higher ends--but unwilling to betray his old street-racing, law-breaking buddies. He aims to catch a drug kingpin his police boss seems content to let by, but he's forever loyal to Dom.Walker, like Diesel, has star quality, though he too has not exactly had a blockbuster career. He did, however, star in the mind-bendingly over-the-top action flick 'Running Scared,' and got to play the martyred Marine platoon leader in Eastwood's 'Flags of Our Fathers.' Though the plot of 'Fast & Furious' may not always serve Walker and Diesel as well as it should, there's an authenticity about their line delivery still that puts across the myth of their camaraderie and loyalty to a code that Dom has, and Brian is still working on.At least the movie has the sense to make the opening hijack attempt a failure. It leads Dom to go and hide out in L.A. with his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster), who used to be Brian's girlfriend. That flame, predictably, is easily reignited when the plot needs a romantic boost.In the street race sequence, Dom has a GPS screen with a woman's soothing voice (that of Gal Gadot, an exotic new addition to the femmes list) to show the big boy and us where he is in his trajectory. This shows the influence of Paul WS Anderson's 'Death Race,' which took the car race genre up a notch. Alas, though, the slick technology takes us further away from the personal, homemade quality of street racing, which in the first episode was about horsepower and garage work and macho taunts, not visual stunts and hi tech screens. Despite all the crashes (more often head-over-heels than in real life) these movies make racing on the roads look safer than it should, which is why this movie has a detailed ""DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME"" disclaimer at the end. (And there is stunt driving in this movie, even though it's undercut by the CGI tricks.) You'd better believe that warning. Better not to drive at top speed into a half-shut Mexican mountain tunnel. And don't try catching a guy your pal has just dropped out a window, either.It remains to be seen if this movie, which is still fun and fast, helps Diesel and Walker on to the star rules they may deserve, or, what seems equally possible, just sidetracks them further. Lovers of the franchise are not going to be howling with disappointment, but new converts at this stage seem unlikely.",Chris Knipp,2009-04-04,2009
4.0,more cars less fun,"I would never call A fast and the furious film good cinema. But then again its not trying to be, its simply A hot rod movie. That means that it doesn't need a plot or good acting. What it does need however are A hand full of ingredients. Fast cars,beautiful women,lots of driving stunts,and an experience that leaves the viewer entertained if not a little dumber. The original The fast and the furious is a case in point example. however the seres took a turn for the worse when they tried to introduce plot to the films. plots just don't work for a car movie. But then the savior of the seres arrives. Number 4 finally we have Paul Walker and Vin Diesel teamed up again. The ubber cute Jordana Brewster is also back. So how did it fair? well lets break it down. first the cars, There was a decent collection. there was another Skyline,A ford torino,a nice Bmw,and of coarse the 1970 Chevell common maybe but I was happy to see it because that is what I drive. then there was a the collection of oddball cars like the Gnx the camaro called the bomb and a few enthusiasts may have noticed the lamborghini suv. but for all the cars none of them really had an impact on me. who can forget Doms Rx7 or the bright orange Supra from the first film they where the stars of the film along with there costars the jetta and the charger which made a reappearance in this film but just didn't seem to be the same. second the girls, there where some nice looking girls thru out as id mentioned earlier jordana from the earlier film is back and she alone is worth the watch so really no problems in that area. how about the fun car stunts. this is a place that i had few issues. one there was not very many race scenes mostly just some oddball driving blips scattered thruout and those where covered in so much CGI i couldn't even enjoy them. last this movie took its self a little to serious its a car movie not a crime drama. and lets face it Vin Diesel and Paul Walker both offer big screen presence but are nether one what i would call good at acting. So don't try and make them act by trying to show an emotional side. To sum up i wish that the series would go back in time all the way to the year of its birth 2001 and make a carbon copy of itself only then could i finally say that the series is fun again.",thestig1,2009-04-12,2009
8.0,"Takes The Fhranchise Back To Where It Belongs,","Fast And Furious is a great movie with a well developed storyline that takes the Fast and the Furious franchise back to where it belongs.They clearly realize that these movies are better off with the same people,in the second one it was only Paul Walker with a main role and in the third the cast is completely different.I found this one much better,even better than the first in my opinion,it seems more mature and focuses more on a good story rather than just good car chases,don't worry though,there's plenty of time for that as well.Clearly the Fast and Furious movies can only continue with Vin Diesel and Paul Walker,and from this one forward they realize that,and the fifth only improves.Fans of the first Fast and Furious will be very pleased with this installment.Brian O'Connor is back working with the FBI in LA and reunites with Dominic to investigate a murder.",lesleyharris30,2013-06-17,2013
6.0,Packed with action but little sense,"This movie starts off with a great sequence - an outrageous, but hugely enjoyable combination of driving, stunt work and special effects, and then goes - well, I'm not quite sure where. There is a story - it's a bit muddled, and told in a way which is a bit muddled. There appear to be things which people do with no clear explanation of why. And all of it takes place at high speed and excruciatingly loud volume. I confess that I've only seen isolated bits of the earlier movies, and I wouldn't know a trans-am from Pan-Am, so maybe I'm not the target demographic. But I like Vin Diesel and Paul Walker and, while I don't have much time for Michelle Rodriguez, I have LOTS of time for Jordana Brewster (or, at least, I would have given the opportunity), so I quite liked this movie despite the fact it doesn't make as much sense as it ought to (and it didn't ought to make much!).",neil-476,2009-05-07,2009
5.0,Street racing with a vengeance,"Some say this is a good sequel but I am going to have to disagree, yeah it does have some okay race scenes. But it just wasn't exciting and the plot didn't even make the races all that interesting to watch. It just seemed like the makers wanted to cash in quick by showing elements that most guys would be into. Which is fine, but besides that nothing about this movie gets the attention. Yeah Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are back in this but the way they go about accomplishing races and other task just didn't get my attention and there is little to no tension during the races. I didn't even particularly find a lot of the action in this movie to be all that exciting or entertaining for that matter, although the stunts were pretty good. It seemed like this movie depended on two actors coming together and didn't put much thought into the plot. The plot tries to go serious, well sort of compared to he other movies in this franchise but it just didn't work. The vengeance direction of this movie wasn't effective and didn't lead to caring about any of the race nor was there any tension. Very forgetful plot and nothing really stands out, however the 4 main car sequences was alright with the stunt sequences as well.5/10",KineticSeoul,2011-04-30,2011
7.0,a great addition to the nothing special genre,"Brian O'Conner is now a federal agent (?) and drawn back into his past when he's unexpectedly reunited with former prey Dominic Toretto (Diesel) while in pursuit of an infamous drug smuggler, the very same smuggler with whom Toretto has his very own personal score to settle. Despite the circumstances, and their prior history, the two reluctantly decide to work together to bring the lowlife down. Silly, clichéd sequel has the expected high-octane action sequences, but suffers from shallow characters, crummy dialogue, weak acting, and a ridiculous story. The reunion of stars Diesel and Walker who kick-started the franchise adds no flare whatsoever to the tepid proceedings, but undiscriminating action fans may not mind. *½",Special-K88,2009-04-06,2009

7.0,For those who know nothing about cars.,"When street-racer Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is murdered by a member of the Braga drug cartel, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) teams up with FBI agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) to bring those responsible to justice.Fast & Furious, the inventively titled fourth film in the popular Fast and Furious franchise, delivers more pedal to the metal, full-throttle, high-octane thrills and spills. But where the series was originally little more than 'car-porn' geared towards young petrol-heads and custom car fans, this entry takes a slightly different route, the action more accessible to those who, like me, drive a very sensible family hatchback with zero street cred and nothing under the hood, but who still enjoy slick, undemanding popcorn blockbuster fun.With a plot that offers broader appeal, Vin Diesel back in the driving seat, accompanied by Walker, Rodriguez, and Jordana Brewster as his sexy younger sister, and an early role for Gal 'Wonder Woman' Gadot, part four is the most enjoyable Fast & Furious so far.",BA_Harrison,2018-07-21,2018
6.0,Back together,"That the actors had fun making the movie (maybe apart from Michelle Rodriguez, more on that, maybe on her Myspace site), is pretty obvious. And the movie feels light and fun too. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker reprise their roles from the first Fast & Furious movie. Also two women come back to this film, although it's pretty clear that the boys are the ""driving power"" behind the concept/movie (and yes pun very much intended).The story isn't something special and you should really try to shut your brain and enjoy the ""ride"" (again pun intended), because the stunts are really good again. I think this should be a nice closure to the whole franchise, but let's see what the producers say/think. You can only hope that Mr. Diesel get's back on his feet and reprises his ""Pitch Black"" character (Riddick) or get's another role like in the movie ""Find me guilty"" (this time hopefully people will notice).",kosmasp,2009-08-11,2009
7.0,"Thumbs up for Laz Alonzo, but ya gotta show more of the ladies!","Okay world, we have a new bad guy, a new nemesis, a new Hollywood heavy, Fenix Rise played by Laz Alonzo. Although billed as a supporting cast member, Mr. Alonzo carries this movie. He saves this otherwise routine action movie from cinematic complacency. The movie has a flimsy story, a ridiculous plot, and good if not exceptional acting from the two leads. Vin Diesel is always wonderful, but he's not the same great character from the original. However, the beautiful Jordana Brewster gives a credible performance but the incredible Michelle Rodriguez is practically no where to be found, which further weakens the movie. Why Ms. Rodriguez is given so little play is puzzling and her absence lowers the temperature of this movie by several degrees. Actresses like Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster are meant to be seen and admired, so, Hollywood, please showcase them because they are wonderful ... and hot.",PWNYCNY,2009-04-04,2009
8.0,Strong sequel in a great movie series!,"Fast & Furious shows originality far beyond it's title, enough to put it on top of the series with the first. 2F2F was a decent sequel, but definitely was not an ending point. TD was funny, entertaining, and gripping, but once again was not a good ending point for the series. F&F was a GREAT addition to the series. Enough girls, plenty of fast cars, some good one-liners, good action, awesome driving, great stunts, and an awesome cast. This one had more than enough badass-ery to satisfy me. Overall, I went in expecting something like TD, but came out amazed. Any fan of the series will absolutely love F&F! Some gripes: 1) I was disappointed Han didn't have more of a role, I really liked his style in Tokyo Drift. 2) The GPS-Nav thing added nothing to the movie, it was just some stupid Hollywood cheese that had wayyy too much of a part in the movie. 3) During the race-in, Brian was driving parallel to Dom on the dirt road, then at the end of the road he drove down the embankment to catch up with Dom.... WTF?!??!?! That was a PRIME moment to do an epic jump. 4) I thought Lil Wayne had a cameo.....",Bigbadboy701,2009-04-06,2009
6.0,Fast And Furious A Flawed But Decent Action Film,"Fast and Furious is a flawed but decent action film. Director Justin Lin is admirable for giving audiences plenty of action/car races but the lack of some character development and over the top moments weigh it down. However this movie wasn't the disaster I thought it would be and if you're a big fan of the original you'll probably enjoy this one just as much. I'd say this one is on par with the original which had it's flaws as well. Vin Disiel reprises the role of tough fugitive Dominic Toretto and Paul Walker returns too as undercover FBI Agent Brian O'Connor. Disiel and Walker are decent as the leads turning in good performances whose characters join forces once again to take down a common enemy after the death of someone close to Dom. Jordana Brewster also reprises the role of Dom's sister Mia and she does an all right job in her very limited screen time but she isn't given much to do. The rest of the cast are okay in their extended appearances. Michelle Rodriguez returns for a brief appearance as Dom's girlfriend Letty but her role in the film is cut really short. She still turns in a decent performance though. The action, fist fights, and car races are well executed and the same can go for the way they're shot because there's not a lot of shaky camera movements so you can usually make out whats going on. Some of the action/chases do go over the top but I'm willing to suspend my disbelief because this is a movie about illegal street racing after all. The story was okay but some characters lacked development but hey I wasn't exactly expecting anything Oscar worthy stuff from this film. No offense. The dialogue wasn't the best occasionally either but the attempt by the lead actors and some of the action/chase sequences made up for it. This fourth film in the Fast and the Furious series really isn't that bad at least not me it just could've been a little better. Overall Fast and the Furious has plenty of action, car chases/races/crashes, some surprises, and solid performances by the lead actors. This film is sure to please almost any die hard fan of the original. With it's obvious flaws aside this movie was better than expected.",tburke85,2009-08-03,2009
5.0,I have rarely felt so few emotions while watching a movie,"Fast and Furious = 5/10Fast and Furious is a kind of new beginning for the film series and now focuses more on a gangster plot than on pure racing, which the film only implements so mediocrely.Vin Diesel, as the face of the franchise, plays emotionless as always, but has a good dynamic with Paul Walker. The remaining characters are not worth mentioning as they have no charm or good dialogue.The plot is average. Dom tries to find his girlfriend's murderer and the film always tries to include action scenes with cars in order to find an argument why the film is set in the Fast and Furious franchise.The car action, especially the first part of the film, is sometimes really fun and exciting, but suffers from too hectic editing and poorly directed camera work.So this film sinks into absolute mediocrity, it's not incredibly bad but it's definitely not good either. The characters are too poorly written, the plot is too thin and the car scenes are surprisingly poorly done, even if they are fun to watch.It's hard to say anything at all about this film because it hardly triggers any emotions, it's not special in any way.But the film takes a new direction and delivers some fast-paced car scenes.",alexanderpratl,2024-09-15,2024

It just so happens that Agent Brian O'Connor is on the case and the two collide....Trying to bring Bragga to justice without killing each other. This isn't an Oscar contender so the acting can be ignored, as the cars, girls and cars...make up for practically all its faults. This film is more emotional than its predecessors as it tries to show a softer side of Dominic and reveal how life is for Dominic's sister Mia. The race scene at the end is definitely worth the wait but I especially enjoyed the 'Qualifying race'...Only the Fast and Furious crew can create great race scenes like this...

6.0,Very Fast Very Furious,"It should have been called ‘The Fast and The Furious - The Dark Tunnels’ or ‘The Fast and The Furious - The Traffic Re-Routers;  Drifting was a big event in FF3 which is a pie cake for everyone in this installation. If you compare all releases on Fast and Furious, the 1st Installation still rocks! Then after that comes FF4, then Tokyo Drift and the least exciting was the second part. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) crazily kept on changing his mind which route to take while driving. He did this all the time in the movie. If he reached a dead-end, he quickly routed his car to a new path. Amazing ! The only thing which I think had potential was when they come to rescue Vin Diesel in the end. The writers could have kept it for the next installation along with a fast-on-feet, jailbreak chase sequence. Very few street races, Amazing Direction, very few scenes for Michelle (Laticia/Letty). I feel a bit cheated because I expected to watch Jordana Brewster (Mia) who had not many scenes in the movie. Definitely a good watch!",quaker-9,2009-04-04,2009

6.0,Too serious.......,"I got a chance to see the new ""Fast & Furious"" movie this weekend. I gotta say I was expecting a huge blockbuster movie filled with fun and action much like its predecessors. Unfortunately I may have set the bar too high as I was thoroughly disappointed. I have been a huge fan of the ""Fast & Furious"" series for years as they are great for the purpose they were made for: To entertain. I felt that this newest installment took it self a bit too seriously and that it could have used a lot more ""fun"". The feel of the movie was a bit awkward as the cast has not worked together in almost 8 years. It was as if they were uncomfortable coming together again. What I also did not understand is where part 2 fit into this whole equation. It was as if the producers dusted off part 2 as if it never existed. I did like how they linked this movie to part 3(Tokyo Drift) however, as it is my favorite in the series. Overall I would have to give this movie a 6/10. It would probably be lower if I was not a fan of the series and actually cared to see what has happened with it's characters.",xjeffreyxnothing-1,2009-04-07,2009
6.0,How this could be Faster and Furiouser . . .,"First of all, once through the border tunnel--apparently the longest in North America--is enough. Doing it twice just emphasizes how much the tunnel decor is ripped off from the Indiana Jones movies. Secondly, move along the action at the beginning faster, so viewers will not have time to realize the machinery the gas bandits are destroying far exceeds the value of the petrol--oops, this whole thing about the most valuable tankers in world history has me talking like Mad Max! Thirdly, Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner just isn't furious enough. He looks like the sort of undercover cop they'd have in HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL--which is bad, since this is supposedly a much tougher crowd! If Walker owns a piece of the franchise which requires his continuing presence, at least make him sing every 20 minutes or so!",charlytully,2009-04-22,2009
7.0,"Absolutely thrilling, almost as good as the original","The ""Fast & the Furious"" franchise has gone through a downward spiral since the original was released in 2001. This original, ""The Fast and the Furious,"" combined both great car scenes and action sequences with a solid and interesting story. From there, ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" (2003) was made solely into a brainless action flick, and ""Tokyo Drift"" (2006) had very little going for it at all other than some good-looking cars. When news came out that ""Fast & Furious"" (2009) would be released with the original cast, but with the director of ""Tokyo Drift,"" the worst of the franchise, I was uncertain how it would do. Luckily it succeeded.While the story is a bit convoluted due to some poor storytelling and explanation, it, like the original, works on the levels of an interesting story and a thrilling action flick. The acting, as expected by the cast, works for the film. They clearly won't be receiving any Oscar noms any time soon, but for ""Fast & Furious,"" they work.The action sequences, though the CGI looks a bit lame at some points, are extremely exciting. The car chases & races are bigger than those from the original, and the film is chock-full of ""hot cars and hotter women."" As a man who needs a good script to enjoy a film most of the time, I can't give this one the edge over the first of the series. . . but, it's definitely up there with it.Final Verdict: 7/10.-AP3-",Shattered_Wake,2009-06-15,2009

8.0,"All you need from an action movie.. engines, explosions and Vin Diesel",This movie picks up from where the first movie left off. Dominic(Vin Diesel) and Letty(Michelle Rodriguez) are hiding pulling jobs just for the fun of it but Dom knows that none's safe around him and decides to leave Letty. In the city FBI is trying to get their hands on the Drug-lord (Campos) and Brian (Paul Walker) is on the hunt. Letty makes a deal with Brian to cleanse Dom of all charges and in turn go in undercover as an informant. A job goes bad and she gets killed by the bad guy (Fenix) who works for Campos. Dom goes hungry for revenge and is back on the streets looking for the killer. Brian and Dom team up in catching these bad guys and of course Dom kills Felix. In between all this plot is extreme street racing with big engines and loads of action. The movie is well directed and fully satiates your hunger for action adventure and speeding cars. I just loved the first movie so i always wanted the same cast appearing again and thankfully this one didn't disappoint. Vin Diesel is as good as ever.. his screen presence is phenomenal and rest of the cast is great too. I quite liked the opening car race sequence and the rest of the movie was good enough to keep me glued to the chair. Well in the end Dom gets a trial and Brian as an FBI officer testifies and pleads for dropping of all charges but court finds him guilty and sentences 25 years. Brian and Dom's sister get furious with all this and try to get Dom out and thats where it ends. Another open ending for a possible sequel which makes everyone happy i guess.,WalkThatTalk,2009-04-05,2009

8.0,Fast & Furious But Anti-Climactic,"High-octane driving, treacherous villains, challenging predicaments and life and death stakes fuel the fourth entry in ‘The Fast and the Furious’ film franchise. This fast-wheels and sexy-sirens series spun out of control after the Dom-less sophomore entry ‘2 Fast 2 Furious’ then regained momentary traction with ‘The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.’ Nevertheless, the third escapade lacked Dom and Brian but held up strictly because it was fresher than the second one. Life is back in the right land and hings careening into the home stretch with ‘Fast & Furious.’ Brawny Vin Diesel is back full-time in this one after a cameo in the previous outing. Paul Walker reprises his role as FBI Agent Brian O'Connor who is as smooth with his lies as he is with his cars. Indeed, two other originals encore, principally Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster. The chief problems with ‘Fast & Furious’ are its formula sequelitis and its unbelievable storytelling. Like most standard sequels, one of the originals has to bite the dust to keep things exciting and this time around it is bad girl Michelle, but she goes out for a good cause. You don't expect a ‘Fast and Furious’ movie to be credible, but the use of the caves as a smuggler's highway through mountains stretches things to blow-out point. The way that the drivers haul booty through these claustrophobic spaces may be hair-raising as hell but it is also terribly unrealistic. Like the previous entry, director Justin Lin and scenarist Chris Morgan strut their best stuff during the first 30 minutes while the last quarter hour suffers. The ending will leave you looking fora fifth sequel. This is the first time that Dom and Brian, who were pitted against each other in ‘The Fast and the Furious,’ square off again and Morgan answers the question as to why the FBI guy let the gearhead go. ‘Fast & Furious’ opens with an action set-piece that director Justin Lin and scenarist Chris Morgan cannot top. Protagonists Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel of ‘The Pacificer’) and Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez of ‘Girlfight’)are stealing gasoline tanker cars from a lone trucker in the Dominician Republic. Thief is no picnic for the principals. Dom runs interference while Letty, equipped with a canister of dry ice, freezes the coupling devices holding the tanker cars together so that their accomplices can whirl around bootlegger style and hook on and haul ass away. Things go south when the trucker spots Letty atop a tanker car. He swerves and things get hairy. Eventually, after four tanker cars are heisted, Dom wants Letty off the train. About the same time the driver bails. Letty leaps back onto Dom's car, while the truck flips and a tanker car tumbles sideways down a narrow road at our principals. Dom displays his icy cool demeanor and gets them out of there. The law is down on them in no time and they have to clear out. Letty heads back to America while Dom holes up in Panama City, Panama. One day, Mia (Jordana Brewster) gives her big brother a call and informs him that Letty has been murdered. Dom heads back to the states in search of Letty's killer while Brian recruits him to help the FBI nail a notorious drug smuggler. Brian O'Connor's first scene takes place in downtown L.A. as he chases a suspect across rooftops to get the name of a hood who works for the ruthless drug smuggler Arturo Braga. O'Connor's boss is afraid that he has put himself out on a limb by reinstating O'Connor. Now, the Feds have 72 hours to bust Braga before they are jettisoned from the investigation. Naturally, the FBI establishes surveillance squads around the cemetery where Letty is being buried. Predictably, Dom shows up but keeps well hidden as the funeral is held. He hooks up with his sister and investigates the crash site, discovers traces of nitrometh and sets out to find the same suspect, David Park, that Brian is tracking down. Eventually, our heroes paths cross and they go after Braga with different motives. Before long, Dom and Brian--working undercover again--become drivers for Braga. The action never lets up but it gets progressively more far-fetched until it screeches to a halt in a series of caves threading a mountain on the Mexican/American border.",zardoz-13,2011-04-30,2011
6.0,Another enjoyable actioner in the franchise.,"Just like the original 'The Fast and the Furious', this film starts off with an impressive truck heist scene - this time a big oil tanker. Although - here - they are pushing reality to the limits.'Fast & Furious' is best viewed as a direct sequel to 2001's 'The Fast and the Furious'. Justin Lin is back in the director's chair. Brian (Paul Walker) is again working for the FBI. Dom (Vin Diesel) and his sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster) are the only original members back for another round. Dom's girlfriend, Letty (Michelle Rodriquez) as well, but only for a very short while. Han (Sung Kang) is in the film's first moments as well, and might seem confusing if you've seen 'Fast and the Furious 3: Tokyo Drift' before this.The film revolves around a drug lord, Braga, who needs racers to transport a shipment of heroin from Mexico to the States. Off course, Dom and Brian are selected, along with a few others. While Brian investigates Braga for the FBI, Dom investigates Letty's murder. There's constant rivalry between Brian and Dom and they're not the friends they were in the original film.'Fast & Furious' is not as easy to follow as 'The Fast and the Furious', but there are a few interesting twists, especially regarding Braga towards the end. There's loads of action and amazing cars. The Mexican desert scene was incredible, as well as the finale with cars racing through an underground tunnel from Mexico to the States. Well done.",paulclaassen,2020-07-26,2020

7.0,The title says it all.,"This film is pure action fantasy. Pay no attention to the story. This film is for those millions of us who like action movies, especially those that involve chase scenes. This is the 4 th film in the series, granted the third one was from hunger. This makes up for it. Justin Lin directed from Chris Morgan's screenplay. Vin Diesal & Paul Walker are a great team. There will be a part 5. Of the 106 minute running time, I would hazard a guess that 75 of those are taken up by Auto chase scenes. The stunts & CGI effects are excellent. Do not expect a great story, just sit back & be taken in by the fancy heroics of the 2 stars.

7.0,"A return to the original, but not as good.","Recap: Unable to stay in the US Dominic Toretto and his gang take their operation to Latin America. But after their latest heist, the hi-jacking of a fuel truck, they begin to feel the heat even there. To save her from the fallout around him, Dominic leaves Letty and vanishes in Panama. But the news of Letty's murder bring him back to the States, in vengeance. Apparently the drug lord Braga is responsible, and coincidently old acquaintance Brian O'Conner is in a FBI task force to bring the same Braga to justice. To get close to him, they must infiltrate Braga's organization that seem to need an endless supply of skilled drivers. Comments: The first in the series was a rejuvenation to the genre, and in some ways even something of a pioneer. Since then a few sequels have been made, none even close to the original. Now the original gang has returned and especially Vin Diesel brings some of the luster back. But what was once new and fresh and thrilling soon becomes tedious when nothing new is brought to the table. This installment of Fast and Furious has a decent story, some good action but brings little new. When the solution to everything is a high speed car chase, it does seem a little simple minded after a while. And it certainly doesn't seem that thrilling as it once did. Yet, it is good entertainment. Vin Diesel certainly knows how to do it. What is unfortunate is the continually small parts Jordana Brewster gets. She might be the most talented of them all (this from previous movies), and got a fatally alluring smile to boot. Even if it doesn't have any new ideas, the old ones is still entertaining. And at the end I almost wished that another sequel will be made. One hopefully with roughly the same cast, but with some new ideas. 7 revved up engines out of 10.",Enchorde,2009-12-01,2009
7.0,Not to be confused with The Fast and the Furious,"The 4th installment of the Fast & Furious franchise called Fast & and Furious not to be confused with The Fast and the Furious. Which one of the many dumb things about this movie including it takes place before the previous movie, that Brian O'Connor manages to return to being a cop, and the Brian never gives any reason for choosing a life of crime over one in law enforcement but that he respects Dominic more than himself. Before anything else this movie is a dumb entertaining action movie, but there is remnant of a good story, just remnants. The main characters Brain O'Connor and Dominic Toretto start the movie at odds, but ultimately are buddies and are working toward the same goal, the apprehension of the drug dealer. At its core this movie has a base of a good movie, the apprehension of a drug dealer, Brain's struggle with being the good guy, and Dominic's desire for revenge. The chase for the drug dealer is a good action plot with a twist of who Braga is from my perspective I don't think obvious, and lead to an awesome car chase at the end. This the template for all the action and exciting sequences that you can't complain about. Brain O'Connor is somehow allowed back in the FBI and allowed to work around Dominic Toretto even though he let him go. The whole movie he is working toward the goal of capturing the Braga, who is essentialy the mission, but his desire to help Dominic and Mia greater than any other desire. His motives for these actions don't make any sense, if he really cared about Dom and Mia he would help them have a change of heart. These movies basicly preach that if crime is where your family than crime is OK. Dominic Toretto, a revenge story is pretty standard for any movie, but in this movie there isn't any push back to stop the revenge it also glorifies revenge. Brian and Dominic are very morally gray and they see their actions as good and even pray that God bless their day where they steal $60 million dollars of heroin and hide it. Also Mia is pushing back from Brain for the first half of the movie and all of the sudden they start making out. Though all of this is wrapped around to be positive because I is so easy to pick a part and adds to the already entertaining factor of the movie. The movie includes many awesome car chases, a chase on foot with Paul Walker, explostions, and Vin Diesel rams into the guy who killed his girlfriend with a car. The movie is entertaining, dumb, and stupid.",mvpdom,2020-06-19,2020
7.0,A mixture of generic crime story and exciting car fantasy,"Tokyo Drift was all about the flashy driftworld of youthful fantasy, rooted in sex, rooted in finding the necessary ego. It could have been something, if only the story ropes weren't tossed without passion or curiosity to bring back something more than mass and noise.This is something else. Cars are, of course, central again. The women and exotic locales, this time the Dominican Republic and Mexico. Vin Diesel is back, so we get heroics of a more action-y nature, guns and kicking. We get revenge as a main narrative engine and the Feds on the trail of a dangerous drug-lord from Mexico, which do even less to distinguish the film from the bulk of crime action films. The film is generic crime, only more unrealistic.It makes a real difference, however, if you can put aside the absence of what you pretty much knew was not going to be there in the first place, it means you aren't bothered that it's not playing your favorite Debussy at the r'n'b pool-party. The party can still be a helluva time.It's all about the gravity of speed and crashing things for me, extended to eye consciousness.This is a more elaborate notion of realism that I'm talking about, I mean the stunts themselves are unbelievable if you pause to think of what you just saw, it plainly defies physics. It's all about gravity in the eye. The first scene is characteristic of this, our team is hijacking a gas truck en route, one is up on the truck breaking off the wagons which have been hitched to another truck running in reverse which then can speed off with the payload. We are so beyond physics here, that at one point the (unmanned) truck swerves seemingly by itself, metaphysically, to hit our guy's car. It works.Unstoppable is the pinnacle of this mechanized eye craft because it 'looks' to both story metaphor and inner urges, but this is pretty damn good for just the excitement it generates, the splintered image. The story is crisp and compact, moves fast sketching a world with simple mechanics. It's only the narrative support so cars can whizz by, screech, swerve, and bump into things. The camera similarly spins, whirls and shoots by, flying shards slicing our sight.The template for the car fantasy is, naturally, The French Connection.",chaos-rampant,2013-07-12,2013
6.0,Same old but slightly enhanced formula.,"Fast & Furious, the fourth in line of the Fast and the Furious franchise, uses the same old formula that makes the first three movies good and then trimmed off the little things that make them bad.The story kicks off with the return of some familiar faces, namely, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his band of brothers – and girlfriend, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) – in an attempt to steal some petrol, in which they succeed. But Dom is a wanted man. And being an honorable wanted man that he is, he left his friends in hope that the cops would come for him instead of them. Skip a few years later, Dom gets a call from his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) telling him that his beloved girlfriend is murdered. And that is generally the plot of this movie: Dom's out to find the person responsible for Letty's death.And then in come another familiar face, the undercover cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), in a very fast and adrenaline-rushed chase scene. That is, on foot and from rooftop to rooftop. That is one of the most exciting scenes in the movie.Brian is on a hunt for a drug-dealer, who is actually the same guy that Dom is trying to find. So they teamed up... just like old times.Fast & Furious is really for fans only. New-comers might not understand the connection between the characters, but the story itself is quite easy to follow, with some surprising twist in the plot.But it was a disappointment to see that some of the action sequences are done in CGI, namely the tunnel scenes. This really takes away the excitement that the first three movies offer. And also, this movie is way too serious. Instead of the cars and races, we're focused on Dom's quest for revenge which could be a drag after a while.If you just let go of the bad dialogues and some plot holes, and probably the lack of action, Fast & Furious is actually not bad. It's still fast and still furious, and with a more matured storyline.But if they're planning for a sequel, I suggest that they get back to the original theme of the franchise, which is racing and cars.",SophomoreSlump,2009-04-10,2009
9.0,The best in the series yet..!!,"Fast and furious has a good story. There are also great twists and a superb suspense. There is no dearth of adrenaline pumping and heart-stopping scenes. The film begins at such a high octane level that it gets you hooked on almost instantly. The director of the film and director of action do a stunning job of co-ordinating the action sequences brilliantly. The stunning cinematography also adds to the effect. Vin Diesel is the man that makes this series what it is. He is absolutely outstanding. His perfect partner in crime, Paul Walker, is no less. He is cool and effortless.The rest of the cast does good as well. All in all, a must watch.",ankishraj,2014-02-16,2014
7.0,Highly entertaining,"For the people who don't like the F&F series: Don't go watch it, because everything that makes you don't like this movie is in it. But on the other side, for all of you who are a fans of the series: this is a must see, because everything that makes you like this movie is in it. Fast cars, trusted characters and needless to say, a lot of action. The plot isn't the strongest aspect of this film, neither is the level of acting. But I get the feeling the creators of the movie didn't want it to be strong, compelling, innovating or confronting. 'Just sit back and enjoy the ride'. And if you let the movie take control of you, it will be a crazy one.Me, being a fan of the series, liked this movie a lot. Therefore I give it a 7/10. But don't go look for a good story or great acting work.",woutfontane,2009-04-07,2009
4.0,Fast 4: How Are These Still a Thing?,"So, fourth in the franchise and it really makes you wonder how this ever managed to see a 5th film. Yeah, the first one is fun but then you get 3 whiffs in a row and somehow it still got another shot. In the case of this one, it's not bad per say, it's just remarkably underwhelming, perfectly bland and vanilla. We also get a return of some of the wretched CGI that plagued previous films.The only real memorable part of this movie is that Gal Gadot is in there and to see Wonder Woman popping up in one of these flicks is kinda shocking. Really not a good enough reason to check this out though.",questl-18592,2021-08-06,2021
8.0,best one yet!,"This film, unlike the second and third installment, had a strong plot. if you like the F&F Franchise and go into the theater with a positive attitude, you will not be disappointed. unlike any other installment in the franchise, there is a much bigger variety of cars as well. much more of that good ol' American Muscle. and who can you think of that looks more bada$$ than Vin Diesel behind the wheel of a Chevelle and a Charger? and not to mention the babes! I mean thats what this series is all about right?Cars, babes, and mischief.overall, if you dig the franchise as much as i do, or even if u just like cars and racing, this is the movie for you. it is much more action packed than all of the other ones.",badblueboyz77,2009-04-04,2009

5.0,It's a decent movie.,"They put way too much emphasis on nitrous oxide in all the races. But if you've had any experience at all with cars or street racing, you know that nitrous oxide isn't all that the movie makes it out to be. You don't simply turn it one whenever you want to win or accelerate at random. It's really sad that they don't focus on the cars themselves more.To all the others. Please only review the movie itself. Don't simply complain about ads. Ads are advertisements. Advertisements are commercials. Commercials are commerce and commerce is money. They need money to make the game so complaining about ads is just a waste of everyone's time.",dbarr123,2023-05-22,2023
7.0,"Fast & Furious- Fickle, Faulting, Forget About It 0*","Every subject is supposed to have a verb. Every film should have a plot. This film is an absolute joke. What's the story here? In fact, what is going on at all? An FBI agent dating a mobster's sister joins with him in bringing down a drug kingpin. Trouble is that there is no story except for a series of car chases and fighting. There isn't even really a semblance of a plot. To placate the youth of today attending movies, writers have just about given up. This is nothing more than 1:43 minutes of utter nonsense. This is a masquerade of film.",edwagreen,2010-03-08,2010
7.0,"All Told a Good, Enjoyable Entry","It goes without saying that the Fast and Furious franchise hasn't had a good run with the critics. Yet the films have had a mostly fair run at the box office, so they've gradually been released. The first entry is almost unanimously regarded as the best in the series while the second and third are typically frowned upon. For my two cents, the first and third are about equal while the second is best kept as a distant, forgettable memory. Given that this film is coming from Justin Lin, who directed Tokyo Drift, the least that should be expected are some well shot action scenes involving cars. Though enthusiasts of the series will also be looking for satisfaction to the story as well. Does it succeed? Yes, in most ways. The film opens with a bang as Dom, Han (from Tokyo Drift) and a couple other unknowns to the series attempt to steal some gas tank trailers off of a truck which, needless to say, doesn't go without a hitch. After this and a quickly filled in plot piece, we find out that Letty gets murdered and Dom naturally seeks revenge and returns to the U.S. With this and a current assignment, Brian O'Connor (from the first two films) is brought into the mix as he attempts to go after the same people Dom hunts down. The premise is decent enough with skepticisms and indecisiveness playing a large role between the characters. Speaking of the characters, one area of concern fans of the series might have is how well they're still executed and fleshed out after nearly ten year absence from each other (in regards to the film's release dates). Fortunately, the main cast mostly pulled off fair enough performances to stay convincing enough, though it isn't without some melodrama here and there. Fortunately, these moments aren't too frequent and don't hinder the film all that much. Diesel manages to pull of the usual 'just decent' performance that he's had in practically all of his films. Walker actually feels like the most fleshed out character and comes off as a better performer than Vin. As for the supporting cast, they're all just fair at best, with only one or two performances any better than that. But since this film is called ‘Fast and Furious’ and is part of that very franchise, what most people will likely expect going in is for it to be, well, fast and furious. In this sense, the film does succeed quite well. Credit definitely has to be given to Lin for the action scenes involving the cars. The action in these parts are frantic and very exciting, with plenty of awesome, speeding cars to add adrenaline to these scenes. If there's anything you'll want to do at the end of the film, it'll be to get in your car and start shattering the speed limits. What Fast and Furious does best is give you an adrenaline rush during its action scenes. The film lives up to its name and will give those wanting some great car action sequences something to enjoy. When action isn't the focus of the film, it's far easier to find issues and be a bit turned off. But if you're a series fan you should be able to enjoy most of what the film offers and will likely walk away quite satisfied as I did. The first and third films are still my favorites in the series, but this installment is about as good as the first film and is miles above the laughable 2 Fast 2 Furious.",Hellrazr360,2009-04-04,2009
6.0,Too much CGI,"A major step up from ""Tokyo Drift"". Nice plot, Brian, Dominic and Mia are back and a worthy opponent make this movie fun to watch. Vin Diesel as Dominic is a perfect match. His presence alone boosts this series up. Paul Walker is just as good.The weak spot of the movie is the CGI action. Too much CGI. The truck explosion in the start to the car chases in the tunnel only ruin this movie. In the latter case, we both don't see much what's happening and it feels less believable and real.I liked the first two more than this sequel, though it's quite entertaining and worth watching ( for the fans of the series ). With the comeback of Brian and Dominic it shows a promise towards the next one.",athena24,2011-05-14,2011

6.0,Fast and Furious (2009) - Jordana Brewster is One of the Sexiest Babes to Ever Roam the Earth!,"The fourth installment of the hit race car series is set after the events of ""2 Fast 2 Furious"", and it's rather to be seen as a third movie. Yes, I'm glad this movie is able to bring back Walker and Diesel on the screen, and the action is still entertaining. But the movie follows the loss of heart, story, characters, and sadly, a little bit of the action. Rarely will people ever still care about what happens to these street-racing maniacs, through their adventures with the law. There's hardly any plot in this movie, and I think nobody can really pay attention, because there isn't one. It's like some random car sale auction has just landed on the big screen, only they end up racing with them. But the movie still follows the same formula as a summer movie, with tons of race cars and hot ladies. This movie has it's bad-ass moments, and it's sometimes touching. But the movie experiences slow action scenes, and they make this movie non-exciting. To make this review quick as possible, ""Fast and Furious"" has the basics of an ""OK"" movie. It doesn't contain any surprises, or any idea about how to make a more better movie in the series, but they still make it look good anyways. ""Fast and Furious"", in my review, ""bad-ass throughout, but totally bland"".",nickmesafilms,2012-01-01,2012
9.0,Very entertaining and satisfying. This movie is one of the reasons I go to movies.,"It is good to see this movie doing well at the Box Office because it was a lot of good, clean, exciting fun. It was good to see Paul Walker, Vin Diesel and crew back together on film. This movie works, not because of the fun and exciting action scenes, but because it has a reasonable solid story as a foundation, dialog was natural for the characters and above all the movie dealt with the theme of loyalty between friends. Above all this is why, in my opinion, the movie is doing so well at the Box Office. Hollywood, please don't start to think that all it takes is bringing stars back on the set from older successful movies and then you will have a hit on your hands. People, including me, like this film above all because it deals with the loyalty between two friends, ever if they are on opposite sides of the law. Everyone of us that might be a potential audience member understands the importance of loyalty, friendship and the sacrifices you might be willing to make for each other. My advice to everyone is treat yourself and your wife to a nice night at the movies. Go catch this with some good friends or with your brother, brothers, sister, sisters, neighbor, work associate or anyone else you enjoy spending time with. Have fun at the theaters! This is one movie perfect for that good time at the movies!",jaredlallatin,2009-04-11,2009
6.0,Fast & Furious - Jamison Slabaugh,A fun thrilling ride as per usual for The Fast and Furious franchise. This film has some minor pacing issues and makes a few mistakes when it comes to plot decisions. I think the plot was really strong in the first half of the film with the surprise of Letty's death. You start to see the friendship and the bond that Brian and Dom used to have reform until the tense that builds when we realize that Letty was working for Brian and Dom freaks out. I think it was a great use of tension until they didn't continue anything with it once the scene cut away. The love story of Brian and Mia in this film is very weak as we don't see anything about how that reforms we just see them randomly start making out in the kitchen. The antagonist is basic and weak in my opinion. We know nothing about him besides he is a drug dealer and he is the reason Letty is dead. He should've had more depth in my opinion. I'm also not sure why these films seem to clock out at 1 hour and 45 minutes instead of taking a few more scenes and giving some more depth to these characters. That or cut down some of the unnecessary junk and replace it with depth. Stop giving us John Wick antagonists. Dom on the other hand has some good development as he finally decides to stop running. Brian decides to finally get his own code straight and start helping his friends and family. Other than that the cinematography in this film is definitely at an all time high for the franchise. The score has also improved. 6/10 STARS.,jamisonslabaugh,2024-07-07,2024
4.0,Fast & Furious (2009),"Directed by Justin Lin. Starring Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, John Ortiz, Gal Gadot, Jack Conley, Shea Whigham, Michelle Rodriguez, Liza Lapira, Laz Alonso, Sung Kang, Tego Calderón, Don Omar. (PG-13)After sitting out a sequel or two, Diesel and Walker are re-teamed as hunk-of-clay Dominic Toretto and scratchy-wooden-plank Brian O'Conner (call 'em Argil n' Poplar!), both out for justice/vengeance against a vaguely nefarious Mexican drug lord. The series was running on fumes by the time they ""got the old gang back together,"" but the production team knew how to craft a loud, sleek machine of populist stupidity, full of fast cars, barely-concealed backsides, substandard CGI, and lots of gravelly proclamations about family, loyalty, and chumps being busters. You get what you expect, but the high-octane chases being reduced to ones-and-zeroes so often is disappointing, as is an instantly forgettable villain who's less threatening than a Geico agent holding insurance claims on all the wrecked candy-colored imports. Not the worst the franchise had to offer, but its technique is more competent than supercharged, and in hindsight, it acted as little more than a transition between the street-racing outlaw dopiness of the previous films and the gargantuan heist/superspy outings to come.43/100",fntstcplnt,2019-09-19,2019
9.0,Cheese sure is tasty,"Ill be the first to tell you: Relative to a by the books ""good"" movie, this movie is horrendous. With that out of the way, Ill explain why its awesome and gets a 9 out of 10.Movies are about having fun, and quite honestly, its not often they pack as much fun in as this one. Lots of cheesy 1 liners, Lots of cheesy explosions, tons of references back to the first Fast and the furious, and lots of pretty sweet cars driving terribly doing absurd things. If you go in expecting anything but an action movie with a couple of semi-forced cheesy side stories, you're in the wrong movie. just sit back, stop thinking, and enjoy the ride.For the record, Im also a huge car guy (I legally race myself, do design and fab work for race cars, and am a mechanical engineer) and admittedly, the original movie is what got me started on cars when I was 14. Even to the car guy this movie is a complete joke, albeit a hilarious one. STi's without drive shafts, AWD cars doing RWD burnouts, and the list goes on with mishaps even with the subject matter. The whole point is that it doesn't matter at all and its just a pointless fun movie.enjoy!",Phanofmuzik-2,2009-04-05,2009
6.0,Back to incomprehensibility,"This review contains spoilers. Fast & Furious or Fast & Furious 4 is the fourth installment to The Fast & Furious franchise. The movie is a sequel to The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift but is more of a direct sequel to 2 Fast 2 Furious. The movie features Paul Walker and Vin Diesel as they reprise their roles of Brian O'Conner and Dominic Toretto respectively. The crew from the first movie confront a drug lord called Braga that wrongs both Dominic and Brian. The plot of this movie is incredibly incomprehensible. Many events in the plot simply happen without any reason or the flimsiest of reasoning. This movie's plot is an excuse to show car chases. The story keeps up the action at the expense of the plot. An example of this is in one car race, Brian is knocked out of the race. He is able to use his FBI connections to re-unite with Dominic Toretto by taking another person's place. The other characters and even the villain simply accept this and allow it to happen. The main story of Letty's murder is not well done. This story feels incredibly flimsy and the audience does not even see the murder happen. It is simply in a flashback scene that is told. I understand that the movie wanted to use this event as the reason for Dominic Toretto's mission but it felt incredibly forced. The finale of the movie improves the rest of the movie. With an explosive finale and the story being wrapped up, the movie concludes in a satisfying way. This movie did set up the rest of the series well and this can be considered this installment's strength. I did look forward to the other future installments because of this movie. The movie ends with the crew assembling and busting Dom out of a prison truck. I do not recommend Fast & Furious. This movie's plot is a jumbled mess. The only redeeming factor for this movie is its place for the rest of the series.",anselmdaniel,2020-09-26,2020
3.0,Definitely Disappointing,"Well, where to begin.... As it might have occurred to you that after seeing a movie you head straight to the toilet in the theatre where people are gathering and waiting in lines, exchanging thoughts about the movie. Actually this time the line was quite long and everybody kept saying the same things. Why do studios always have to make a bad sequel to a great movie (FNF 1)? They wanted to get paid again and again and again? Well, this time the story is over because nobody will want to see the next sequel. I always say to my friends that i can write a better script than this while i am in the bathroom for 5 minutes, and yes, with a cast like this the story should have been MUCH MORE enjoyable, action packed, where the director does not let you breathe (like in the first FNF). Come on, this movie is about cars, the director did not have the first idea about new models (okay, there was one), but that's not even the point. The story should have been! And the characters should have been! Emotions should have been! The movie is all about grief from the beginning, which does not pay well in my opinion. The audience left the theatre without the adrenalin they have paid for, unsatisfied. And in this dangerous financial times it is a huge mistake! The movie has grossed a lot, okay. Because people want to see it with their own eyes that the movie which was great once, went down the gutter, otherwise they won't believe it. Go ahead and watch it, just for the sake of disappointment. If anyone is sorry, I am, believe me.",jammyn,2009-04-09,2009
7.0,In a field of stupid films... this one wins the race,"Its fast, its furious, its also ridiculous, stupid, and immoral. If you approve of torture, criminals who are good guys, cops who act like criminals, and organized criminals who kill their successful employees, well, heres the film for you. Vin Deisal plays the most anti-heroic hero I've seen in recent years. The fact that he is an unrepentant pirate is ignored as we are supposed to feel sorry for his incarceration at the end. But of all the scenes, the one where the crime boss tries to kill the successful drives who deliver the drugs. Why would they do that. Its an echo of a similarly ridiculous scene from the Dark Knight but this guy doesn't wear a scared smile. How did Hollywood get so out of touch with criminal behaviour. Anyway, check your brain at the door cause this one is remarkably senseless, and pointless and idiotic etc.. Its not all bad. The action is pretty cool at times, though you can tell the stunts are fake.",ntsci,2009-08-24,2009
7.0,Below my expectations,"ChatGPT
""Fast & Furious 4"" emerges as the fourth installment in the series, presenting itself to the audience. The film maintains its focus on action and adrenaline, making a return with familiar characters from previous movies. Starring Paul Walker and Vin Diesel, this installment follows the team's endeavor to tackle the criminal underworld.The action scenes and car races continue to be the foundational elements of the series. Quick cuts and captivating visual effects succeed in keeping the audience glued to the screen. However, the plot can sometimes be predictable and lacking depth. Character development is emphasized less than in the previous films, which leaves the film somewhat incomplete in this aspect.From a visual perspective, the film's choice of locations and its cinematography are impressive. Scenes set in various places provide viewers with visual diversity. The movie offers a satisfying experience for enthusiasts of action and speed, while it could have invested more effort into crafting a more intricate story and character depth.In conclusion, ""Fast & Furious 4"" maintains the characteristic action of the series, yet it bears some shortcomings in terms of its plot and character development. It could be engaging for fans of the series, but might not prove as satisfying for viewers seeking more depth.",uhudsavascisi,2023-08-18,2023

8.0,"Spirited ""Fast and Furious""","Director Justin Lin has a distinctive thrilling visual style. The opening sequence of his ‘Fast & Furious’ is an amazing adrenaline rush. Dom (Vin Diesel) and his girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) highjack a cargo truck careening down a ravine in the Dominican Republic. Dom, unflinchingly guts out a crazy maneuver that saves himself and Letty from fiery death. This establishes the tone for ‘Fast & Furious’: extreme and full throttle. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker reunite in this satisfying re-energizing of the franchise. Justin Lin generates spectacular eye candy: strong heroes, slick cars, gorgeous women, intense action, and some to the wildest high speed sequences. The soundtrack is pretty hot, too.What is interesting: this time around Chris Morgan's story is about vengeance. What works is the dynamic chemistry of Diesel and Walker. Diesel is not breaking new territory. He plays to his strength as the powerful dark hero, who follows a code of honor. Paul Walker is a pleasant surprise. He infuses a force and charisma in Brian O'Connor. Walker has become a stronger actor since ‘The Fast and the Furious’. This time around he and Diesel are true screen partners. Theirs is a partnership of friction, brotherhood, and ultimately of respect which grounds ‘Fast and Furious’. In one scene former girlfriend and Dom's younger sister Mia (beautiful and strong Jordana Brewster) asks why Brian (Walker) let Dom (Diesel) go 8 years ago. Brian tells Mia it's because Dom taught him: ‘Nothing matters unless you have a code.’ Brian also confesses that he is still trying to find his own code. After Dom's stunt in the Dominican Republic, the authorities are closing in on him. To protect the love of his life, Letty (Rodriguez), he leaves her the money and disappears. However, while in exile Mia breaks the news to Dom that Letty has been murdered back home in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, FBI Agent O'Connor is hunting down the mysterious drug cartel kingpin Baraga, who is able to move large shipments of narcotics across the border with his elite drivers. Brian is also tracking down Dom, who he knows will come back to Los Angeles because of the personal tragedy. Dom returns home just flying under the FBI radar. He has Mia show him where Letty was killed in a car crash. Dom discerns that Letty was brutally murdered, and that the murderer left a distinguishing signature. Mia pleads with Dom to let this go: this will not bring Letty back. Dom sullenly declared, ‘It's already too late.’ He intends to kill Letty's murderer and find the man ultimately responsible. All paths lead to the mysterious Baraga. So Dom and Brian's destinies collide as they compete as drivers for Baraga's right hand Campos (slick John Ortiz). That race too, is another spectacular mind blowing ride through the trafficked streets of Los Angeles. Okay much of ‘Fast and Furious’ is predictable and formulae; however, Justin Lin does so with amazing style and verve. He keeps the action crisp and vibrant. Diesel and Walker are solid heroes to cheer for. Bad guys Campos (Ortiz) and Fenix (ruthless Laz Alonzo) are completely despicable. Jordana Brewster is the right blend of tough and smart as Mia. Surprisingly good is beautiful and enigmatic Gal Gadot as Gisele, who has a soft spot for Dom. ‘Fast and Furious’ is a high speed vengeance tale with charismatic heroes Diesel and Walker. Director Lin keeps our attention with hot cars, hot women, and spectacular stunts. ‘Fast and Furious’ is not going win any awards, but it is thoroughly entertaining.",jon.h.ochiai,2009-04-12,2009

4.0,First Five Minutes. Over,"Definitely, good for car-fans. Since I'm not one of them, I tried to view it as objectively as I could.The first five minutes rock indeed - a masterwork of ""road-action"". But, once we get over them, and the REAL ACTION begins, all goes constantly down, to ultimately fall sort of flat. The main failure remains what was purported to me, in the movie-writing terminology, the ""main event"": the demented car race trough the Los Angeles traffic - much below what it should have been! Between the chases and other hot-wheels scenes, the story-line is uselessly complicated, and the directing, correct and nothing more. Points again for he stylish animation of the final credits. And this should be all. Sadly inferior to ""Death Race"", for instance, which DID KNOW how to deliver to motor-fans!",Mihnea_aka_Pitbull,2009-04-02,2009
10.0,"As thrilling as the first movie, but w/ dramatic, original plot, AND: THE ORIGINAL PLAYERS are back!!","Fourth in a franchise- wow. What are the chances that sequels ever amount to squat? (maybe 50/50). Although the first movie was all about cars, booze, and women (but a GREAT movie w/ a kick-ass cast); the second movie had basically the same plot, but with new characters- also a good watch though; Tokyo Drift started to show weakness, and what I thought would be the end of the run. Well, here comes Fast and Furious- fourth of the franchise, and I had doubts: The movie starts with the thrilling action right away (as did the first), but takes a turn in a different direction. The main key, was getting all of THE original players back. Then, adding a new twist: BIG emotional issues (like tissue-box). This was not about car racing (muscle cars, big engines)- although enough to enjoy, but instead, this time the movie focuses more on revenge, broken hearts, and dramatic scenes- as opposed to racing for money/titles, fighting, and general b.s.. The turn-around of events in this movie, is what made it THE best of the ""four""- in my opinion. The producers HAD to make SOME kind of changes, or the franchise would surely go out on a very sour note. If you just want fast cars, nitro boosts, and fast women, skip this one. But if you're ready for some original scripting, and having your heartstrings tugged,watch it! I give this movie a 10! Also,it's been 5 years since Dom and Brian hooked up- the maturity really shows on both sides. (And there are some really cool new ""bad"" guys, too!)Will there be a fifth?.....???????",darkdragon8987,2009-07-29,2009
6.0,Decent,"Fast & Furious (2009), the fourth installment in the Fast and Furious franchise, brings back the original cast and a grittier tone after the more standalone third film. The reunion of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker is a highlight, as their chemistry helps rekindle the dynamic that fans loved from the first movie. The action sequences are well-executed, with high-speed chases and adrenaline-pumping stunts that keep viewers on the edge of their seats.However, while the film delivers in terms of spectacle, it falls short in other areas. The plot is formulaic, with the revenge storyline feeling somewhat predictable and lacking depth. The character development is minimal, and the emotional stakes don't quite land as effectively as they should. Some scenes feel more like a setup for future installments rather than fully realized moments within this one.Overall, Fast & Furious is an entertaining watch, especially for fans of the series, but it doesn't quite hit the same high notes as the original. It's a decent chapter in the franchise, but it doesn't stand out as one of the best. 6/10.",Bmore-Hero,2024-10-18,2024
5.0,Not as good as I hoped...,This movie had a good plot and had good actors. The problem with this movie was that it didn't have enough great car chases and the car chases it did have were uncomfortable to watch as the camera moved so fast. They also used too many special effects. This movie got a 6 because it was interesting to watch. It was pretty exciting (the opening scene for example) but not what I was looking for when I went to the cinema. I wanted a Fast and Furious movie with lots of great car chases. Also it would have been better if it didn't have the camera move so fast and so often on the car chases. It was hard to follow what was going on and it gave me a bit of a headache. The movie wasn't all bad and had some good parts but I think numerous people would be a bit disappointed by this movie.,Foobarman,2009-04-24,2009
6.0,Fast and Furious is another great addition,"Firstly I would like to state that this movie is after 2 fast 2 furious. This movie picks up after 2 Fast 2 Furious which came out six years before this. Tokyo Drift: Was the unwanted third instalment that had Bow Wow and took place in densely populated Tokyo which frankly is not the place for an American action film. Fast and Furious is another great addition to the already great series of these movies. I am really happy to see the original cast back in the film. The cast did a great job. Vin Diesel Maintains his ill-tempered, ‘I'm gonna kill you if you make me angry’ character. Paul Walker, although not a very good actor, played his part very well.",azrail_ramco_43,2012-05-27,2012
6.0,A good reboot to the franchise.,"The Fast and the Furious series got really weak when the first sequel came out without Vin Diesel. Paul Walker is great, but can't carry the series alone. The franchise completely died when Tokyo Drift came out. It was an OK movie, but a sign to everyone that Fast and the Furious was done. We were proved wrong, as Fast and Furious 4 is a good reboot to the series. Plenty of action and excitement. Also the original cast has returned. I thought it was the best of the series...that is until I saw Fast and Furious 6. I'm very curious to see how they fit Paul Walker's death into Brian's character. The studio just announced they would use his already completed scenes for Fast and Furious 7 that comes out in 2015. This series has been getting better with each sequel that comes out, which is the exact opposite of what usually happens. Looking forward to the next one!",doubleb58,2014-01-14,2014
6.0,Awful and good at the same time...,"I've re watched this movie with adult eyes and this movie is pretty awful in every regard. When it came out in 2009, it was the best thing ever! It was an ode to the kids of car culture. We all wanted Skylines and neon glows after watching this. This was our first taste of the culture. The action is like watching a video game and the acting is pretty poor, but eh.. the cars go fast and the girls are cute.If you've never seen it, sit down and check it out.. there are worse ways to spend 2 hours.",Truth_Cuts,2020-02-03,2020

8.0,Best one from the series,"I did not expect much from this movie, except some mindless action movie.It is not that much more but enjoyable and much better than the last few from the same series. Also better then the last James bond movie and especially better than the stupid transporter 3. Well if you don't like car chases you can still follow the story which is not great but not stupid either. I think they could have done more considering the two main characters are on opposite sides of the law and are very close and have a past.Well I don;t like saying too much about the plot etc...don;t expect the best movie of the year either...",rogerg100,2009-04-12,2009
6.0,Good or bad? I really don't know! (Spoiler warning maybe?) :(,"This is my first review, remember that! Feedback? Btw, checking the spoiler box just for the safe of it. So, i know this movie is about racing and cars etc, but let's get serious: There is a big minus in this movie for me. Almost 90% of the time was spent in cars. I know this movie should be about that, but after the first one i really didn't feel like watching the next one. The people (Actors) was great. Both in and outside the cars. The story line i really enjoyed too, or at least most of it. Had some actions witch i like, but should have more of it! Got a bit of track sometimes but i enjoyed it anyway. My score is just a 6, but if you are into cars, racing, or both i recommend this movie to you. Because it had some really good things!",IamVixen,2013-07-14,2013

6.0,"The 2nd best in the series, but flawed.","Fast & Furious is the fourth film in the series. It definitely makes up for the bombs that were 2 fast 2 furious and The Fast and the furious: Tokeyo Drift. I think though, that the newest film is flawed. I lost track of the new film. I also lost a bit of interest in the last half hour. I thought that there was too much action for a Fast and the furious film. There is more action in the opening scene than in the rest of the trilogy. I've never really thought of them as action films, I don't know what they were. I will admit that I liked the new film, but it wasn't really worth the 6.7 that it received. Also, the dialog is poor. Like in most action films, but this film goes a bit farther. I appreciated how the original cast returned, but I didn't really appreciate the film much. Though it was better than the last two films, it wasn't fantastic. it wasn't as good as the first one either. The film just didn't feel like a Fast and the furious film. It just felt like an action packed vendetta that featured cars. I didn't feel The Fast and the furious in it. It was just a noisy, action packed film that featured cars. It would be a 5, but I liked it because I appreciated that the original cast returned and it was somewhat entertaining. It's a **1/2 out of ****. Despite it's flaws, it somewhat works. The Plot: In the 4th film of the popular series, Dom reunites with old acquaintance Brian O'conner when a loved one dies. The two try to track down the killer.",Sirus_the_Virus,2009-09-02,2009
5.0,Mehhh.,"First of all, not my kind of movie but I can enjoy good action flicks enough to go see them- even if I'd rather be laughing or bawling my eyes out. I wasn't an avid fan of the franchise but I kept on hearing really good reviews so I thought I'd go see it. Little did I know that half the movie would be touching on stuff that happened in the previous films under the assumption that I knew who these people were. A little back story and a quick wrap up would have been nice, I was expecting to be able to jump in and enjoy the ride. I REALLY should have re-watched the other movies because than maybe I wouldn't have been so bored watching these people go through the motions. I wanted action, not REALLY terrible dialog between characters I'm unattached to. I mean, walking out I didn't even know their names and I was acutely aware of how uncomfortable a cinema chair was. The writing was so bad I looked over to my brother a dozen times just shaking my head.The car scenes were not redeeming either. There was a single race scene I enjoyed, the rest I couldn't have cared less.Overall, unless you are in love with all the characters you really can't enjoy this film.",snarkiness,2009-04-12,2009
6.0,Maybe the first true sequel in the Franchise,"The rating may be a bit skewed because of how frustrating it was for me to watch this one instead of the original when I decided to dive back into this franchise. The name of this movie being so close to the original when really it is the 4th movie in the series is a little annoying, but then it sort of made sense because it is the first one that truly feels like a sequel. The last two movies had different characters and different storylines, but this one goes back to the basics and does it well. The only reason I knocked it down a point from the original is because it is just so similar, but lacks some of the dramatic complexities from the first movie. However, if you are looking for this one to scratch that itch the first movie gave you, it is an excellent choice. Some of the driving sequences in this one are really great.",jaredlemin,2025-01-09,2025
7.0,Time to Race! (Again!),"Review:It's really more of the same stuff from the first three movies with the cars. So nothing really new. However I am glad that we finally got an actual direct sequel to the Original movie with The Four Main Stars returning (Diesel, Walker, Rodriguez, and Brewster) Takeaways: -The Four main characters of the first movie are back and reunited!! Yay! Well that's actually a little misleading, because SPOILER........................................ Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is seemingly shot and killed in the first 10 minutes of the movie! This of course sets that whole plot in motion, and causes Brian Dominic and Mia to reunite to track down the guy responsible -The whole cast is great again, and it's like they never even left! -Vin Diesel is Back!!! Dominic Torretto was still Street racing and still robbing things with Letty. They have been hiding in the Dominican Republic with new comrade Han Lue (a returning Sung Kang. This movie took place before his death in Movie 3.) however Dom is angry after Letty is killed and he is going after the man who killed her for vengeance. He strikes a deal with Brian O'Connor to help bust the criminal operation that Letty's killer is a part of, and in exchange, Brian will make sure Dom gets a pardon and pass from prison for his help. Dom doesn't care about not running, until he finds out that Letty was secretly working with Brian to get Dom's Criminal record wiped, by investigating the crime gang. That was what May have gotten her killed. -Also from this point Foward, Vin Diesel is now one of the guardians of the franchise. Vin Diesel has more involvement with the franchise as series Producer and not just as a Star. -Paul Walker nails it again as Brian! Brian O'Connor is now an FBI Agent tracking down the car crime gang, responsible for Letty's murder. He must also redeem himself in the eyes of the family that he betrayed. At first Dom and Mia want nothing to do with him, because he broke their trust years ago, when he revealed that he was an undercover cop investigating them. When they all team up to get Justice for Letty, Brian eventually reconciles with both of them and he also restarts his relationship with Mia. -Gal Gadot debuts as Street racer Giselle Yashar. -I love that Dom and Brian had a Race Rematch. Though we don't know who actually won lol. -Letty is avenged when Dom shoots down her murderer. He then decides that he is Done with running and with crime, and turns himself in, with the hopes that Brian can fulfill his end of the bargain and clear him. The ending was sad when, the Judge could not fulfill Brian's request and give Don freedom and he sentences Dom to a long time in prison. Brian is furious that the Justice system failed Dom, so he and Mia decide to bust him out of the prison transport. As a result all three of them are now in hiding. Conclusion: it is a sequel that puts a step step in the right direction, and starts a good action packed Brian/Dom/Letty storyline that concludes with the 7th film.",myblueblazer,2023-06-02,2023
7.0,Solid Fun,"The fourth installment in which Dominic Toretto, Brian O'Conner and some other famous characters return.The story begins with Brian O'Conner now working as an agent again and trying to find a dealer known as Braga. Dominic Toretto gets involved in the story, trying to find the killer of Letty.The film is a fun addition to the franchise and gives us more stunts, over the top characters and continues the story solidly.The good thing is that the film is superbly directed and gives us a great insight into the action. The race through the tunnels is especially fun.Explosions, fast cars, speed and fun characters. This movie is made to entertain us and it succeeds in that.The stunts are again excellent and we have the opportunity to see how the team tuned the great cars.There are excellent extras on the blu-ray disc where we can see the whole process.A fun addition to the franchise that works as a fun crime story.",dk777,2023-03-24,2023

9.0,my least favourite,Although this is my least favourite film from the Fast and Furious saga I still love it. The storyline it takes and then getting revenge of Dominic I should say it's just something that isn't like Corey but they wrap it around cars and it's Brian and Dominic meeting again and they've just got a good way to mix it together,miacoop,2021-01-11,2021
7.0,Completely unexplainable hatred for a fine action movie,"I am writing this comment sort of like in response to some quite surprising reviews i found here. So first off let me comment on the complains about the main plot and lack of storyline. What did you expect? This is an action movie based mainly on cars and buffed up guys. Of course it's not Oscar material, it was never meant to be. The plot of this fourth edition in the series is considerably better than that of the last two attempts and maybe a little less compelling when compared to the first movie. It's shallow, the villains are pointed out quite obviously, the ""good guys"" are actually street racing car thieves. Yes we all know that, we've seen it in the previous movies. If you liked them at least one bit you will like this one as well. If you didn't like them what the hell are you doing commenting on this movie? Another person mentioned how unbelievable are some scenes in this movie. I could again point out that this is also a fact for the previous movies but I'm going to take a different approach. It's an action movie. It's main purpose is to make you say ""WOW! No way!"" not shock you with it's realism. Of course it's not believable, of course things like this don't really happen. I'm sorry but if you make a realistic movie about street racing it's going to be quite boring. Overall Fast & Furious is a step up for the near dead series. The return of the original cast was obviously a very good decision. The acting and script are on a far better level and comparable to the first movie's. Finally laying off the border-line absurdly tuned import cars was also a good step because the popularity of those definitely dropped. Instead focusing more on Dom's favorite muscle cars is truly refreshing even though I'm sure everybody liked the new Skyline. I am not a big fan of brainless movies but everybody likes to see an action flick every now and then. I believe Fast & Furious is a very good way to spend a few bucks and a couple of hours provided you are in the mood for some good action-packed race scenes involving the best of the US muscle cars and some good old bad-ass Vin Diesel kind of acting.",bobi_mail,2009-12-07,2009
2.0,"Sometimes ""Fast,"" but rarely ""Furious""","'Fast And Furious' is to testosterone males as 'Twilight' is to young females. Both were geared only to one target audience forgetting everyone else. At least the recent reboot, 'Star Trek' (2009) remembered other demographics. Evidence: 'Fast And Furious' contains almost zero plot, fast moving cars, explosions, buff males and beautiful females – computerized or not, (and speaking of which) a video game atmosphere, male-to-male fighting, guns, bad guys vs. cops, etc, etc. At first, I wasn't going to downgrade this simple movie due to the director knowing its target audience, but then the main stars meet again, for the first time since part 1. It was at that moment, the movie that didn't seem like it could go any further south, it entered the abyss. Yes, I realize the whole attitude of sitting back and just enjoying the, ah hem, ride, but it's hard to ignore the ridiculous storyline, every known cliché, every scene more predictable than the last (Gee, I wonder who the bad guy is), horrid acting, laughable dialogue and completely unrealistic action sequences/scenes. Walker, for one, gets plummeted in the face a dozen times, yet not a drop of blood or bruising surfaces – what's his next movie? 'The A-Team' remake? And Vin Diesel jumps from one 100 mph car to the next to not only avoid certain death, but continues to fight. Even John McClane would say: ""Yeah, right."" I'm sure there are those who will criticize my critique and, again just say, leave your brain at the door, but like my feeling on 'Twilight,' even stereotypical manly men deserve more than this provides. Basically FBI Walker (i.e. Clarice Starling in 'Hannibal') is reckless & on verge of being fired and is chasing down the same drug lord coincidentally on-the-run Vin Diesel is also out to avenge.",thesar-2,2009-05-26,2009
8.0,"Ride or Die, Remember?","With a few meandering and unproductive features, 'Fast & Furious' takes the series to new grounds. Bringing back familiar faces but finally implementing some much needed emotional depth, the fourth installment was the best of the franchise to that date.Back after a short hiatus are Vin Diesel and Paul Walker playing Dom Toretto and Brian O'Connor respectively. Not that the previous two films were entirely pointless, but Dom and Brian are the heart of the films. Without them, you don't get the same feeling of family and meaningful relationships. 'Fast & Furious' may not feature the high-octane stunts and action that its successors do, but it brought the series back to being about family, and particularly the drama that sometimes goes on between family. O'Connor is miraculously back to being an FBI agent after betraying their trust multiple times in the past, but with this series that type of stuff doesn't matter. Toretto is on the run once again since he went missing following the events of the first film. As ridiculous as it is to see Brian once again after Dom, I feel like it was the one last obstacle these two needed before they gained back each other's trust. Once they do, the film takes off. I love all the tension between Brian, Dom, and Mia, especially knowing where all of them end up. But I also love watching the cast drive insanely fast cars at ridiculous speeds and wreck every bit of them. The fourth film still tries to tell a lame undercover racing/drug/crime story with its villain, but the rest of it is a hell of a ride.The supporting cast includes the likes of Michelle Rodriguez, Gal Gadot, Sung Kang, Jordana Brewster, and John Ortiz. The latter plays the villainous Campos and probably has the most depth and/or personality out of any previous F&F antagonist. Rodriguez is back as Letty, who's death (being a central plot line to the film) is probably the most complicated and convoluted death I've ever seen from any franchise, and I'm still not sure I know exactly what happened.Overall, Fast & Furious progressed the series back to its Toretto vs O'Connor roots, but managed to finally give us the balance of emotion and action that we've wanted. It also happens to be the film that set up what is now more of a heist franchise than it is full of big muscles and muscle cars.+Dom & Brian+Finally balances emotion and action+Supporting cast is written and acted very well-Letty's death & Brian's time with the FBI is still puzzling8.2/10",ThomasDrufke,2017-04-11,2017
6.0,Step into Hollywood action.,"""Fast & Furious"" (2009) revitalizes the franchise with a shift towards a more polished Hollywood action, diverging from its street-racing roots. This installment reunites Dom, Mia, and Brian, deepening the series' cherished family theme amidst a backdrop of high-octane chases and dramatic heists. While the ending may tread into cheesy territory, it doesn't detract from the film's overall appeal, which cleverly balances the thrill of action with the warmth of character connections. This blend of elements signals a new direction for the franchise, embracing broader cinematic thrills while staying true to its core values of family and loyalty.",schmittfalte,2024-02-25,2024
2.0,Review of the 4th and Comments on the F&F Series as a whole,"No doubt they will be making a 5th as these movies are cheap enough to make and still moderately successful with the built in fan base. I say with the built in fan base because, with the lack believability of the 3rd one and the 4th one, no one but the rice boys would want to see a 5th one!!! I could write a better script and be a better director than Lin ever thought of being (remember interview where he said he was not a car guy)!!! The 3rd one was just stupid as it was so unrealistic and had no real character development; it just seemed to be a stereotypically western view of Japan. Yakuza and drifting, sure FF4 is just too slow at the start, feeling more like a bad episode of ""Cops"" or something. It was just kind of boring, and it was not like there was any real character development. And, as usual (except for the FF2 to a degree; i.e. FF2 was kind of like Miami Vice), there was no real believable plot; using a secret tunnel and street racers to smuggle drugs, sure, whatever... The races in the movie were just far to scattered, like they wanted to make this a movie about everything except the cars, heck they only showed an R35 once that I could tell (the red car on the screen when Brain is selecting his car) and used the R34 a few times. It felt like it just went on-and-on with its bad take on a cop drama. I was ready to leave before the ending credits, sad... It really felt like they wanted to have some type of one dimensional character development, like they wanted to make a serious work, but it fails at that. It also tries to tie up the ""loose ends"" as they stated they would do, but again, I don't think they should have tried. And Brain back with the FBI, what was with that? I thought that at the end of the 2nd one he was going to open up a tuning garage, what happened? Heck, that could have been more interesting; Brain gets involved with something that has to do with his new tuning shop and some kind of, well heck, organized crime (yes, that does seem to be the only answer the script writers have with this series of movies as a plot engine)! And of course, the end of FF4 works perfectly into the soon-to-be 5th installment! I see it; now Dominic and Brain must flee the USA to Europe and get involved in stopping the smuggling of, you know it, drugs! Oh, and Universal, if you want someone who can really make a real car movie, see me",roadbuster-1,2009-04-04,2009
6.0,The 4th Film in the Series,"Although this movie is the 4th in the series, the story actually takes place between the 2nd and the 3rd films with ""Dominic Toretto"" (Vin Diesel) and his girlfriend ""Letty"" (Michelle Rodriguez) having relocated to the Dominican Republic where they make a living by hijacking trucks transporting gasoline on a local highway and selling the fuel for a hefty profit. Meanwhile, ""Paul Walker"" (Brian O'Connor) has just returned from a successful operation in Miami and is now helping the F.B.I. in Los Angeles in its attempt to capture a notorious drug lord named ""Arturo Braga"" (John Ortiz). However, when Letty is killed by one of Arturo's men, Dominic subsequently returns to Los Angeles to take revenge upon the people involved. Soon both Dominic and Paul run in to each other and begin working together once again. Unfortunately, the cooperation between the two of them isn't fully sanctioned by certain law enforcement officials and as a result Dominic has to be on his guard at all times. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, although the plot was somewhat predictable, it still had some good suspense and a couple of surprises here and there to keep things interesting. Likewise, having two attractive actresses like Gal Gadot (as ""Gisele"") and Jordana Brewster (""Mia"") certainly didn't hurt the scenery in any way either. Slightly above average.",Uriah43,2017-01-23,2017
7.0,Finally!,"After three Fast and the Furious films that were far from enjoyable, I was surprised by how much I was entertained by the fourth installment in the franchise. It was refreshing to see Dom and Brian back together again after years apart. The reunion did not seem forced and there were real moments of conflict between the two of them.The car sequences were fantastic as always and the acting greatly improved over the previous films.

6.0,Return of Vin Diesel,"Everything was so far from reality . Vin Diesel appeared in first part and shown that it can be very good serial of movies . Then we saw something what we didn't like to see . Everything was so far from reality. Second part tried to follow first one but it was so unsuccessful . Third part was some ""postcard"" from Tokyo . Quite disappointing . Then king returned . Movie isn't such exciting like first . Scenes are made very well . This is definitely made on higher level . I think that it is stupid to compare this movie and two previous parts . I really don't like serials where there are some stupid parts . Everyone will like it because movie finally shown other side . I am recommending it to everyone who like real action and excitement.",andro-dolic,2010-03-05,2010
7.0,A return to form for the franchise after losing its way with Tokyo Drift,"Fast & Furious is a solid instalment in the Fast franchise.It benefits from bringing the two best characters in the franchise back together, Vin Diesel's Dom Toretto and Paul Walker's Brian O'Connor.The complicated but blossoming brotherhood between these two men is explored in this film, and this bond and theme of family is a cornerstone of the franchise so it's good to see this being developed.The action sequences and driving stunts are all very enjoyable. A step up from the first few films, but not quite reaching the ludicrousness of later instalments.Justin Lin demonstrates that he really understands this franchise, making an energetic film with a pacey plot, decent twists, and plenty of exhilarating action.All in all this makes for a very fun film, and lets be honest if you are watching a 'Fast' film and are expecting more than just fun then you are barking up the wrong tree.",ethanbresnett,2022-03-27,2022
8.0,The Unexpected Sequel and Underrated Installment in the Series,"The one-two punch of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker return to the streets of Los Angeles in the sequel that essentially turns '2 Fast 2 Furious' and 'Tokyo Drift' into side stories or spin offs. After Vin Diesel left the series, no one expected him to ever return. Then he did... at the end of 'Tokyo Drift'. The movie itself isn't as good as 'Fast Five', 'Fast & Furious 6', 'Furious 7' or 'The Fate of the Furious' but it's the movie that set the plot in motion for the installments to come. Michelle Rodriquez's character begins a tremendous story arc from being presumed dead, to deemed still alive, to losing her memory, etc. Paul Walker's Brian is left to repair the damage with Dom and Mia from 'The Fast and the Furious' from 2001, where they learned he was an LAPD cop working undercover for the FBI. Tensions between Dom and Brian are high when Dom learns Brian was working with Letty to go undercover. Dom later learns Letty was doing it in exchange for Dom's freedom. The movie features in my opinion the greatest street race of any of the 8 movies. The Los Angeles 4 car race to see who will drive for Braga is incredibly well done. It's also the rematch between Dom and Brian from the original's drag race.",Markk-455-632687,2017-04-27,2017

4.0,Lives Up To Its Name,"If your taste in film runs to car chases and blood than Fast & Furious will more than live up to its title. The special effects do somewhat make up for a story that had its origins in another film with the same protagonists in 2001. I suppose you will have to have seen that film to understand what's going on here.Vin Diesel as a career criminal and Paul Walker as the LAPD officer working with the FBI to nail Diesel are back again, picking up where they left off. Some really bad blood happened as Walker in the previous film got intimate with Diesel's sister Jordana Brewster. Now however both are after the same man, a criminal kingpin of mysterious origins who has killed Diesel's sister, Michelle Rodriguez.They both go undercover so to speak each not giving the other's game away. These facts are divulged in those precious few moments between car chases, fights, and shootings which come in abundance.Nothing terribly new here, but the ending is absolutely ludicrous, no way Paul Walker trashes his whole career for what he does.",bkoganbing,2009-04-09,2009
10.0,"Great action, Nice cars and plenty of sexy babes too!","I built this movie of 6 reels last night and screened it in the theater where I work at , Great movie loved it, nice cars nice babes too! Plenty of action and some romance. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker getting a little aged. He (Walker) shows it too when getting his ass kicked by Vin screaming and kicking like a little girl that he is, (funny) Jordana Brewster nice addition to the crew. Hope we see more of this sweet heart in the future! Muscle beats imports any day! you are 4 miles from your destination, you are now 1 mile from your destination! Liked #1, sorry to not see Vin in #2, #3 Tokyo Drift? Where did That one come from? Either way all 4 are great films and will continue to be watched by me on DVD's forever!",5klogiudice,2009-04-02,2009
6.0,"pretty good, could have been better","So, before actually watching this movie, I had high expectations. The movie sort of lived up to it, although not that much. This is a pretty good movie. A lot of action, deep drama, common-sense dialogue. This is pretty much a little grown up movie. This is definitely not a video game kind of movie (nothing like Tokyo Drift).This movie is definitely recommended for all younger people if you like or not like cars. This movie also doesn't have too much racing, which isn't that great. I think it would have been better with more racing instead of a major story plot. The ending was nice/Fast and Furious is more of a serious movie than I expected and the character development is well. I was expecting non-sense 24/7 racing with no dialogue, which it wasn't like that. It turned out alright but not really what I was expected. Hopefully the 5th movie in the series will be better.
As a rewatch 06/03/19' Fast and Furious is solid and more serious than the previous films in the franchise. The action is there as well as the chemistry with the original cast back but the overall plot wasn't nearly that entertaining, and somewhat did drag on.",Floated2,2009-08-05,2009
5.0,Bombastic and irrelevant,"I didn't feel like this instalment needed to exist. It didn't really add much to the series. This time, the story and action were just average. Nothing stood out.",briancham1994,2020-06-01,2020
6.0,Definately Better Than The Second Film,"Fast and Furious is, in my opinion one of the high points of the early Fast films. I could enjoy Fast and the Furious for what it was. 2 Fast 2 Furious I could not really get into despite the awesome races. Fast and Furious is where I started to like and get into the franchise. There are many reasons for why this is.I find the characters to be better this time around. Vin Diesel's character, Toretto, is back with a vengeance. Him being back, and his character arc in this is one of the main reasons I like this film more than the previous ones. I am also a fan of revenge stories, which made me enjoy this more.I like Paul Walker's character, Brian, more here than any of the previous films. He seems more mature and professional here. In this film he has been reinstated as an FBI agent. I still do not really buy him as an FBI agent; he does come off as more professional and less of a punk in this movie.Jordana Brewster, from the first film, comes back as Mia, who is Brian's love interest. I thought she was fine, but she is not given much to do. The other characters are not much.The villain is also very lazy. The Fast films have never had strong villains, but I find this one particularly weak. The villain in this movie along with the villain in the first film is probably my least favorite villains of these movies.The races are still fun to watch. The races here are probably some of my favorite of the franchise. Although there is some very obvious CGI used in some of the races and car chases which might take you out. There was CGI used in the previous films as well, but here it is particularly noticeable. The CG did irk me, but it did not ruin the action.Overall, Fast and Furious is my second favorite Fast film so far. I definitely like it more than the films before it. I like the darker tone, as well as Vin Diesel and his character arc. The races were also good despite the noticeable CGI. For those who are fans of this franchise give this a look if you have not already.",mitchell5954,2019-08-17,2019
6.0,Not one of it's kind,"First off, I think they shouldn't be making actions scenes in the very beginning of any movie. Putting up a story first might be more interesting for the viewer to understand what's happening.""Fast & Furious"" is different from it's predecessors. While the others were more focused on teen experiences with speeding cars, girls and drug traffic, this one prefers to put lots of action scenes and attract the older audience. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, I'm just saying it's different from what I expected (based on the previous films). The action scenes are much more intense than they were in the past, thought the cars aren't that amazing anymore. Or I'm getting used to seeing speed cars every time, or they're not improving them anymore. Either way, this movie will probably entertain you and the end will give a nice clue of how the next plot's film is gonna be. Give it a watch anyways...",raulfaust,2011-06-28,2011
7.0,Entertaining,"Fast and Furious 12A - *** I haven't seen the other three films of the fast and furious series so I didn't really know where everyone was at for this film, and apparently this is set in-between the first and the second film (this is the forth), just to confuse everyone. This could be seen as the first actual sequel, but as already said this didn't mean anything to me.Its starts off with Vin Diesel and his gang stealing oil from and oil tanker thing which is definitely one of the highlights of the film, after this there is cop Paul Walker chasing down this guy who eventually gives him a name who they track down though the rest of the film. Hopefully you won't go to see the film for the story, but what I picked up was that this is a revenge movie of sorts.The cast was alright, there's only really two of mention which is Paul Walker who does fine, it's not anything amazing but it wasn't bad. The other actor is Vin Diesel, I'm not too keen on Vin Diesel. I don't much like his voice, he body doesn't make sense and I don't really think he's a good actor, but I guess he does great at being what Vin Diesel does.Obviously the main feature of this film is cars, which there are a few off. Am not really into to cars, but even I enjoyed the races, the stunts and the crashes, so if your not into cars either don't worry you should enjoy everything as much as me. If you are into cars you should enjoy them more then me.Overall the story is the weak point, you just end up not caring about anything or anyone and its confusing there being a eight year gap for a sequel. But if you go to the cinema (Odeon preferably) hoping for cars and girls you wont be disappointed, if you go there looking for a complex story and an award winning film you'll be disappointed.",jonnyk12,2009-04-16,2009
7.0,Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are at it again in Fast and Furious!,"Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) are stealing gasoline at the start of this film with Han Lue (Sung Kang) from the Tokyo Drift film. The cops are close on tracking Dom down and he decides to leave Letty and only to find out sometime later that she is murdered, on which leads into Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) path to find a common enemy. If having watched the other fast and furious films this one takes over as the third movie of the fast and furious films. When making more than three films off one film it seems like they tie the fourth film in with the others somewhere to make the plot make sense. Along in this one is all about fast cars, fist fights, and chase scenes. Since all the characters are in the first movie, it makes this movie better to watch as if having replaced the characters with new actors as done with some films that have more than one off of the first film. Having watched the first film of the fast and the furious, you should check this one out because it might intrigue you as much as the first film did. Also this movie stars Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto, Dominic's sister.",brownah18,2009-12-28,2009
10.0,"Great movie, better than present movies","This is a great movie. A lot of action, deep drama, common-sense dialogue. This is pretty much a little grown up movie. This is definitely not a video game kind of movie. Vin Diesel is good in this movie with deep drama and struggle. I liked the dialogue that was real world. I liked the cars.This movie is definitely recommended for all younger people if you like or not like cars. This movie also doesn't have too much racing, which is fine. Watch the movie and your weekend will be much more entertaining. Ending was great too.Director Justin Lin did a fine job of directing the movie, which is crucial to sequel movies that tend to lose the depth and character development. He actually made it more serious movie than I expected and character development is well. I was expecting non-sense 24/7 racing with no dialogue, which it wasn't like that.",tom1111,2009-04-03,2009
7.0,The Tough Race: The Return of Slaps and Screeching Tires,"Vin Diesel is back, and this time, he's not here to ask questions or take selfies with Paul Walker. No, here he's growling, speeding, and tearing up the asphalt like speed traps never existed. This fourth installment feels like seeing your ex who's been hitting CrossFit: tougher, more serious, and thankfully, with less of the childish antics from before.Paul Walker, bless him, is like that friend who always tags along, but you're never quite sure why. He's not bad, but let's be real, he's not carrying this franchise on his shoulders. That's Diesel's job. Walker's the clean-cut sidekick who does his part while Diesel saves the franchise with uppercuts and wheelies.This Fast & Furious feels like an evolution: less flashy neon lights, fewer girls twerking on hoods, and more ground-shaking races like a kaiju stomping out of the ocean. It leans harder into being an action movie rather than just a car show-off competition. That newfound maturity is refreshing, though it might make die-hard fans of the OG ""vroom-vroom"" era shed a tear or two.You can tell Justin Lin wanted to calm things down and give the story some substance. Toretto isn't just a guy who drives fast anymore; now he's a man with trauma, a thirst for revenge, and some deeper reflections. Don't get too excited-it's not Bergman-level introspection-but hey, at least the engines aren't the only thing filling the air.The final chase? A high-octane firework show. It's like Michael Bay on steroids, except the explosions actually have a purpose this time. The action makes you sweat like you're strapped to the hood of a Supra flying down the highway of doom at 250 km/h.This fourth installment is Fast & Furious going dark and mature while still keeping the heart-pounding excitement that fans crave. It smells like grease, vengeance, and family-the Toretto house special. If you're looking for something heavy and aren't afraid of getting hit by a monster truck tire, this one's for you.",OniFR,2025-02-06,2025
4.0,Disappointing,"I'm sorry but this film was a huge let down... The plot was lacking and not very original (catch a drug cartel guy...again). It was great seeing Vin Deisel back in the movie but overall the movie was missing the biggest thing that these movies are about, COOL CARS!! The only decent cars in the entire movie are the ones that Dom's sister drives, Dom's dad's car and one that is is shown driven twice my a supporting actor. I feel they went the completely wrong direction with this movie and forgot about what we all go to see Fast & the Furious films for, sick cars and action packed racing. Hopefully they will come out with another one when they have remembered what the movies became famous for. I would not recommend paying to see this in theaters, this is definitely one to rent when it comes out on video and only if you feel like spending a few bucks to see the Vin Deisel/ Paul Walker combination back in action.",RockyReed,2009-04-09,2009
8.0,Way better than expected,"This was what I was looking for. Raw action, Hot girls, Amazing cars, Original cast. This is what the third movie should have been. Probably the best action movie released in a few years. Less teenage wanna be street race punks and more actual story line involved with this movie. I'm not sure how anyone could down rate this movie unless they actually are intending to. You know what your going to go see when you go to see a title like this. I was pleasantly surprised. Bringing the original cast really payed off, seeing Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and the amazingly beautiful Jordana Brewster back in this film really tied the story together. Definitely a movie to go see in the theaters.",weird_guy81,2009-04-04,2009
6.0,"""I'm a boy who appreciates a good body, regardless of the make.""","FILM: 6.5
Rewatching the 2009 film Fast and Furious, I find myself with mixed feelings about it. This film was touted as a return to form with the original cast back on board. They do elevate it, but I've never been a huge fan of this film as it misses the heart that made the first work so well.One thing I do appreciate is seeing Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, and Jordana Brewster back together. Their chemistry and familiarity bring a certain energy to the film that's hard to deny. However, the storyline doesn't give them as much character development as I'd like. John Ortiz does well as the villain, but it's a shame the main characters don't get as much development.The action sequences are thrilling, and the CGI chases are visually impressive. Yet, as a whole, heart got swapped for CGI and it affects the film a little. The film leans heavily on its high-octane set pieces, sometimes at the expense of the emotional depth that made the first film so compelling. While the action is enjoyable, it feels like something is missing.Despite these shortcomings, it's still an enjoyable way to pass the time. The film manages to keep me entertained with its fast pace and flashy visuals. I also appreciate how this instalment leads to some very entertaining films later on. It sets the stage for the franchise to evolve into the global phenomenon it is today.There are scenes that hint at the deeper connections between characters, even if they're not fully explored. The film's soundtrack also adds to the overall experience, enhancing the high-energy atmosphere.Overall, Fast and Furious is a fairly middling entry in the series that delivers on action but falls short on character development and emotional resonance. While it's not my favourite, it's still a decent film that paves the way for more exciting adventures in the franchise. Your mileage may vary.FORMAT: Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.0

4.0,Unfortunate demise of a good idea,"I am a HUGE fan of cars. There are some cool ones in here. The problem with this movie is not the story line although it is a cliché. I realize that these kinds of things don't happen in real life which makes it more a fantasy than a drama but I think that the directors of movies like this should use real life physics when considering making movies like this or otherwise advertise it as more a Speed Racer type flick. The action in this movie is so unrealistic it is sickening. First of all, I have to say that I love classic cars so much that I get very upset when movies destroy these pieces of our history. Before long, there will be none left at the rate they are destroying these. Okay, now aside from that, if you have even driven these cars like Chevelles and Torinos, you will know that they quite simply just don't handle that well so those sequences in the tunnels are so unrealistic it is sickening. Second of all, who in their right mind would spend a small fortune either buying a wrecked or abandoned classic car and doing all that very expensive and time consuming work to make it look beautiful and handle well only to so readily destroy it? It would be a lot cheaper and quicker to buy a small import of newer American car for the muscle and handling ability. The parts are plentiful, cheap, and most of the cars that they buy are already fairly well set up for speed. It is less time and money consuming to build a newer more readily available car for what they were doing. can't be that easy to get those kind of classic cars and parts to the Virgin Islands for the beginning sequences either. Here is another part that is bad in the movie to me...the FBI is supposedly on the lookout for Toretto...so why would they not know he is going this stuff in one of our own territories? Anyone? Let's suppose he did fly under the radar there, they knew when he got into the states immediately. Was he carrying around about $15-20k in his wallet to buy all the parts and pay for the work to hurry up and fix up that Chevelle SS that (lets assume is genuine - although likely a clone at best) he put a blower and all the electronics and high compression goodies into? That car would have taken weeks to do by one person...even if he is a wizard with mechanics.If you are a classic car lover or a good story lover, pass on this movie. It is a shame because Vin Diesel has done some great movies as far as I am concerned. Knockaround Guys, Riddick movies, for example were good movies. This movie was more like a fantasy like XXX than like a realistic crime fighting racer flick.",super_sportbolt,2009-08-06,2009
7.0,Diesel on Diesel,"You can say a lot of things about Vin Diesel, but one, no.. two roles always remain his most consistent. Diesel as Riddick and as Dominic Toretto. At least in my humble opinion, that is. Where I had my serious doubts watching this installment and seeing Jordana Brewster being the only reason I gave it a try, I must say I am surprised. Surprised that they managed to bring back that feeling, that rush the first installment gave me. Sure the movie has outrageous stunts and uncanny impossible moments. Still, we knew that before the movie started, right. As did almost everyone must've suspected the obvious plot-twists. However it turned out to be more than entertaining. Like said before, it brought back that rush. Almost as if Justin Lin discarded the lacklusters that came after the first movie, including his own Tokyo Drift. The second movie should be seen as midquel (since PR people seem to like this term), Tokyo Drift as a spin-off, and this one as a proper sequel. Well that is, if you want to uphold to the F&F standard.In short: loved the reunited cast, even like the script, can't wait for Fast Five.",dayspring-one,2011-02-17,2011
6.0,Original parts need reworking...,"When an oil truck hijacking goes wrong, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) is forced to leave his girlfriend, Letty (Michelle Rodirguez) and his current crew. However it is not long until he is brought to Los Angeles in order to infiltrate a high speed delivery service under the control of Ramon Campos. At the same time, Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), an FBI agent, has been following a trail of drug deliveries and his investigation leads him to Campos. A sequel to 2 Fast 2 Furious and a prequel to Tokyo Drift, Fast and Furious brings back the cast of the original to give the series a reboot of such, as if Tokyo Drift did not attempt the same feat already. As such, Fast and Furious is very much on par with the first two films: it goes back to home territory in America, and ditches the drifting for pure speed racing. Though there is only a single race in the entire film with various chase sequences, so the main appeal of the film, street racing, is not entirely utilized to full effect. Nevertheless, Fast and Furious does attempt to tell a reasonably interesting story. Reasonably because it never really works by the film's end. The story does not take long to give an emotional pull for the audience, but it pans out rather uninterestedly. Toretto and O'Conner have their own agendas' in the main story arc but it becomes far too neatly wrapped. Any calamities brought about by the first two films, such as O'Connor's betrayal of Mia, are brushed aside and given far too conventional, and easy explanations. Make no mistake, Fast and Furious is all about style over substanc The acting department is not entirely better, but credit must be given to a cast that does indeed try to get the film's feel right with their respective characters. But neither Rodrigruez, Brewster, or the main two, Walker and Diesel, feel anything more then caricatures. And this is a great pity as the script wants to give them more depth but it becomes overshadowed but moderate acting and a weak attempt at story telling; an average script with some weak dialogue doesn't help matters for the actors either. Though while the film lacks depth it does make up for in its method. The entire film oozes sex appeal from the main cast, the many scantily clad women engaging in rather intimate situations, and the lineup of vehicles. The latter does not play as much of a visual importance as seen in Tokyo Drift which is an indication of the film's more character driven narrative. Car sequences mainly revolve around chases with only a single race event taking place. While races would have made for more exciting set pieces the chases do their job at entertaining. Credit must be given to director Justin lin, who provides some stunning cinematography. He is also quite knowledgeable to invoke symbolism into his filming style for a few scenes. One such has O'Connor, on foot, chasing after a man: the scene is shot in quite a jumpy and jagged manner. However the car sequences are far more smooth, as if the main characters are more in their element while riding a car, then they are as themselves. There is no sex or nudity, beyond two focuses on two different sets of lesbians kissing and fondling and many provocative outfits and dancing. Violence is never intense but the car sequences show enough wrecked damage. Language is kept down to mostly scatological terms with no hard swearing. It might be clichéd, but Fast and Furious is both fast and furious though it becomes painstakingly obvious as the film develops that it lacks self-control. It is great to see the old cast return but it all feels like a rather forced effort to relive the glory days of the original. The story tries too much to make all characters comfortable with one another; the acting is never up to standard; and there is sadly only one race scene. The director is really the only person who kick starts the films engine: it is a decent film, but it requires a good load of tuning if it wants to score big.",sinncross,2009-04-16,2009
6.0,"Fast & Furious is about what you'd expect, nothing less and absolutely nothing more!","Fast & Furious is the fourth installment in THE Fast and THE Furious saga. Apparently the title has painted itself into a corner, and taking out the two ‘The's’ constitutes the title for a new installment. But getting past that this movie is basically about what you would expect from this series: Fast cars, sexy women, tough guy mentality E.T.C. Except here's something exciting: The whole original cast is back in action for the first time since the original movie. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, and Jordana Brewster! The plot very basically involves Dominic Toretto (Diesel) wanting revenge on one of his enemies, and in the process has to re-team and form an alliance with his betrayer Agent Brian O' Conner (Walker). That's about it in the plot department. The rest of the movie is full of chase scenes through L.A. streets, Mexican deserts, secret tunnels, and many boring talky scenes between the characters. When Fast & Furious isn't getting bogged down in all the boring dramatic scenes, it's actually a very entertaining movie. The racing and chasing car sequences are exciting and well filmed, and you can really tell a lot of effort and stunt work went into making these scenes exciting. The film opens with Dominic and his cronies stealing giant oil tanks from the biggest tanker truck you will ever see on-screen or in real life. All of this as Michelle Rodriguez is hanging from the side of the truck, an inch away from death, and Dominic comes to her rescue. The races are what makes the movie enjoyable, just like any of the other Fast and the Furious titles. The original movie was an entertaining flick, I remember 2 Fast 2 Furious being awesome (Although I was 12 when I last watched it), and Tokyo Drift, well, I've never seen it. However the real draw-in for this new installment was the return and re-pairing (pun intended) of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, along with Rodriguez and Brewster. It is a welcome return for them in the series and they make this entry memorable. When you get to watch Diesel and Walker race cars with nitro-power for the first time since 2001, you'll be gripping the edge of your seat. However there are quite a few problems with Fast & Furious, although they are very obvious. The acting is not too good, the dialogue is just plain bad and there are way too many talky scenes, and the plot is thinner than construction paper. Whereas the action scenes are entertaining, the dialogue scenes are stiff and dull. There are way too many of them, and most of them just fall flat due to the bad lines and the dead acting. Diesel and Walker both make cool tough guys on screen, but that does not make their technical acting skills any better. They are just dead weight when they're not behind the wheel of a car, and that's just plain disappointing. As for the plot...what plot? I barely even noticed it until the ending and at that point I was confused by what they were doing in Mexico. I also barely even realized John Ortiz was the bad guy until the ending as well, which is obviously not a good thing. That means that except for the movie's main twist (Which takes place in the first 15 minutes), I barely even noticed that there was a plot at all. Now I know you don't go to see a Fast and the Furious movie for the plot, characters, and acting. But if all of those details were better then Fast & Furious would have been a much more satisfying film as a whole, and there is nothing wrong with that. Overall Fast & Furious accomplishes what it set out to do. Which is to entertain you with slick chase/race sequences, incredible stunts and special effects, and the cool presence (Not acting) of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. Fans of the series will probably enjoy it. I enjoyed it for what it was and I can't even call myself a fan of the series. I give Fast & Furious a good 3 out of 5. It's a fun blockbuster movie that entertains you when it doesn't talk too much.",stewiefan201,2009-04-11,2009
6.0,I miss this Dom & Brian pairing!,"This fourth chapter may have had numerous shortcomings, but it succeeded in establishing, or should I say revitalising, the ties between our main leads.I have always admired the pairing of Dom and Brian; their friendship and brotherhood worked marvels over the years, and it's one of the main reasons why I kept returning to the series and never grew tired of it.If Paul had not met with such unfortunate and untimely demise, I do believe this series would have produced more positive outcomes. Brian as a character would have had lots of room to grow, could have had opportunities to flourish, but I guess, it wasn't meant to be, as fate had other plans for him.R. I. P. Paul Walker; We miss you.",SoumikBanerjee1996,2023-06-10,2023
8.0,Just as fast just a little more furious,"Fast and the Furious (4) was the best installment of the series without a question. The first one started it, however the 2nd and 3rd killed it. This one brings back the fast action with a solid plot line. Vin Deisel recovers from a series of terrible character choices lately. All old faces come back to life in this movie and add to the already impressive plot. The movie continues to be fast paced but the emotions rage in this movie far more than any of the others could dream of. I give it an 8/10 for the fact that I felt there were times the movie could have turned something awesome into GREAT. But I like what this movie brought to the table and it raises the bar for action movies this year.",whosyourdrummer1,2009-04-14,2009
7.0,Brilliant film.,It's say Brian is back working for the FBI and the movie he does but in the first movie he worked undercover for the LAPD. And what gets me is when they blame Brian when it was the FBI Agent Stasaik. That gave the go order to arrest Braga/Campos.,wesgunton,2019-04-23,2019
5.0,Fast. But not Furious.,"Finally a great new action flick with intense action scenes and cool driving. Right? Wrong! Fast and Furious was not all bad, it had it's moments. But still something was missing, something was just not the same. Going to see this movie i too was not expecting so much, it's the fourth instalment of a cool series, So it's not easy to keep the Furious of the movie going. Although it was a tad step up from Tokyo drift (Fast & Furious 3) which to me might of killed the series. Yes it's great that the majority of the original cast from the first one are all back, and it's great to see that. I thought it would be something to look forward too, and it probably was, because the original cast such as Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster & Michelle Rodriguez, saved the movie from a huge flop. And obviously the cast is the audience puller, which made people watch this film. But the good acting, didn't change the lousy plot of the film. Some action and racing scenes were quite intense (partically the end) but the movie seemed weak and the fun of the movie was not involved in this 4th instalment. Maybe a OK film to rent, but not really worth it for the big screen. A slight let down from Fast and Furious part 1 and 2. But better then Tokyo Drift no doubt. 6/10",k-dhesi,2009-05-14,2009
9.0,I have to start off with I'm a fan of the franchise. . .,"Now that that's out of the way, this movie goes from ZERO to 90 in 45 seconds. Then it's off to the races my friend, where it doesn't let up 45 minutes later when your in the parking lot of your local movie theater driving off in your car. Forget what you know about the franchise, if you want an ADRENALINE rush it'll be TOO LARGE! You can say what you want about ALL THE originals coming back, but you know what they're a team and they bring out the BEST in each other every time. It's FANTASTIC to see Vin Diesel (DOM), Michelle Rodriguez (Letty), Paul Walker (Brian), & Jordana Brewster (Mia) all reprising roles that brought your attention to them in the first movie. I love that we're in 2009 and technology has brought movies to such amazingly great speeds & heights. I've never seen it used more brilliantly then this is 2 and a half hour thrill ride. Dom's on the run, Brian's back with the FBI, and Mia's holding down the home front back in Cali. Well it wouldn't be a reunion if they all didn't come collide back together in misfortune,racing, and the world's BIGGEST drug trafficker. It just wouldn't be FAST and FURIOUS. Great cars, hot chicks, hot dudes, fantastic action sequences, and the best acting of their careers! GO see it and remember why you loved the first one, and be impressed. I honestly was",Ridonculous31,2009-04-05,2009
6.0,The beginning of action...,"The ""Fast & Furious"" is a really great movie because it has much an action and that makes it interesting and it also has mystery about all of the story from the beginning and now. The combination of these two makes this movie one of the greatest ""The Fast and the Furious"" movies.In this movie we see Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) helping Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) who is working for the FBI and to solve a case about a crime that made in Los Angeles. It's a movie in which we see many things change and some new things happened that will affect all of them.Finally ""Fast & Furious"" it's a movie a little different from all the others from this ""series"" and I think that with this movie starts a new era of ""The Fast and the Furious"".",Thanos_Alfie,2013-11-15,2013
4.0,Not enough female actors,It was all just men cars and sexualization of women. Would've appreciated more female actors and leads,saimabid-01939,2019-09-01,2019
6.0,"Fun , But Too Much of the Same","The movie doesn't disappoint , but it provides you a cookie cutter plot of previous installments. It's still fun seeing this group together, but the story is even less intriguing in parts than the others. The villain has no background other than just a really good drug trafficker and the movie is otherwise used to bring Dom back into the fold. The last chase scene also leaves much to be desired. You often can't tell who is in which car chasing who for about ten minutes. Finally at the end you get the showdown you knew was coming with a very predictable result.Overall it's fine as part of the series but it definitely won't stand out as one of the better ones.",ThereelscoopwithKK,2023-02-22,2023
6.0,When do these movies get fun?,"I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to care about the characters by the time Fast & Furious, the fourth film in the franchise, comes along, but I don't. The Paul/Vin bromance felt bland and I might have even felt some joy when they killed a certain character off. The car chase scenes were also lackluster. When do these movies get fun?",cricketbat,2018-12-28,2018
7.0,Gets the franchise back on track,"After a pretty good debut movie with The Fast and The Furious the two follow-ups were steps back for me. Here the franchise gets started again for what we now know it for. Decision to bring both Brian and Dom back is what makes this one really work. While the villains aren't as strong here, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker really make this fun to watch with the dynamic the two are having. The twist with who is Braga isn't quite pulled off here, I thought this was really predictable but still the car chases and action scenes here are fun and make me look away from the little flaws the story has. So this really was about getting back in form for the three great movies coming next to the franchise.",tk_ew,2024-05-31,2024
8.0,Now that's what being FAST is about!!!,"FAST..........FASTER and.......FASTEST.........all three words describe this one helluva action packed n pacey roller coaster ride........... The Movie opens to an exceedingly amazing action sequence where Dom n his friends, including Letty try to do what they are best at.......yup u right heist.........WOW!!! what a scene. Right after that the movie takes a serious path for a short while. Where Dom leaves Letty sleeping n goes away from her n goes to Panama. That's where he receives a bad news about someone's death(i won't disclose it) but it was a shock.......coz dat was d best character in d series. He then sets out to track down the one responsible. In comes Mr O'Connor looking like that something has changed and believe me it has changed for the better This 'New Model, Old Parts' is working. The action sequences are perfectly shot, Direction is cool, acting was amazing, Vin was cool as ever, the jokes were on the right place and in the right proportion. I thought it was better than Fast And The Furious(part 1). Although in the fast paced movie the script wasn't given much emphasis. But who needs a detailed script if the screenplay is damn good and can keep you on the edge of your seat. I go for 8 out of 10 for Fast and Furious 4.........The Fast just got Faster.....and how. GO WATCH IT!!!........coz u won't regret......",Tim_Jade,2009-04-03,2009
6.0,4 was 4 what?,"In this 4th installment of the franchise I give it 6 stars because as I'm sitting here watching this I'm wondering, why? For some reason this one wasn't all that exciting to me. yes the guys were back together again(Toretto & Brian), here was plenty of action but the stunts in this installment were to stunt like. From the window stunt, car exchange, things like that were OK I guess. But now I'm looking at this and I'm wondering like how can they make this better. I'm a rue believer in when you make a great film unless there is an continuation of the movie there shouldn't be any more added to me it only cheapens the brand. Tokyo Drift was OK because it kind of added or introduced something fresh(the drifting) to the franchise. I also see that in this one the original director was back on board. I'm not understanding how Hanz came back in this installment ... I thought it was much later on in the franchise but anyhow. That's it for this one. Oh but I will say that the installments that came later with the Rock did or was better than 4 ... OK now I'm off to watch the 5th installment, I don't quite remember what it was about but I will find out soon enough. Fast five is what they called it. lol",hersheedontplay,2016-11-25,2016

10.0,Loved it!,"I loved this movie. So much things in it that make me wish that all the Fast and the Furious movies had these two in them. Towards the end of this movie, Dom gets sentenced to 25 to life in prison. You can obviously tell that O'Conner does not like this and storms out of the court room. Then you see Dom on a prison bus, but behind it you see 4 tuned up cars racing up behind the bus. Then it shows O'Conner and Doms sister, and a few other people. Then the movie ends. I really hope to see more Fast and the Furious movies with these two in them. It was simply amazing, I strongly recommend going to the theater and seeing this movie. I HOPE THAT THEY MAKE ANOTHER ONE OFF OF THAT ENDING!!!",flemingc11,2009-04-04,2009
6.0,"A bit too predictable but, in all a decent film","The fourth Fast & Furious movie was basically the two main protagonists in the series Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker) rekindling a long, lost friendship after the two hadn't seen each other in over five years. That's the whole premise of the movie. The whole driving that the series is known for takes a backseat here and Diesel and Walker start to develop a brotherly love relationship. To be honest? The only part of the movie that is worth your time watching is the last 15 minutes. Without giving much away, it's a fun, heist through Mexico that saves the movie from being mediocre. It's not the greatest movie of all time you will watch, but it will suffice you enough without having to skip selecting scenes and what have you.",prestonwardcondra,2015-08-09,2015
5.0,a movie as a video-game - or is it the other way around?,"The latest installment in the Fast & Furious saga (instead of giving it a tune-up in terms of a different title, after 2 Fast & 2 Furious and Tokyo Drift, they just removed the ""The"" words to possibly fool certain viewers), starring again Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, functions fairly competently enough as a car chase and/or car driving picture. That it never involved me in terms of its story or characters could be another matter, but it isn't. It's precisely why this movie, for all of its money and care and sense of ""hey, 13 year old boys will go APE over this"", it's got nothing at all that one would not see in a video game.While I might have thought this could have been a deterrent to its box-office potential it is about to cross the 100 million mark with still more to go. And yet I wonder if I am the only one who, within the first sequence if not a little longer into it, could think ""yeah, didn't I just see this in, oh, any given Grand Theft Auto video game""? And the fact is a Grand Theft Auto game is what this movie is: drug dealers, gangsters, super-slick driving with the occasional guiding voice coupled with dialog that in a video game one would just click ahead to go past. Whatever little plot and character development there was in the first film, which certainly had more fun with itself, is given the pits here.For anyone who's had the pleasure of a GTA experience (the best of them, I mean, not the first one which didn't have nearly the fun of III or Vice City) one can ride cars as fast as possible and even let the Id out as much as wanted - you get star ratings for your wanted level, and mission be damned, just have a good time. The failure of Fast & Furious is that for any moment I could try to get into it as entertainment it pulled back into video game territory, and in a millisecond realize the lack of a controller to take over. It's synthetic entertainment ala Transformers, and while Justin Lin is not the caliber of BOOM-EXPLOSIONS ARE SO COOL! filmmaker like Michael Bay he's lost any sense of real interest in what makes a story work well - sad considering his first film, Better Luck Tomorrow, and the underrated Finishing the Game, did very much just that.If you're a hardcore fan of the franchise- and frankly I never met one and am not sure even the ones in the audience were- you'll dig it a lot. For everyone else, stick to the video-games.",Quinoa1984,2009-04-10,2009
7.0,this film is quite underrated,"this 4th installment in the series is quite underrated i have to say i have seen all of the fast furious films when i first saw this i hated it & thought it was boring because it is slow paced unlike other films but when i saw it the second time my opinion changed & i enjoyed it for what it was this one has a better story just like the first one,this film gave birth to the prequel series of fast & furious the story of the film happens around or after 2 fast & 2 furious. i just have a question how the hell did Jordana Brewster looked so cute here plus the hairstyle was great. one of the biggest things about this is the return of Vin diesel a lot of people though the series are over but Vin diesel just made a huge comeback in film industry with this one the action is nice here but the film itself is very dark & sad at times. for those who don't know Letty goes missing in this film & everyone thinks she is dead what happens is that Letty was working for Brian & Fbi secretly then she joins Braga & his gang but when the gang finds out there is a mole inside they get rid of her she escapes in a car but in the accident looses her memory in some hospital the international gang of Owen Shaw grabs her then she works with them it can be seen in fast n furious 6 later on Dom rescues Letty & defeating Ownen Shaw these events leads up to the emerging of super villain Dekard Shaw(Jason Statham) in furious seven 2015. story:plot is very simple here Brian joins Fbi & Dom returns in the big city together these 2 bring down a notorious drug runner Braga. Dom is hunted by the law here in the end when he gets arrested & being sent to jail Mia & Brian help him escape is one of the best scenes ever filmed in the series,fast five 2011 was nice but this one is better the opening oil tanker robbing scene is fantastic its like a bond film even better & more epic Vin Diesel is a insane man if he actually drove that fast on those mountain roads that's all i have to say. my view of this film is you don,t have to look deeper into this film to understand it it is just like a usual film only with a tight bonded narrative that blends easily with action. Overall Fast & Furious 2009 is a well made film so just grab a copy and enjoy it my rating is 7/10.Recommended",FilmMan47,2016-05-26,2016
7.0,I loved this movie.,"This was the beginning of a franchise and I loved this movie. Please reduce the number of characters in a review, I don't know what to say more. The first film was fresh and exciting and I just came out of theatres after watching Fast X and my respect for this movie has increased. This movie was 100x better than the recent movies in the fast and furious franchise. Totally recommended to watch. Thumbs up from my side. A great beginning of a journey. All the characters played equal and important roles, it was comedic with action at the same time. Good old times. If you want to witness the journey of Dom, this is where you exactly begin. Go for it.",FanOfSuperHeroes,2023-05-18,2023
7.0,"""Ride or die. Remember?"" - Fast & Furious 4 is an action film worth watching, the chemistry between actors and action keeps me coming back","Fast & Furious 4 is the movie in the Fast & Furious franchise that changed my mind on the films, they found their footing and made it an success at the box office. I also believe it's the turning point and I mean how it ventured out of the racing and into heist, crime and action. Not that I'm complaining, it fits the characters and world they have built from the first and second film. F4 is written by Chris Morgan and directed by Justin Lin. It is a direct sequel to The Fast and the Furious whilst being a prequel to Tokyo Drift. The latter whom Justin Lin also directed.The film is again focused on the core characters of Dominic Toretto, Brian O'Conner,
Letty Ortiz, Mia Toretto, Gisele Yashar and Han Lue, whom are portrayed by Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Gal Gadot and Sung Kang. Whilst the villain, Arturo Braga/Ramon Campos is played by John Ortiz. The story goes deeper into the characters and the main theme of family, Gal Gadot and Sung Kang is a great addition to the cast, Sung Kang previously starred in Tokyo Drift which takes place before Fast 7.Earlier in my review I wrote that there were more focus on heist and action. Well F4 is about races and cars too so if you're a fan of that then you'll be excited, there's some very cool cars in this one. The action sequences are bigger and better than ever, higher budget makes that happen. Whilst the action gets better, the logic behind certain things reduces and the characters like Dominic Toretto becomes strong like an ox and able to get shot without even a flinch... Action films like these likes to make it more entertaining than realistic but I won't lie, I still enjoy the movie and will continue to recommend it. Some bad writing and bad acting is alright for a film like this one, Gal Gadot improves immensely though in the next films. The editing is fairly good and so is the pacing, nothing but praise for them on those fronts.",Holt344,2021-06-06,2021
6.0,More the same!,"More the same. Lots of eye candy both human and auto in this film. A thin formulated by the numbers script. However the stunts were OK . Paul Walker saves this movie. Paul Waler is a good actor. However Paul always play in b movies. Maybe, Paul should do b horror movies for a career change. If one includes Walkers acting and the stunts The Fast and Furious, is it four or five, is entertaining. My wife like the movie. However I found the movie just OK; A movie rental night film. I give The Fast and the Furious a six out of ten. I hope the producers of The Fast and the Furious do not make a part six or seven. Enough already.",mm-39,2009-04-07,2009
8.0,Gets things done the Fast and Furious way,"Yes, all your favorite characters from the first finally have their reunion as they are all back in this fourth installment. It takes place 30 minutes after the first (which means 2 Fast and Tokyo Drift) took place after this. Now car thief Dominic Totorro (Diesel) and FBI agent Brian O'Connor (Walker) are out to catch a drug smuggling ring whose leader is a common enemy to both. After one character is killed, Totorro and O'Connor blast muscle cars and speed through the Streets of Los Angeles and even to the Mexican Desert to catch and infiltrate the ring, before it's too late. The latest installment is by far the freshest of the four. I really didn't like Tokyo Drift, and 2 Fast 2 Furious I missed, but this made me want to check out the first one again. This movie is every teen's fantasy: fast cars, girls, explosions, shootouts, it's all in there. Something like this should come out every Friday, but I don't think that will be possible. I know that the critics are being very harsh on this, but they're old, and open minded, so I think you should go out and see this for yourself. Plus seeing that this has already made 72 Million Dollars and is by far the highest grossing movie of the year, I can see it's time to get Fast and Furious again. Apart from the well shot action scenes, and real life stunts (Walker mentioned none of it was CGI), some of the dialogue was quite bad. I don't blame the director or any of the cast members, but parts of the script felt like it was written by 10 year olds. I don't expect real acting from these types of movies but I do expect at least some good acting, and this just didn't deliver it sadly. Fans will all be happy with the latest installment. It's miles better than Tokyo Drift, and although I didn't see number 2, this one beat the original to the finish line for me. You've got great action scenes and Vin Diesel finally back to a good role (I hope this movie treated you more than Babylon A.D did.) All I have to say is if you haven't seen this yet, what are you waiting for? Drive as fast and as furiously as you can to your nearest movie theater, and prepare for pure awesomeness.",mexicospidergreen,2009-04-11,2009

4.0,Can this movie get more ridiculous?,"The answer is NO.This movie was beyond awful. The only reason that I didn't give it a 1/10 is because I watched it with my friends, that means we laughed really hard on stupid scenes, so we kind of enjoyed it. But as a movie it had NOTHING, it was empty, I don't even recall the story! The fighting was boring, the action was CHEESY, the cars weren't that interesting (watch Death Race and you'll know how movies about cars should be) and mostly Vin Diesel was horrible! He is a bad actor, I feel bad for dissing him but he is, and what is up with those muscles? Very distracting - and NO not in a good way.Okay so maybe I enjoyed the movie once or twice during it but that's about it. It is obvious that the target audience is men who want to see some cars flying around and a lot of hot chicks. Okay I GET IT the movie has to have some hot girls but what is UP with the asses? Most of the film was people shouting in Spanish and scenes of girl's asses. How stupider it can be? I have no idea! I know this movie might not be directed to me a 18 year old girl, but I enjoy such movies (yes I don't mind the ""hot chicks"" and ""cars"") I'm into movies with car action! But this movie was just silly.Don't waste your time on it, if you are interested in a COOL FUN movie - WITH HOT CHICKS & CARS - obviously what guys are looking for .. watch Death Race, you WILL enjoy it SO much better! 4/10",Fatmadxb,2009-06-11,2009
9.0,Fast & Furious,"This is the best movie of the series so far. It changed the theme from street racing to drug smuggling/revenge. Firstly, I was happy to see the original crew back for the first time since the first movie. It is too bad we had to lose Letty in the first half hour. It ended up working out though because it set up a plot that I thought was good for a Fast and Furious movie. Brian, back working for the FBI, and Dom who is looking to get revenge on Letty's killer both infiltrate a drug smuggler's driving crew. Time passes, the movie gets good, there was a shocking reveal, and some good action. The movie ended with Dom and Brian capturing Braga and trying to get him back to the USA from Mexico to go to prison. There was a daring drive through smuggling tunnels in the border, and Braga eventually getting arrested. The very end of the film had Dom being transferred to a max security prison with Brian, Mia, and Dom's bickering Dominican pals about to break him out of the bus, setting up Fast 5. This was a great movie and I definitely recommend this to everyone. It is very entertaining, but surely they could have named it something else 😂. The name is almost identical to the first movie's title, The Fast and the Furious.",kaden_lewis,2021-07-04,2021
6.0,Sloppy fun,"I have to be honest - I watched this back-to-back with Fast Five, and that one was kind of amazing, to the point where I now struggle to remember much of what happened in Fast & Furious (AKA the fourth movie in the series). But I still thought it was a pretty decent watch, and arguably the point where the series becomes what it's best known for being. It feels like a proper sequel to the original movie, in contrast to 2 Fast 2 Furious and Tokyo Drift, which almost feel more like spin-offs to the original, in hindsight.It's fascinating watching the series kind of take shape. There are still more old-school car races in this one, and probably the best scene in the film is still a race. But there are hints at the series becoming more here, with those hints paying off in a huge way in the kind of amazing Fast Five. It's a great warm-up for that film, introducing a few characters who'll go on to play a part there, while also bringing the characters of the first movie back together; back onto the same playing field.It is somewhat awkwardly assembled, and certainly has its flaws as an individual movie. But I can already see it as a necessary stepping stone for the Fast and Furious series as a whole. Honestly, even with it being messy, I still think I liked it more than the first and third movies (of the original four, 2 Fast 2 Furious is still the best, though. Guess I'll die on that hill.).",Jeremy_Urquhart,2024-07-27,2024
2.0,when being cool is so terrible,"This movie is all about being cool, but unfortunately they got it all wrongs. The message is very simply: look how cool I am, regardless of what I'm doing. Hey look at my pants, my rims, let me lower my voice to sound like a real man, let me hack using a keyboard (cool hackers do not use a mouse right?), everything, every single aspect of the movie has the same message: look how cool we are. The characters of the movie are just a bunch of high school posers so, if you are an high school kid (and not the smart ones) you might like the movie. The car races are ridiculous, look how good I am at shifting gears. Wow, my mother can shift gears too, big deal. The very meaning of cars racing is nowhere in the movie. How about turning left, or right? how about knowing how to use the break or passing? car racing = shifting gears, ridiculous",srrshop,2016-01-25,2016
6.0,Great. For auto enthusiasts mainly.,"OK, clearly FF was clearly aimed at exploiting fellow gearheads like myself. But while appeasing us, it's also not excluding non-enthusiasts. For the ""jargon"" of shop talk, those who are not in the know, it may sound Greek. What I didn't like about the film; was the formulaic clichés of countless antagonists.The ""sudden twist"" ? Been there, done it. Paul Walker seems content with his flying off the handle shtick and while that suits Running Scared, it seems as though he doesn't pull anything else off. Don't get me started on Diesel though! This movie, did the genre of car related themes, pretty good. For instance: Han. Did Lin not consider the ramifications of killing him in the third film ? That feels like he was back-tracking to make it work.The story is supplemental in a effort to actually...well have a story! For, a car themed movie, It probably seems unnecessary, excessive, or outlandish. What this movie has going for it is plenty of hotties, coveted cars, and eye candy stunts. I will say this much: in contrast to Gone in 60 Seconds, F&F is Hemingway. Gone in...dumped plot in lieu of action. Bruckheimer's trademark. Just don't view F&F hoping for intellectual stimulation. If you want to see bad ass cars, this IMHO, is the best of the quadrilogy. That's my un-wanted $0.02. Ultimately, I think the franchise's attempt to add a cohesive, integral plot has yet to be pulled off. Maybe, it's better off sticking to car chases and a lot less...ambition in story.",nvjs,2013-03-18,2013
7.0,great movie,"Fast And Furious is a great movie with a well developed storyline that takes the Fast and the Furious franchise back to where it belongs. They clearly realize that these movies are better off with the same people,in the second one it was only Paul Walker with a main role and in the third the cast is completely different. I found this one much better,even better than the first in my opinion,it seems more mature and focuses more on a good story rather than just good car chases,don't worry though,there's plenty of time for that as well. Clearly the Fast and Furious movies can only continue with Vin Diesel and Paul Walker,and from this one forward they realize that,and the fifth only improves.

7.0,roller-coaster ride,"the movie starts of in dominican republic with an action packed heist scene pretty much setting the tone for the rest of the movie which doesn't have much of a plot or a story as such. i have seen only the 1st, 2nd and fourth instalment in the series and have to admit this is better than the second part but not as good as the first part. vin diesel steals the show in this one too with his style humour and persona. 'just like old times' his dialogue from the movie pretty much sums up this flick. paul walker has done a good job in his role of a fbi officer. jordana brewster looks cute. michelle rodrigues doesn't have much of a role in this. looking forward to a fifth part with the same actors.",maheshshetti83,2010-06-07,2010

6.0,"Solid moments of high speed action, but nothing really breathtaking.","The new Fast and Furious movie follows the story of the first movie and brings Vin Diesel back to business. This sounds pretty good, Vin Diesel fits right in for this kind of role and in the first movie he was great. And this is actually a pretty solid movie, one might be deceived by the movie's introduction which sound too unreal even for Fast and Furious standards -- more of Torque standards. Sometimes they just try too hard on first impressions. The rest of the movie flows solidly with a decent story surrounding the action.What attracts most people into seeing this movie is certainly the cars and the crazy thing done with them in the streets, even though I would've hoped for more tuned cars and more crazy drivers running, the content is not bad. Things just got a little cheesier with the narration of the GPS. The excessive use of CGI is also nothing to be proud of, it's never a bad deal to change that absolutely impossible stunt made by computer for another not-that-much but performed in real life.It does serve right for those looking for a movie with the adrenaline at constant high rate. I just wish they would focus more on the mindless action than trying to have something Fast and Furious most likely will never have, a deep complex story. Who knows, if they really focused on what they do right they would provide everything at the right dose and would, even indirectly, add some depth, but still focusing on illegal racing, with an illegal racer as the protagonist.",Marco_AGJ,2009-11-05,2009

9.0,Fast and Furious 4,"Great movie as always. Paul Walker and Vin Disel as always never disappoint and there's lots of great car scenes and plenty of drama, tricks , thrills and spills. If you love this franchise then this is a must see.",btreakle,2020-06-05,2020
6.0,Good fun.,"It's amazing how much better this movie is compared to the series its previous entry ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"". Amazing, since bother movies are made only two years apart form each other and are directed by the same director, Justin Lin.But it's not just that this movie is better, it's also a very different movie. You could say this movie went back to its roots again, since it featured the same main characters and actors out of the first movie, made back in 2001. It's why some consider this movie to be the one true sequel to the popular first movie.And it's really a welcome thing that the actors of the first movie reprise their role in this one. As weird as it might sound, I missed Vin Diesel's star power in all of the sequels. The movie benefits from its presence and it uplifts the movie. The movie feels better balanced out with his presence and it for instance also makes the Paul Walker character work out better, as compared to his role in ""2 Fast 2 Furious"".But it still also actually differs from the first movie as well. You could say that with this entry the series matured more. All of the previous 'Fast and the Furious' movies were made for boys who wanted to be man but this movie is actually for man who are truly man already.It's still a movie with fast cars but the racing aspect gets pushed somewhat to the background. There is actually a story this time around, that involves plenty of action. Not that the story is much good or interesting but it at least makes this movie different from the other ones and in my opinion also better to enjoy.And yes, it really is the action that foremost make this movie such a good and entertaining one to watch. In the previous movie I had a hard time figuring out what was going on half of the time during the races but all of the car scenes in this movie and its action just in general are shot really well and the movie is filled with some spectacular stuff. It's still dumb and big all but it at least is all being brought in an entertaining package.It makes me hopeful for ""Fast Five"".6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Boba_Fett1138,2011-06-14,2011
3.0,The Worst in the Franchise,"Fast and Furious drops the ""the's"", as well as all the fun of the other films. No seriously, this film sucks. With a new director (Justin Lin) who will go on to direct the rest of the movies so far, I figured the direction would change to something perhaps a little more bearable. And while the movie feels more like an action film and focuses a lot more on police politics and revenge, it still can't find a balance between story, action, and racing.Dom's girlfriend Letty is murdered and Dom returns to California to get revenge. Brian O'Conner is trying to solve this case as well, leading him to a cartel he has to embed himself in, much like the second movie. But Dom's doing the exact same, leading to a confrontation between the estranged friends.I appreciate that the movie ties into all the other ones and manages to create really good continuity, but everything else sucks. The action has way too much CG to be appealing, even the driving sequences. You can see a focus on ridiculous stunts over high-octane racing. Partway through there is one good race, but everything else is so dependent on CG backgrounds that it doesn't work. The final scene especially could have benefited from some real stunt work.The story, what seems like it could be a good revenge plot, is instead another weakness. The bad guys are lame and two dimensional; the main characters are hardly developed beyond what they were in the first film. The action is so sparse and so lame it's hardly worth the price of admission. The adrenaline you'd expect just isn't there.Describing Fast and Furious as flat is an understatement. The movie is so flat it's driving on its rims. And that's sad because there was potential here.",sn319,2014-12-06,2014
7.0,Real franchise starter,"This is probably the first film from the franchise I saw and it does feel like this is setting up to be a real franchise while the three films before all kind of felt stand-alone in some way. This is as good as the first one in my opinion even though it moves away from what made the first one a bit special and leaned into the more glossy aspects but it works very very well here. The action setpieces are all wonderfully done but the editing bogs this down a bit. It kinda felt like they are too focused on making it feel tightly packed that they edited out a lot of important stuff. The last chase scene especially felt a bit weird with the editing and there were many moments where the events and timeline felt a bit off which I assume is due to editing out stuff that should've been in there. But it is a very entertaining movie and if not for the editing issue, I would have put it above the first one.This is also where the retconning in the franchise started. Han came back to show Tokyo Drift would be happening after this. But that event and all the main character motivations in this movie coming back in the future to get retconned again seems really lazy from here when I think about it because when I saw them randomly I didn't even remember most of it. Let's see how the franchise holds up now.",Jithindurden,2023-04-28,2023
6.0,Lower in standard in comparison to original,"'Fast and the furious' from 2001 was a trend setter. The movie not only had a routine plot but introduced the theme of street racing so beautifully to the screen. It incorporated a story as well as satisfying racing and action scenes. Rob Cohen presented the movie with such style and the computer graphics seemed natural. This is the fourth movie in the series, which in my opinion should have been the sequel. Justin Lei has directed the movie with his style and has avoided replicating what the previous directors did in the series. I'm sure that his career will sustain in the long run if he continues at this rate. He has made the movie on a more mature scale however the MTV style is very evident throughout. C.g.i is implemented at a large amount. Unfortunately the quality of it is quiet poor in contrast to how it appeared in the previous movies. This made many of the action scenes appear cartoonish that one could not avoid noticing it. Once again the audience is presented with the same routine theme of drug dealers and smuggling. This was also the main theme in '2 fast 2 furious'. This time round there is not a different perspective on viewpoint to the plot. The writing has more substance and the plot is more thicker. Walker once again takes on the role of the infiltrator who has to bring to justice a dealer who is bringing in high quantities of illegal substances from Mexico. I could not understand why there was less emphasis given to the action scenes as this is what the whole franchise is about. The movie contains 4 chase scenes. However in three of them the quality is lacking. They are shot in dark surroundings and the clarity is quiet poor. However the underground scenes were impressive. The first scene is truly outstanding and exciting to watch. SPOILERS The movie begins with Vin and Rodriguez risking it again with attempting to take tankers of gasoline with the assistance of a few friends. After a failed attempt Toretto decides to stay low for a while and go underground. He is later shocked to discover that Letty was murdered. He returns to LA and meets his sister Jordana who takes him to Letty's crash scene. His lead takes him to a drug dealer that Walker too wants to apprehend. They both decide to join forces and infiltrate in to his gang by taking part in street race. At a drug deal they plan to get him arrested. But it does not work out. The dealer escapes. However his love interest gives Vin his whereabouts information. END OF SPOILERS. Upon viewing the movie one will feel that they are watching a undercover cop movie. But without a doubt that is what this is. More attention is given to the story than on the action. The content is high on the cop versus bad guy scenario. The highlight is without a doubt the first scene. The enjoyment element was at a high point. I had wished that the movie sustained with that same level. The emotional impact that the characters have experienced through the first movie is very clearly depicted here. They are not youngsters anymore and are managing to adapt to a normal livelihood. But personal intentions bring them altogether to face danger. The director has given a good effort and the movie has been directed to standard. However it does not quiet manage to surpass the original. It will always remain superior in the franchise. The movie reunites the four characters from the original. But the on screen chemistry does not sparkle to a large extent. Jordana Brewster gets limited scope and there is neither a scene where she is behind the wheel. Her involvement in the plot is limited to nothing. Michelle Rodriguez has two scenes. As she was a huge asset in the original I was hoping to see more of her. I could not understand why the writer had to give her such a brief appearance. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are at the centre of the movie. But Vin was very calm in many of scenes and does not show much enthusiasm in his acting. He was not displaying the usual intensity which is evident in many of the roles which he has done. However in the driving department he performs to the best of his ability. Overall this is a commendable effort but a true fan of the original will be slightly disappointed with action scenes as they do not contrast high in quality with the original. Plot wise there is more development.",Hysteria28,2010-07-29,2010
6.0,Sporting Braga,"Fascinatingly, after two sequels with lower budgets and diminishing returns, for whatever reason, the Fast and Furious franchise switches gears (pun intended) and starts us down the road towards the wild and crazy world we're in now. This one is still relatively tame, but watchable enough.When Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is killed, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) returns to Los Angeles to investigate. Also investigating is Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) who is now an FBI agent looking into the operations of a Drug Kingpin Braga whom Letty was working for when she died. Both Brian and Dom attempt to infiltrate the cartel, using Ramon (John Ortiz) who finds drivers for Braga, as their route in. There is only one spot on the team though, and they must race to decide who gets it.So yes, it's all still relatively lacklustre at this point. They're no longer knocking of DVD players, but the villains are still just drug dealers rather than limitless international terrorist organisations. Dom's already getting into superhero mode though, as he's shot at one point in this and just shrugs it off. Despite saying it's relatively grounded there are three characters in this film who will come back from the dead at some point in the series! There main four characters are all back though, along with Han, who heads off to Tokyo after the opening scene - making this a prequel to Tokyo Drift - an idea which was again retconned later on. Gal Godot joins the cast as Gisele though there's little in this particular performance to suggest that she would be coming back again after the end of this plot. Laz Alonso is also in the film, as Braga's right hand man Fenix and though he has a memorable death, he gets to do a lot more as Mother's Milk in ""The Boys"".Even with all that awful Pitbull Music, the film isn't bad and is watchable enough. The stunts are getting better and the characters are starting to accumulate into ""the family"" that will feature in the next six films. Onwards to ""Fast 5"".",southdavid,2023-06-24,2023
6.0,Slightly better than the original,"You have to give Paul Walker and Vin Diesel credit. They are what make these movies a little less painful to sit through. I made a silly promise to myself that I would watch the entire box of the first six movies and I am a little less sorry now, than after I watched the first film. Although, as I stated before, the series is not high art by any means, but you really have to admire the craft that went into it. The tone of the movie is very serious compared to the others, excluding the first race which is more of the same silliness that you seen from the other movies. The plot revolves around the one man against a much more powerful opponent (like most Clint Eastwood movies or also many westerns). Diesel plays it for all it's worth, but the story around the revenge plot is unfortunately a very dull experience. We are introduced to many stereotypes throughout and references to the earlier films. I just lost interest in this commentary. What is there more to say. Watch this and judge it for yourself. I thought it was a terribly dull experience, although the lead actors do a very nice job, sans one or two perhaps.",policy134,2015-07-12,2015
8.0,overhated,"""Fast & Furious"" is slightly below the levels of the first three films. Everyone says that this fourth chapter of the saga is a total flop, a bad movie...but I say the opposite. For me Fast and Furious 4 is a great movie, fun and never boring. This is the first film of the new era of the saga, no longer focused on illegal car racing but rightly implements a great change: it becomes an action film, with shootings and much more, always giving more space to cars. According to many the choice to make the saga become an action franchise is bad but I think it's perfect: imagine a saga that for 10 movies always brings the same story about the illegality of motor racing. Well, I would say that it would be quite boring. The plot of the film is the thing that convinced me the least, I think it loses a lot compared to previous films. In contrast, however, I loved the difficult situation that there is between the family Toretto and Brian, but with a nice journey together during the film: the two are a phenonemal couple and together they work perfectly. I also loved the dramatic side of the film with Toretto tight-knit by the police about to get to him. I really liked the direction of Justin Lin that after ""Tokyo drift"" reconfirms with excellent action scenes. I think Vin Diesel improves his performance and with him Brian becomes even better in my opinion. I liked the inclusion of Gisele played by the beautiful Gal Gadot. I liked the film's antagonist, Braga, played well by John Ortiz. The film's photography is still excellent in this fourth chapter. The ending of the film really gets me excited about the fifth film, which I can't wait to see again..

6.0,I know it'll get better than this but I was somewhat let down...,"I'm watching all of these movies since my friend recommended them to me since Fast X just came out. The first two were just okay, and so was this one. I just couldn't really get that into it. While this may not be the case with some people, I find these characters to be mostly shallowly written and I just don't really care about them. The action in these films is easily the best thing about them, and there were a couple of pretty cool scenes with Vin Diesel toward the end which I enjoyed. I also liked the presence of some actresses like Gal Gadot and Jordana Brewster too. That's about it though, but I'll try to keep watching. I know that the action at least can for sure get better and better! Just a question of when I will start to actually care about the characters and story.",SPZMaxinema,2023-06-06,2023
8.0,An Entertaining Film,"Fast & Furious is a directed by Justin Lin and written by Chris Morgan. It is the sequel to The Fast and the Furious (2001) and the fourth installment in the Fast & Furious franchise. The film stars Vin Diesel, Late Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, John Ortiz, Gal Gadot, Shea Whigam and Laz Alonso.This film is the fourth installment of fast and Furious series and for the best amongst the four, be it action, acting, screenplay, car chases or stunts, i am also surprised to see such a lower rating of the film because for me this is one of the best film of the four.The plot of the film is average and moreover predictable but the execution of the movie is commendable and will keep you engaged through out the film.The screenplay of the film is fast paced and will keep you glued through out. The screenplay writer deserves a special mention here for the superb screenplay.Acting is great and Vin Diesel and Late Paul Walker had again stole the show with their impeccable acting, Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez were average but effective, John Ortiz was not that effective, rest of the cast were decent. The climax of the film is great and gives a decent closure to the film.Overall an entertaining film with some great stunts.",sauravjoshi85,2021-08-21,2021
4.0,Fast & Furious,"This was the fourth film in the non-stop high octane franchise full of cool and fast cars racing and chasing each other, including lots of action and some stunts along the way, directed by Justin Lin (The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, Fast & Furious 4, 5 and 6). Basically five years after leaving Los Angeles, street racer and thief Dominic ‘Dom’ Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew, consisting of his girlfriend Leticia ‘Letty’ Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez), Tego Leo (Tego Calderón), Rico Santos (rapper Don Omar), Cara Mirtha (Mirtha Michelle) and Han Seoul-Oh (Die Hard 4.0's Sung Kang), are hijacking fuel tankers in the Dominican Republic. Toretto is devastated to hear that his beloved Letty has been killed in L.A., so he returns there to find out what happened to her, whilst there he bumps into his former friend, now enemy, reinstated FBI agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), who is assigned to capture the mysterious drug lord Arturo Braga (John Ortiz). Both O'Conner and Toretto, who finds out Letty was working as a courier for Braga when she was killed, have a shared enemy, they hear that Braga is looking for replacement drivers, so they go undercover to join the gang, of course with their feud reignited this will make trusting each other difficult. From convoy heists to precision tunnel crawls across international lines, all involving fast cars and automobiles, they get close to all of Braga's dodgy dealings, with the help of Toretto's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster), who Brian had a previous relationship with, this also becomes reignited. O'Conner works to find a way to catch the criminal, who is not easy to identify, while Toretto is on a personal vendetta to get revenge on whoever is the killer, who turns out to be Fenix (Laz Alonso), one of Braga's men. Also starring Gal Gadot as Gisele Yashar, Jack Conley as Penning and Shea Whigham as Michael Stasiak. When released in cinemas the title did confuse some viewers, as did The Final Destination (released the same year), because both sounded like the first film in their series, but I suppose you can ignore this. It is good to see Diesel and Walker back in the series following the previous film with neither of them (apart from Diesel's short cameo), and it is good to see Rodriguez get a bit more to do than previously. From the fourth film onwards the series changed in mood and style, it may feel different but in a way it's more modern, the storyline here however is predictable with the usual characters trying to bring down drug dealers. To be honest, the storyline going on is not the thing to pay the fullest attention to, it is the pedal-to-the- metal stuff, all the colourful and cool cars fuelled up, with extra rocket boosters and switches, that speed and crash their way around, and the explosions and stunts along the way keep the pace up as well, the opening sequence and later tunnel chases in particular are most exciting, but the rest of film suffers from dragging sequences and clichés, all in all it's an average action thriller. Okay!",jboothmillard,2012-04-18,2012
8.0,A very good action movie,"We are presented with a good story that is very exciting and dramatic, plus the racing scenes are spectacular, I highly recommend it.",DogePelis2015,2020-11-09,2020
5.0,Does what it says on the tin...,"I have seen all of the previous films in this series on TV, I'm not a huge fan and so I won't go out of my way to watch them. I am, however, a bit of a fan of Vin Diesel, he seems to ooze that certain charisma a film star should have. He appeared in the first of these films, took a bit of a sabbatical for the second and came back for a brief cameo in the third. So it was with some anticipation that I watched the return of his character, Dominic Toretto in this, the fourth instalment. Dom and his gang are in the Dominican Republic and up to no good; they are hijacking fuel trucks to sell the fuel for a profit. Included in the gang is Dom's long time girlfriend Letty. Having just pulled a job they get word that the police are onto them and Dom decides it's best for them to all go their separate ways for a while. They do this until the day Dom gets a call from his sister, Mia, telling him that Letty has been killed. Meanwhile, FBI agent Brian O'Conner, who was featured in the fist two of these films, is investigating notorious drugs dealer named Braga. It seems Braga is using drivers to smuggle drugs across the Mexican border and it was while working for him that Letty was killed. So both Dom and Brian have reason to get in with Braga, Dom, for revenge and Brian, for justice. They both try out as drivers and succeed by one means or another. It's now a case of how do they get to the illusive Braga. I'll leave my little summary there or I'll give the whole plot away! This is a pretty well made film with lots of car stunts and quite a lot of CGI work that is pretty well done, but does, at times, look a bit like a video game. You'll know what I mean when you see the tunnel chase near the end of the film. As ever Vin Diesel was very good as Dominic Toretto, as was Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner. Honourable mentions go to Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto, Michelle Rodriguez as Letty and John Ortiz as Campos. I'll admit it's not the best film I've ever seen and so it won't be making any of my top tens at the end of the year. But it does what it says on the tin, it's got lots of car chases and there's plenty of testosterone flying about. The chases were exciting and well executed, when they didn't use too much CGI. I can't recommend it very highly, but it is entertaining and it won't tax the grey cells too much. My score: 5.4/10",ajs-10,2010-04-04,2010

4.0,delivers the goods but not much to it,"""Fast and Furious"" is the 2009 sequel to 2001's ""The Fast and the Furious"" - though, apparently, the two definite articles in the title aren't the only things that have gone missing in the follow-up to the original. Absent too is any sense of tension - however slight - that was generated by the fact that undercover L.A. detective Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) wasn't who he appeared to be in the first film's admittedly rather hackneyed storyline. Here former foes O'Connor and bad boy Dom Torreto (Vin Diesel) are working together to bring a heroin dealer - responsible for the death of Vin Diesel's girlfriend and partner-in-crime (Michelle Rodriguez) - to justice. Meanwhile O'Connor may be rekindling the romance he had with Torreto's sister (Jordana Brewster), a woman he spooned then spurned in the earlier installment.Of course, one doesn't go to a movie like ""Fast and Furious"" for the scintillating dialogue, the astute character development, or the Stanislavskian acting. One goes for the nonstop car chases (not to mention the scantily-clad bimbos) and, in that respect, at least, this one delivers the goods, at one point turning the greater downtown L.A. area into a giant pinball machine for souped-up, tricked-out roadsters (though Mexico actually gets most of the hot car action here). But even that becomes fairly mind-numbing after awhile. And the movie itself is instantly forgettable.",Buddy-51,2010-04-18,2010
8.0,Fast and furious,"Fast & Furious (2009) is an awesome Action packed sequel, where The Fast and the Furious (2001) stopped. This is the real sequel to The Fast and The Furious. I love that Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster reprise their roles back to the roots the way they were. This is my fourth favorite best film in the series, this film Is a seat to the edge from the beginning till the end. This movie kept me thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. Sure it's a little far fetched, but who cares?It's a movie, and definitely not as bad as some people are saying. Besides, the point of watching a movie is to escape reality so I don't understand why people complain when movies are not realistic. Provided a cinematic equivalent of NOS to the franchise with a tone shift that helped make it one of the most popular and profitable action series in the last decade. Excellent flick. Much better than the middle two. Just forget those movies happened. This was good balls to the walls action with much better actors with the original 4 back together. Bad idea making 2 and 3 :)Vin Diesel and Paul Walker re team with Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster for the ultimate chapter of the franchise built on speed! When fugitive Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) returns to Los Angeles to avenge a loved one's death, it reignites his feud with agent Brian O'Conner (Walker). But, as they race through crowded city streets and across international lines, they must test their loyalties by joining together to bring down a shared enemy. From big rig heists to precision tunnel crawls, Fast & Furious takes you back into the high-octane world, which lives for speed, drives for the rush and breaks all the rules!""Maybe you're the bad guy pretending to be the good guy.""This film is more about stopping a notorious drug lord Arturo Braga and avenging the murder of Letty (Michelle Rodriguez). This film is set back in Los Angles when everything started, after 5.years of leaving the city of Angeles for Dominican Republic after Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew become a Wanted Fugitives. Letty was murdered when she was mixed up in a drug racers mule cartel. She knew the people who hired her, will double crossed her, while trying to escape the flying bullets she was killed by a drug lord's henchman. That weary angrier Dom (Vin Diesel) brings him back to Los Angeles, to avenge his loved one's death and tracking down Drug Lord Braga and killing him. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), is now an FBI agent, and he is assigned to track down a notorious drug lord named Arturo Braga. Both men faces each other in a final showdown. Braga is looking for a fast drivers that are driving and smuggling trough desert New Mexico drugs. Brian goes again undercover only to find out that he and Dom (Vin Diesel) are been double crossed and set up on the same way that was Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) was.This film is filled with full action, fast cars, full of stunts and beautiful women. Gal Gadot is tremendous as Gisele Harabo it was her first role in this film and she was awesome, she acted the character terrific. Paul walker was the best in this film, finally, finally they did something with the character, he become an FBI Agent which I love that with the character In this movie. I love that Dom (Vin Diesel) at the end of the film didn't run, he surrender and I love how Brian ( Paul Walker) was testifying for him in the court. Seriously this film Kicks ass, although I prefer Fast Five over this Action Flick, but that doesn't mean this film did not do the job right, it did! And this film is highly underrated and criticized by critics. Also Han (Sung Kang) has a small scene in the beginning of this film, that was before they killed the beloved character in The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006).The rating I am giving to this film is 9. Anything below 7 would be ridiculous, if anyone would not say that this wasn't At least A GOOD ACTION FILM! (it is sure as hell",dineshaishu,2019-07-29,2019
5.0,Special Effects need work,"After hearing some recommendations about this movie, I finally decided to watch The Fast & Furious, hoping it would exceed the low standards the previous movies in the series achieved. It aims, it shoots, and misses. The special effects were pretty, but disappointing. With all cars virtually going the same speed (which appeared to be about 50 MPH tops)and cars not damaging the way they should, this movie really bugged me since I do love speed and cars. However, it was nice to see some of the original caste, such as Vin and Paul. The plot still closely intertwined with ""respect of the street"" and this time a hint of revenge, and nothing makes an action movie like the drive for revenge. If you loved the first movie in the series (The Fast & The Furious), then you will probably love this one as well. As for me, this movie isn't my cup of tea and there wasn't too much to love about this movie, which is why it gets 5 stars.",jerm1027-1,2009-08-26,2009
8.0,starts great but ...,"The story focuses drug sellers this time and Paul Walker teams up with Vin Diesel to bring them down. It started great. The plot was as good as such an action movie can have but car scenes were not as good as the first one. There were not so many cars as well. The first movie was great but after that, they started to make the movies just for money. This one was better than the last two though. I must say there was too little surprise and a very predictable end. I couldn't catch the spirit. It is an OK movie as itself but it is definitely not better than the first one. Vin Diesel also looked a bit emotionless. Some dialogs were longer than they should be. The first movie is still casting a great shadow on the new ones I am afraid.",EchoMaRinE,2009-07-21,2009
5.0,"Not the best, but not the worst either","After The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, a sequel with Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster returning was put into production and would not be released until April of 2009.The story sees Dom and his new crew hijacking fuel tankers in the Dominican Republic, but he believes that the police is high on their trail. Meanwhile, Letty is killed in a car accident and this leads into Dominic and Brian coming together once again to find her killer and make him pay.I'm not gonna say this movie was bad, but I kinda hate and love this movie at the same time. What made the action work previously is the car chases and underground racing, but that is still present here, so I can't blame this movie for not having car chases.The over-the-top action is just lazy, except for the climactic car chase at the end of the film and the chase between Brian O'Conner and a criminal at the beginning of the film in Los Angeles. I saw previews of this movie online and on TV and I had mixed feelings when I watched this for the very first time.The music is just cool. I give Brian Tyler a lot of credit, but I don't want to talk about the entire musical score for the film.The acting is kind of a mixed bag of popcorn and gummy worms for me because some of the actors do their job and some of them does not.I give credit to the four main actors who play the four main characters even though Michelle Rodriguez does not have a lot of screen time, she does a very good job. The film saw the return of Sung Kang as Han Seoul-Oh and to tell you the truth, he does a great job. Gal Gadot plays Gisele Yashar and she is a new introduction to the film series, but unfortunately, she does not have a lot of screen time either, but does really good.The villains played by Laz Alonso and John Ortiz are okay, but Laz Alonso was miscast in this film. Nothing against him, but I like him in Stomp the Yard and Jumping the Broom, but this is the only film that I think he did not work. John Ortiz plays Braga in this film and he gives a good decent performance, but even then, it's incredibly over the top.So, overall, I have mixed feelings about Fast and Furious 4, while I like the music, story, action and some of the acting, I can't get over the fact that the Letty Ortiz character was killed off. I give it a 5 out of 10, because they tried their best and I don't think it's as bad as people say it is.Now, if the movie would have been 124 minutes long, it would have been fine.",joshuadrake-39480,2015-04-23,2015
8.0,Fast & Furious rocks!,"'Fast & Furious' is escapist cinema at its very best. The film is gripping, interesting, and most of all entertaining. I enjoyed the movie completely, its a power-packed entertainer. Two Thumbs Up!Pluses of the film: The film is gripping. Oustanding action sequences. Witty and catchy dialogue. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker deliver superb performances. Diesel in is top from, while Walker plays his part effortlessly. The chicks are decent.Minuses: The twist in the tale, arrives to early. I am talking about Diesel's track.On the whole, 'Fast & Furious' rocks. Go for this one!",namashi_1,2009-04-04,2009

10.0,A reunion thats worth attending.,"The first Fast and the furious movie was something like a phenomenon for me as a teenager. It had amazing cars, gorgeous girls and introduced two stars to the mainstream audience, Paul Walker & Vin Diesel. The second film only brought back one of them..and while it wasn't terrible, the vibe and energy from the first seemed to be drained out due to this actors presence missing. I wont even begin to explain my disliking of the third film aside from its direction, because we would be here for hours. Finally, for whatever reason, maybe money, maybe careers not going where they were supposed to, these two guys came back together along with their love interests from the first film..and I, for one, am happy that it went down. The action sequences are top notch, easily the best in the series. The cars are AMAZING..if you are a car guy you will flat out love the choices in the film. The acting is..well, tolerable. I read reviews for this film laughing out loud. It sounded like critics were expecting Slumdog Millionaire. Come on people..its the fast and the furious. It is supposed to be fun, loud and exciting. Not Oscar worthy. I don't want to give away anything like most reviews do because i know fans of the series would rather see it for themselves. It is satisfying and i would say, almost as good as the original. For its action sequences, pace and overall feel..i give the film a 10/10.",furiousneon,2009-04-04,2009
3.0,The Melancholy Sound of Yet Another Car Movie,"I have tried to grasp the understanding of the Fast and Furious movies. An angry man meets an angry woman who meets another angry man, and all of these angry-chip-on-their-shoulder people have to much estrogen or testosterone so they have to fight, drive, cuss, smoke, drink to the death! Oh, I know, let us find the easiest way to make a million bucks. Lets hire some real good actors to do real crappy characters, mix in a little drama with a little action, and some real nice cars, and WOW! A million bucks. If Hollywood ever decides they want to maybe add a story line to a car movie, then maybe I can give that movie a good critique. However, I am one man, most people will continue to watch these movies over and over again, and they won't think a thing about it. This is why the movie business will stay how it always has been. Real crafty movie making, and real ignorant movie goers.",smitda04,2014-02-06,2014

Go to the nearest theater and see it..There are a few minor (plot)holes in the movie but they are easy to ignore because it's simply the best movie of the year in my opinion...This movie is for everyone..Just head out, sit down and enjoy a movie that will blow your mind.. I just think that this movie should have been made before Tokyo Drift but that's my opinion...That's all from me!!!.. Now, go out and see!!!",Michaelj-29,2009-04-03,2009
5.0,Disappointing,"I expected big things from this movie, especially with the poster showing all the original movie cast and the exciting trailer. But disappointing is the exact word that describes this movie for me.The story has never been a strong point of the Fast & the Furious series. Well, neither is the acting for that matter. What is most important is the good amount of orgasmic cars and adrenaline pumping racing on show! But the director probably thought they'd try and give the series a new look. Bad idea.Here's why. The story, if you look closely enough, is littered with loopholes and while that is generally overlooked in a F&F movie, it can't be when it is being given a lot of importance. Vin Diesel probably has just two expressions in his repertoire, and he used them to the fullest in this movie, especially when he was in the emotional scenes.Coming to the action. This is where a F&F movie redeems itself. But sadly there is only ONE proper race in this movie, and 3 other action sequences with cars. Which is disappointing to say the least! When people think about this series, its all about the cars and the racing. But apparently it wasn't for this movie. Even Paul Walker's good guy-tough cop routine couldn't save this movie.I'm a big fan of the series, and if this movie wouldn't have had the cast, then I would have rated it below Tokyo Drift. But it manages JUST enough to better the previous installment. If this would have been some other movie and not a F&F sequel, I probably would have rated it higher. But since it is, I give it 5/10.",sahil-ganguly,2009-04-09,2009
10.0,Fantastic & Fabulous movie,"The movie is awesome man ,just awesome.U cant afford to miss it.I saw this first day first show & liked it very much.Now listening the films OSTs.Vin Diesel delivered his best after a long time.His last movie Babylon A D was a huge flop (in terms of revenue,though i liked his bad a$$ acting as a retired mercenary.In this Vin Diesel delivers his best,he just picks it up where he left off in F&F 1.The story also tries to tie the loose ends & answer some questions which were in the fans minds.Paul Walker also did great job.He added some comic timings in the movie which could make u laugh in some serious moments.I never liked Michelle nor Jordana,so I wont comment on them.Gal Gadot is the new chick whom u should look for ;).IMO shes hotter than other two.Shes the new girl on the F&F series :D Btw don't miss the opening of the movie.Coz start from the beginning,the movie has some great car revving & tire screeching scenes.When u have nice cars,Vin Diesel,Gal Gadot.Do u need a plot? If u want a plot driven go watch The Wrestler or Changeling :P Anyways coming back to the point,this movie deserves a watch at theaters only.Btw this is not the last installment of the series.....at least we can hope so.Rating : I give 4 out 5 Why did I cut the 1 out 5?Coz at the beginning there was Spanish to which no subs was provided :D",spycid,2009-04-03,2009
5.0,has Hollywood lost its ability to come up with a new idea....,"after watching this movie, it would appear so. I really liked the first F&F; it was really neat with all the cool cars and driving stunts and it at least had a descent story line. Now with this sequel, there was absolutely nothing new. The cars aren't near as cool and the story line is trash. Vin Diesel was an up and coming star in the original. Now, his career has gone no where and he's forced to be in this sequel when he thought he was too good to be in the second sequel. And Paul Walker is certainly a looker, but his acting ability has gotten him no where as far as starring in big films. His line delivery is as bad as ever in this.FINAL VERDICT: Very disappointing when compared to the original. I wouldn't care to watch it again.",MLDinTN,2010-02-28,2010
8.0,"A Fun, Fast Ride!","While this second movie of Vin Diesel's ‘Fast and Furious’ Trilogy did not impress me as much as its predecessor, ‘The Fast and The Furious’  did, it was definitely worth my money and time, I thoroughly enjoyed every speeding second! The film will meet your expectations of a good plot, witty humor, fast cars, sexy people and down-to-earth fun, and might even have you gripping your seat in a few of the fast-paced driving scenes. While this second movie does not have as many awesome cars as the first film, ‘The Fast and the Furious’ did, it still keeps you wanting more of the unbelievable yet awesomely choreographed driving and action sequences it boasts throughout the entire movie. Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew are back in action once again, ready to kick butt and take names in the second of what will be three great, fun-filled movies, so if you enjoyed the first film, I definitely recommend you see this one!",limelybean,2009-04-04,2009
5.0,Fasten your seatbelts.,"The latest installment in the high-energy Fast and Furious brings back the original cast to the franchise that made them stars. The result - the strategy paid off, this outing is the best of the sequels, and I find myself wondering whether this is the best F&F movie. It's a good, VERY solid, no-holds-barred action movie.While the plot may be a slight rehash of 2 Fast 2 Furious, it's (mostly) the cars who steal the scene here. Like most of it's predecessors, the cars move through busy streets and off-roads like a hip-hop dancer. Let the cars do the talking, I say. The producers thought it would be a good idea to bring Justin Lin back on board as director after Tokyo Drift, up until now the most carefully shot of the franchise. Well, his kinetic and lively direction paid off, and he's an action director to look out in the future. The cinematography is wide in scope and the editing rarely at times feels rushed and pulls you into the film without force. The music from Brian Tyler (again from Tokyo Drift), also fits the moments. There is a number of action sequences, and while some may find the number of actual illegal street races little (one, in fact) disappointing, fear not, as the other action scenes with cars in them more than make up for it, especially the final action sequences. There are obvious moments of CGI, though, but Lin and his crew pull it off in a way it makes it enjoyable.Most of the actors, for most of the time, do NOT out-act the cars. In fact one returning star's character is underused and another's wasted. But the two REAL leads steal the show (barely) from the automobiles, namely Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto. Since he's producer as well, he makes sure when the cameras are on him, they show his X-factor potential to the fullest. What made Diesel into a bankable action hero is proved here, he has a tough body, a macho voice, and a charming personality to boot. This, is his TRUE comeback to mainstream action after the laughably inept Babylon A.D. Fans of Diesel would be glad to know he's back kicking a lot of ass in the film. It's almost ""The Vin Diesel Kicks Ass Show"". The other actor almost stealing the limelight is Paul Walker, the other lead, who seems to be more aggressive in his role as Brian O' Connor. Who could blame him? The first F&F was meant to make him into a bona-fide star, Vin Diesel stole the limelight from him. This is evident in his post F&F movies (Running Scared (2006), anyone?). Anyway having Vin & Paul back together makes all the difference, as they portray characters in which anyone can root for.So for a fast paced, popcorn munching good time, , buckle up and hang on for a Universal thrill ride. What the story lacks, it more than makes up with it's cast, it's action, and most importantly, it's cars. Girls, cars, and bling, oh my! It's the best of the sequels, and it may be the best in the series.Entertainment value: 9/10Overall: 6.5/10",dvc5159,2009-04-08,2009
8.0,Way Better Than Expected,"A friend of mine convinced me to go to this movie on opening night. I gave in, figuring that it couldn't be too bad of a movie. Pretty much, right off the bat I was glued to it. Soo much happens in the beginning. Like the opening scene for example, when they're stealing the gas. Then to kick it off and give the movie a plot, Vin Diesels girlfriend gets killed off. They really thought this one through, this time. The action is great. Amazing cars and high flying. The ending is excellent. I like how they pull off the first scene idea, in the ending scene. VERY well done. I thought it'd be good. It was great! 8/10",canadian_roughneck,2009-04-05,2009
5.0,All show and no go,"""After three high-octane rides on the street racing scene, the fourth film in the ""The Fast and the Furious"" series features a departure from the flashy, overblown colors, obvious CGI-enhancement, and at times over-the-top stunts of the previous two films. With ""Fast & Furious"" the series returns to its roots with a grittier, more realistic leaning tone and reunites the primary players from the original film's cast of gear-heads for more high speed mayhem. "" Ummmm No? Quite the opposite. This is why I disliked the new movie... It was TOO over the top with the fake car chase scenes. FAST AND FURIOUS 1 was great because it was about the cars, the tuners, the culture with real driving and REAL chases and much less CGI. The second one was horrible, just horrible. The third, with Tokyo and drifting gave me hope for the franchise thinking that they were finally doing things right (aside from the whole high school beginning). Now with the 4th and it's unrealistic car chase scenes, OVER THE TOP unrealistic fake chases *i.e. Through the mine tunnels??? WTF is that? Give me a break. Horrible voice acting (direction) and lines were cheesy. Seems like they were trying to add old snippy lines from the first one to make it work, but it didn't... Busta..They should have done away with the writers for this and given it back to Craig Lieberman or someone more into the culture of tuning cars. They had all the nice flashy cars in the movie but the depth and the technology was just not there. What made the first F&F work was the culture aspect of it. Which they could have EASILY incorporated. In my opinion if they did away with the fake CGI car chases scenes and put more depth in the tuning, street races, car culture. It would have hit that sweet spot that it needed.If you drove around the various theaters on opening night you would see the parking lots filled with tuner cars, every kind you can think of. Why? Because the original, and when they walked out I'm sure they were disappointed, just as any true car fan would be, as I was.",skalife187,2009-07-27,2009
10.0,Great Movie.....Feed the need for Speed,"This is a great movie. Vin and Paul come back, Michelle and Jordana are still there it was great to pick up where everyone else left off at. Sure that in the time since Brian (Walker) had found out that its been Dom (Diesel) ripping off the trucks that he had gone off to Miami to bring in drug lord and recover missing money. Then the whole series takes off to Tokyo where it had nothing to do with the original cast or the original plot. Dom is kicking it down in the Dominican Republic with Letty (Rodriguez) pulling the same stuff they did in L.A. Dom leaves to save Letty but she ends up getting murdered by the new gang in town headed by a Columbian drug Cartel. The Charger/Challenger (not sure which one Dom has) makes it comeback only to get destroyed once more. Other than the typical Brian working for the government to bring in the bad guy and having a love affair with Mia (Brewster) in the process while still trying to save Dom...this movie was great. Fast cars, hard hits, hot women....this one returns to the true F&F fashion of feeding the need for speed.",gothicraige,2009-04-04,2009
5.0,A step up for Toretto and company,"After the massive disappointment of the two sequels to 2001's dumb but entertaining The Fast and The Furious, the franchise got itself back on track by grounding itself (I use that term loosely) and bringing back the original quarter of Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster. Tokyo Drift (2006) was mind-dumbingly dull, but the action scenes were more impressive than what came before and it teased fans of the series by bringing back Diesel for a last-minute cameo. Director Justin Lin is at the helm once again, and this fourth instalment is the best yet (at this point in the series).Five years after fleeing Los Angeles, Dominic Toretto (Diesel) is up to his old tricks in the Dominican Republic with girlfriend Letty (Rodriguez) and Tokyo Drift's Han (Sung Kang). Sensing his presence in his new gang will only bring the law down upon them, Toretto flees to Panama, leaving Letty behind. A few months later, Toretto is brought back to America by an incident I cannot reveal with being spoilerific. He starts his own investigation, which leads him to a man named David Park (Ron Yuan). Meanwhile, F.B.I. agent Brian O'Conner (Walker) is also investigating Park, and all trails seem to lead to a mysterious drug lord named Arturo Braga.Though the movie begins with a rather ridiculous action scene that brought flashbacks of the terrible xXx (2002), things settle down as an actual plot - the first of the series? - develops. It's simple but effective, and everything from the cinematography to the script feels cleaner and more mature. More focus is granted for the characters, and although they're relatively stoic and wafer-thin, it's nice to see them exchange words in a room rather than shouting at each other over the noise of an engine. Fans of the franchise need not to worry though, as Fast & Furious, which is in danger of being the most unimaginative title to a sequel ever, offers plenty of motor-porn, scantily-clad women and a pumping soundtrack.Which is where the movie ultimately suffers. Although Justin Lin dims the sheen of street racing and shoots the obligatory gyrating lady parts with a less perverted and exploitative eye, the main crux of the plot still surrounds drug smuggling, a lazy McGuffin and a recycled excuse to get Brian and Toretto behind the wheel again. The action on the whole is exciting, especially the high-speed rush through an underground tunnel that crosses the Mexican-American border, and Lin manages to avoid getting lost in the mayhem. It will never be a work of high art, but there's enough here to reignite my passing interest in this glossy but fun series.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",tomgillespie2002,2015-01-29,2015
8.0,The best in the franchise?,"When i first heard that the all of the actors from first movie will appear and of course Vin Diesel as well, i had high hopes for this one. I mean after Tokyo Drift (which i did like a lot, in spite of the story,thanks to the vision of Justin Lin about the franchise should be) it could only mean good things for the fourth part.Right? I got in the cinema really hyped about the movie after seeing the trailer and of course for Justin Lin directing it and not to even mention all the good actors - Vin,Rodriguez,Walker. Vin Diesel is a must have in the Fast &Furious franchise, without him is just like seeing Harry Potter movie without Daniel Radcliffe. All actors performed well in the movie especially Vin who has a very cool-hero bad ass type. Brewster played the role of the younger sister as it should,Rodriguez represented his role a bit different from the first and the last but not least Walker, who has his role like a glove, he does even look like a cop what the hell. Justin directed very well, with lots of effects, cool racing scenes, brings out the most he can from actors, what i didn't like was that they're wasn't so much exotic cars or imports,i really wanted more cars and more racing scenes,don't get me wrong there is some really good racing scenes,but i wanted more .... but in the end is a really good and entertaining movie even for those who hadn't seen all 3 FnF.I would really like if they make a fifth in the franchise especially that things will only go only interesting, you will understand why i say this after you've seen the whole movie.I recommend this movie! Seat back and enjoy the ride 8/10",stelian_blidar,2009-08-14,2009
2.0,lazy and phoned in,"I thought this was the first movie and honestly wanted to see the appeal as in middle school or really early high school it seemed you HAD to see this movie.. well.. I watched the wrong movie first in the series. How did anyone think this was a good idea to call the movie ""fast and furious"" instead of coming up with some clever name. If some other studio put out a movie they'd run to their lawyers and sue.Vin Diesel is so boring in this movie. It's like he doesn't want to be there. He just mumbles through every line for a pay cheque. How could anyone want him to be a leading man? What's his appeal? Does he look ""legit"". He looks like a mixture of Ron Pealman which many of you may know from Sons Of Anarchy or Hellboy. As well as Bruce Willis or Steven Seagal. He can't act to save his life.The plot is so uninspired even if I spoiled it, it doesn't matter, it's that dull where a hundred movies have done a similar plot but better. There are a few cool car chases but it just SCREAMS direct to video especially how many scenes are recycled. They heavily rely on some tunnel. The cars weren't very impressive and the worst thing going for this movie is the dialogue seems like it was written by someones 14 year old son. The last time I saw insults back and forth that bad was in middle school. The cars are forgetful other than the green one the bad guy (i think) drove and of course whatever greasy car Vin could get his mitts on.Skip this one.",talllwoood13,2022-05-26,2022
10.0,Well worth the $6.50 that I spent at the matinée.,"For one thing? There was the action-packed prologue. It had stunt work worthy of a James Bond movie. And, more importantly, it had a rare case of faithful continuity. Not only did Michelle Rodriguez return to play Letty. Sun Kang (as Han) was back, too!* *Making it appear that it was set a year or two before F&F: TOKYO DRIFT. Another thing this sequel had going for it was the return of Paul Walker, as Brian, and Jordana Brewster as Dom's sister, Mia. Eva Mendes was undeniably nice to look at, in 2F/2F. And, I'm sure, as Agent Fuentes, she provided a great release for any sexual tension Brian might have felt. But, Brian and Mia had much better chemistry! They proved this when they had their dramatic reunion in that little diner. I was wondering what he'd say when she demanded an explanation for his emotional betrayal of her. And, I was not disappointed. As far as I'm concerned, Brian's reply was delivered with complete believability! Of course, the _best_ thing this sequel had going for it was the return of Vin Diesel to straightforward action-adventure! Oh, he proved he could do light-hearted, family-friendly spoofs of it in the Disney flick, THE PACIFIER. But, I suspect the main reason he appeared in that film was just for the sake of professional variety. To prove he wasn't just a Right Said Fred look-alike who could take a punch (and dish it back out, twice as hard). So, if you haven't already seen it, go for it. The only way you could dislike it is if you disliked the first three movies in the franchise, as well.",Carycomic,2009-04-05,2009
5.0,A Fast and Furious Comment,"Readers beware this is not a movie you'd expect from it's origin. The whole racing world got turned upside down and into a cat and mouse chasing film. I seriously do not feel that it has a good story and there were moments where things didn't add up or make any sense. If you want to watch a good movie about racing then I'd suggest you look into Japanese Anime, about a movie by the name of Initial D. Now that's a true tuner movie, great story line and great music. This Fast and Furious movie is going to be forgotten real fast by all it's viewers. Hell, even Midnight Club had a better story line. Guess it's really not a racing film, it's more like nice action, nice girls, nice cars, but poor story because where's the racing? 1 race just doesn't cut it man.",nagrain,2009-08-07,2009

3.0,such a waste of time.,"The first two of these were horrible, the third part was OK and now were back to sucking again. Justin Lin is back directing and he did pretty good on Tokyo Drift and he and writer Chris Morgan seemed to put life into this series, but here they basically took all that sucked and ruined the first two and put them into part four. The horrible cast returns, Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster. I like Michele Rodriquez but sadly she wasn't here but a short period of time. They also featured Sung Kang from part 3, which proves this movie took place before part three, as Kangs character died in Tokyo Drift. The only new member I liked was Greg Cipes playing a small role. This time, Diesel goes back to L.A. after his girlfriend (Rodriquez) is killed he is on a mission to find out who did it. Meanwhile, Walker is now an F.B.I. agent and he's after the same guy for other reasons and he and Vin end up becoming (you guessed it...) drivers for this bad guy. and then blah blah a bunch of junk, seen it all before yadda yadda BORING. Lin might direct drifting well, but he sucked directing these races, it had no real hardcore action, focused way too much on character and was pretty much the same stuff you would expect. I wouldn't recommend it..part 3 is the only one worth watching 3/10",pkzeewiz,2010-04-16,2010
8.0,Fuel injected fun!,"Fast and Furious rallies up the high octane in speed and performance. Vin Diesel is back from the ""Tokyo Drift"" scene, and is badder than ever. He's hardcore, and very vengeful in this sequel. The reason is when his lover and fellow racer, Letty(Michelle Rodriguez) got killed, and Dominic(Diesel) wants the killer, BAD! Along with the FBI Agent, the action has just began. The agent was involved in other races in the past, he's ready to join the fun again. To me, the real stars of the movie are the cars, in my opinion. I liked the Chevelle SS, The Mustang Corbra, the Dodge Charger, and several others in the making. I liked the desert scene where the the drug cartel and the drivers battled it out. Pleny of WHAM! BAM! & BOOM! It's a shame when Dom gets life without parole, I think the judge should be impeached. This movie is non-stop all the way, it never lost its value whatsoever. This movie is for adrenaline junkies of all sorts. 3 out of 5 stars!",GOWBTW,2009-04-24,2009

10.0,Back to the roots ?,"So, first off, I was truly not expecting to watch a great movie here. Had low expectations, maybe because in my opinion ""Tokyo Drift"" was not a good movie at all. Friend of mine previously watches it on the cinema, and told me it was a good movie after all, so I decided to give it a try and to watch it. In the first 5min of it, it truly takes your breath away! So much action going on, so great ideas, and a great plot, that lets you truly guessing what comes next. The cast is brilliant once again (First Movie), and the Action is just overwhelming, if just makes you feel like you driving, and in the middle of the action. If you love speed, and you love race movies, you gonna love this. Even if you just like action, or looking for a good story, go and watch it! This is so far the best from the Fast and Furious series. And if they decide to make another one (what I think they will after this brilliant movie), I think it's gonna be very difficult to surpass this one! If by all this, you still can't decide if you should watch it or not, just watch the Trailer in HD! If you liked it, then you gonna love the movie! I give it a 10! this is so far the best movie of the year! And believe me I watched a lot! Excellent movie, from the beginning till the end!",znox85,2009-04-11,2009
5.0,Mindless Escapism,"This is my first experience of the Fast & the Furious franchise, and I have to say I found it an dumb, but fairly entertaining experience. Fast & Furious takes place after the first and second films, but before the third: an interquel which is a very rare thing, even in Hollywood.The action starts of in the Dominican Republic, Dom (Vin Diesel), Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and Han (Sung Kang) are stealing petrol so they could sell it on the black market. The heat is on them and they all have to go their separate, Han going to Tokyo, Letty to America and Dom goes to Panama city. Brain O'Connor (Paul Walker) is an FBI agent who is working on a case to bring down a Drug Cartel who import heroin from Mexico to America using tunnels and street racers. Letty ends up getting murdered by the same Cartel and Dom and Brain work together to bring the group down.The plot is ridiculous, it's thin and is not the way a Cartel would work. I can not picture tunnels being build under the American/Mexican border without the American authorises knowing or the tunnels being big and stable enough to drive cars in them. The acting is standard, no one really stands out for the right or wrong reason. Vin Diesel is the strongest performer. What makes the film work is the action sequence and the director Justin Lin does it with joy. There are some good races, and other action set piece, including shoot-out, which action-junkies would enjoy. However some scenes, especially the race in Korea Town, felt like it was trying to be Grand Theft Auto the movie with the way the cars were driven the GPS graphics. The action scene in the beginning reminded me of the petrol stealing scene in Mad Max. But the action is the strongest point of the film. In the UK the film has a 12A rating (PG-13 in America), but personally though the film should have gone for a 15 (R) rating because it wouldn't really affect it audience, and allow the filmmakers to show more sex and violence. As well Justin Lin really like to show girls kissing each other (I wonder why).Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster were all in need of hit after some unsuccessful career moves. Vin Diesel was doing some really after films, Paul Walker only has Flags of Our Fathers to his credit and Michelle Rodriguez only did a year on Lost. Its good to see Vin Diesel backing doing what he does best.The people who will enjoy this film the most are men who masturbate over cars and women (in that order).",freemantle_uk,2009-04-18,2009
9.0,Maximum Score: A,"As a fan of the Fast and Furious series, I have to say that I'm surprised how good this film is. They managed to include all the original characters in this film and the plot really really fit with the dialogue. And the actors/actresses play the roles so well that it'd make you think this is so real. I really love the series and especially this movie because the action was great and each time Justin Lin makes a movie, he made sure that it's perfect. BTW I think Paul is like awesome with his acting and stuff, but in this movie, he was just a little off. Visit www.moviereviewsof2009.blogspot.com for more.

5.0,Not compelling or interesting,Fast and Furious tries but ultimately fails to make a compelling/interesting story despite having a rather unique and intricate setup compared to some other entries into this franchise.,eaganv-49896,2022-07-31,2022
8.0,An Excellent Addition to An Already Exciting Series,"Well going into the fourth part of the franchise, there are two kinds of people that have watched the series, those who really loved the movie and those who write smut just to dampen people's spirits so that they're persuaded by those hacks to hate the movie. ‘Fast and Furious’ exceeds everything ‘Tokyo Drift’ ever stands for, and even surpasses the original and its awful sequel ‘2 Fast 2 Furious’ which was nothing but a showcase of chase scenes and nothing more. This movie is a prequel to ‘Tokyo Drift’ and is a follow-up to the events from the first movie by approximately five years. Unfortunately, Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is thrown in the slammer for freeing conman Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel)and how this lead to the sequel is beyond me. During that time Dom and his squeeze Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) have settled in the Dominican Republic doing what they do best high-speed hijacking which shifts into an exciting opening scene where Han (Sung Kang) gets involved leading to the events in ‘Tokyo Drift’ even before the movie gracefully commences. A death tragically lures Dom back to Los Angeles where he once again encounters Brian who's back with the FBI and here we go again, another series of fast-paced chases and bringing down the bad guys. The antagonist in this story is a drug dealer on the run that Brian is in hot pursuit of. The dealer relies on street racer drivers to do his evil deeds. At first Brian and Dom are racing against each other, and then collaborate to take down, their adversary. The improvement come into the adjustments in character as Dom and Brian have grown into each other and they levelled the into their maturity level over the years. Walker has become more serious and focused as he's lost that ‘tubular dude’ attitude to a more ‘let's get down to business’ ’persona. To me that's believable after all you think by now he's lost that personality after years of experience. And here I think he has. Diesel who has been in a few duds is welcomed back to the franchise possessing his comfort zone and has become more humane and caring. We know he lives on danger and he knows it himself which makes him less self-serving than even James Bond himself. We see him perform and we can see that he's yearning to be more than just an action hero, though people would rather see him in only those kinds of films rather than to see him actually act. Director Justin Lin is back and delivers the same high-octane energy from the previous instalment adding more fuel to the cars and complimenting the driving effects with eye-candy visuals. And the slower parts don't drain out like what weakened t5he premise of ‘Tokyo Drift'. It's still a few inches short from the first of the series, but it steps up the plate as one the more better of the other sequels. But you had to take some adulation from the first movie to fully appreciate this one, or else you think this just another repetitive action flick.",eric262003,2010-02-15,2010
4.0,The first of these films to be worse than I remember.,"Fast and Furious (2009) is the ramp to what the series would become. From films about racing cars, to action-packed heist ridiculousness. As such, it suffers a great deal. We have a film that's trying so hard to be serious, and in that very same film we have Detective Dominic recreate a car crash and shooting in his mind just from tracks.What's even worse is that the later entries in the franchise retroactively make this film nearly pointless, turning it into a bombastic vehicle to introduce and reintroduce mainstay characters. But I won't take that part into account for this review, it's more a failing of the entire franchise.Fortunately there's some good parts. Less CGI and actual stunts, even if they are completely stupid, make the action more enjoyable to watch. It was also nice to see the characters we learned about in the first film finally interact with each other again, after their brief spin-off sojourns.But, it's not enough to make this film enjoyable for me. The other movies are at least a lot of fun. This one is dour and miserable by comparison. Thankfully, the film after this one is probably the best in the series.",H4wke,2024-11-06,2024
9.0,The the 4th movie is better then the first 3.,I did not the like the first movie of The fast and the furious. I did like 2 fast 2 furious. I also liked fast the furious Tokyo drift. But this is better. Fast five is better. And Furious 7 is also better. This movie has a great story line. It also has great acting. It is very fast past. This is one of the best action movie of the last decade. 6.6 is a good ratting. But this is such a great movie that 6.6 is underrating it. If you like acting movies than you should see this movie. It is a great movie. You should see this movie. It is a great movie. I give it 9. It is so cool. If you like action movies you will like it. This is a very cool movie. See it.,jacobjohntaylor1,2017-04-25,2017

5.0,They had to make something,I don't know what they were thinking with the 3 rd movie it was boring and bland the whole story line was trying something different that was a flop then getting back to what an show the movie should be but this one is still off because of way he leaves everyone to be by himself and then letty starts randomly working for a drug lord that doesn't seem like something they would get involved with.his sister Mia is bland and boring someone else definitely should have played that part vin deisel is half black but he alway seems to avoid having black family in anything he plays he will play any other race but that similar to the rock who embraces his Samoan race but never his black side.the funeral was nothing of importance may as well have not been part of the movie there's no real emotions behind her death at all she was murdered and vin diesel is bland and dry as usual he besides driving the cars vin deisel brings nothing to these movies but a robotic presence Paul walker with all the rest of the cast make the movie. Paul walker always brought a natural presence to all the movies he shows the emotions when needed the toughness the love the bad boy or the cop.he's versatile .its hard to watch the ones he's not in the girls with no clothes get air beat over the top we know everyone loves to exploit woman sex sales draw the crept men in to watch but there's never a element of sexy men for woman this was made to be a guys movie.,tamrbrwn-59647,2024-09-26,2024
4.0,Fast & Furious (2009) Tries to be more serious and loses speed,"Perhaps this will be the turning point of the Fast and Furious franchise. This is where we see the change from a plot that involves street racing to something much bigger, but we are still not presented with more intense action. This is the big problem with the fourth film in the franchise. He cannot maintain the simplicity of the previous ones, but he does not risk the megalomania of the later ones. The film focuses on a drama that cannot carry. Everything that tries to be dramatic in the narrative becomes clumsy. The direction doesn't handle the drama well, the actors don't have the capacity to do it and the entire atmosphere that tries to have a more dramatic and serious aura becomes just cheesy. The film is saved by a few good action scenes that make the experience not a complete disaster, however, there isn't much to save in the film.",claszdsburrogato,2024-01-09,2024
10.0,Great Re-invention of the F&F,"Don't Liston to the Bull from haters. This is a GREAT Movie for the Action racer at heart. It's not about heavy story line or great dialog. It's about the code of friendship, and fast cars with big mucilage.enjoy with that attitude and you will end felling faster and with more ferocity in life.I myself have a 1989 5.0 Mustang and I have it done to the Tees! every time I step into it it relaxes me and to see this movie makes me appreciate it even more. This movie is not about racing it's about a love for a great gift .the gift to make a great car fell like part of the family",merlin6-2,2009-04-05,2009
5.0,A reboot of sorts that brought the main cast back to the series,"The fourth installment of the series brings back the original cast as they take on a Mexican dealer. Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is reintroduced down in the Dominican Republic stealing oil with Lettie (Michelle Rodriguez) and Han (Sung Kang) in a spectacular explosive scene. Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) has rejoined the FBI, solving street-racing crimes and smuggling. When Letty winds up murdered, Dom returns to Los Angeles and seeks revenge. Dom beats up mechanics and O'Conner tracks his mayhem. When Ramon Campos (John Ortiz) hosts a race to interview new drivers to work for the mysterious dealer Arturo Braga, both Brian and Dom enter. Dom beats Brian to earn the job working for Braga. This chase looks great as the special effects are updated. Gisele (Gal Gadot) also works for Braga and finds Dom attractive. Brian also sparks anew his relationship with Mia (Jordana Brewster) though she is still bitter about him lying to her in the original film. Briand has another one of Campos's racers arrested so that he can join the other drivers transporting cargo. They are shipped across the border, given coordinates, and told to follow Fenix (Laz Alonso). They speed down into a tunnel beneath the Mexico-American border. Dom plays his hand, reveals he is on this mission for revenge and blows up all the race cars. Dom and Brian escape with Campos's supply, but then Dom becomes angry when he finds out Letty was working undercover for Brian, who is only able to stop Dom from beating him up when he reveals that she was doing it to gain Dom's freedom.

8.0,Worth a watch,Firstly I would like to state that this movie is after 2 fast 2 furious I know this because it has been five years since Mia last saw Brian we find this out when she is sitting with him in the dinner. also Brian as just been reinstated with the police where in the second movie Brian was on the run from the cops and ends up helping them out thus giving them the opportunity to clear his name and reinstate him also in this movie he is a much better driver as he is in 2 fast 2 furious were at the end of the first movie he is still not that great. Now for a quick review this movie definitely has a different feel to its predecessors. It is much more about the people in it appose to the cars. The cars in this movie I would have to say are the worst out of all the movies. Unless you're in to old American muscle. The only car I really liked was the Skyline R34 the Subaru was just ugly. Other than this I thought the movie was great it was nice to see that the story had taken a different turn we didn't have the norm. We now have two paths the one of Dominic who is after Fenix for the murder of Letty and then we have Brian working for the cops trying to bring down Campos while at the same time trying to keep Dominic out of jail. The end of the movie was great and leads the way for the 5th. If you are a Fast and Furious fan you really need to see this one as it is a must see.,alan_robinson,2009-04-16,2009

8.0,Original parts = original fun,"The 4th film in the F&F franchise is a winner. Bringing back the original cast (well, most of them) was the only way to keep the franchise going. The previous films were not ignored, but were expanded on here. The film starts out with a great chase sequence (which is to be expected here). We are then given an acknowledgment to the 3rd film, which leads us to believe this is what happened back home when Han left to head over to Tokyo. The film plays out pretty much like you think it would. We are given some intrigue this go around with Dom and Bryan (now working with the FBI)trying to track down the people who have killed a mutual friend. This leads to Dom and Bryan going into a new kind of car scene, that of drivers running ‘packages’ back and forth across the Mexican border. A total compliment to the previous 3 films. It will be interesting to see how they bring the 5th film to fruition. There is talk of setting it in Europe. It would make sense given that at the end of the 3rd one, Dom is in Japan.",RCWjr,2009-04-16,2009
5.0,Too much of a copy,"The fourth film in the series. Placed, in time, somewhere between the first and the third. I am not completely sure whether this film plays before the second film, or after the second film - both scenarios would work out. Anyway, being the fourth film in the series there is little left to be explained and so the action starts rolling right from the very first seconds of the film and it doesn't run flat until a long while later. The story line is more or less the same as the first film and the roles being played out are much the same too.In fact, that is where this film fails to work out all that well - it is too much of a copy of the original one and although its subtitle is ""original parts"" that really does not make it worth the cinema time - the first film is not so old that there is a whole generation of people between that one and this one. It is not a bad film and for the fans of the series this is a worthy watch but I would have hoped they had done some more work on the story line and a little on the fast pace action - it would have made for a better and more attractive film.5 out of 10 high speed chases",LazySod,2009-05-06,2009
10.0,"the best one since the first, an action packed ride","the first the fast and the furious is one of my fave movies ever, the second one was in my opinion a piece of crap, while i enjoyed the third and loved the ending, i thought it was great for vin diesel to appear in it, and that gave me high expectations for this fourth installment, and did it disappoint, hell no, this is the ultimate sequel to the original movie and it's got a great story and i think dom and Brian's friendship is stronger than ever. now let's get one thing straight this movie ain't really about street racing anymore, this is basically jus a movie about these characters nearly ten years later, and it's fantastic now don't worry it might not be about street racing but it's got enough breathtaking car action it dosen't disappoint, now the story is really about dom's girlfriend letty getting murdered, an event witch pretty much leads to all the cast bieng re united, and kicks off the story, now to me in it's core this is just a vin diesel revenge pic and in many ways it is, but we know these characters we love these characters and the film is action packed from start to finish they have topped the first 3 in terms of action easy, all in all a solid sequel that does justice to the first film and bieng everything a sequel should be, bigger,faster,furiouser its top quality entertainment. vin diesel is back in top form",daworldismine,2009-12-13,2009
5.0,Not the worst but enough bad,"After watching the prequel who is "" Tokyo drift "" who it was very not bad this third opus or this four opus from the franchise it was very disappointing for my opinion.You meet again finally our first protagonist from the franchise debut that was very nice but the script was not gripping then all reason cause the main topic of this film was interesting but I didn't hit the feeling of an entertainment story telling...You getting sometime very boring in front this movie like the secondary opus and often you are losing about the bad character who is him, who is who is disappointedSometimes you are the feeling that is most a cop movie with car than movie car, is disappointedThe action scene are nice but I was the feeling that it was different that usually like you noticed more that fake explosion unlike the precedent opus for me the Vfx was not good but such entertainment scenes of action and it's nice to see back Los Angeles !",tomlaju,2024-04-26,2024
9.0,FF 2.5 - the best in the series.,"Though I was extremely excited about this movie coming out, I honestly it would be somewhat disappointing. But I was very surprised. I absolutely loved how they integrated things from the first movie into it; the old house, the old car, even Dom's cross and leather jacket. It basically brought in things from the first and third movie which is great because the second one was crap, in my opinion. This movie was a lot more emotional and serious compared to the others. Vin Diesel did a fantastic job playing the broken-hearted hero with the tough macho exterior. You could really feel his pain. It was better, I think, than his character in 'A Man Apart' in which he was also seeking revenge. I would have really liked to see more of Michelle Rodriguez, though, just so the four main characters could actually be reunited again. And it would have been nice to see more of Sung Kang. He was basically in it for five minutes, said something about Tokyo and then he was gone. They should have delved more into the history that was touched on in Tokyo Drift. The cars used in this one were also great. But like I said before, it feels like this sequel was more concerned with the plot and emotions involved rather than just the action - not to say that the action sequences didn't make me jump a little. The only thing I would complain about is the ending. It was a nice concept because it echoed the beginning, but it left me with the feeling that nothing was solved in the movie because it put them all right back where they started. Overall: great plot, explosive action, hot boys and hot cars - I give this movie 9 out of 10. :)",n_retandy,2009-04-10,2009
5.0,better then 3nd or 3rd but thats not saying much,This movie was slightly better then the last two installments but by not nearly enough. Im just going to face it the acting in these movies is always going to be terrible so I wont even mention that. The story line is a bit different though so I liked that.This movie is about Brian now working with the FBI he teams up with Dom to try to bring the herion dealer down.I like how they switched up the story a bit and tried to give us something a bit new but for some reason they just cant make these movies worth watching anymore. The action scenes are not even really entertaining.,deatman9,2012-10-21,2012
9.0,Return to be Fast & Furious,"Great to see the four main cast members return for Fast & Furious which has Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto,Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner, Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto and Michelle Rodriguez as Letty. Great to see the series go back to the way it started to bring fans of cars to come see a awesome movie series since The Fast And The Furious came to the box offices in 2001. I have seen all the Fast And The Furious movie and this throw The third movie in the series out the window. The action and cars in Fast & Furious are much improve and kick butt beyond that. The Story has more twist and turns then the others, Dominic is out for revenge and later by a now back in the F.B.I. Brain joins in undercover while trying to rebuild a old love with Mia who he loved in The Fast and the Furious. I like that the writers set up the story so well and make it where you never knew what happens next it just that good. All the cars are awesome from all kinds of Car companies such as GM, FORD, HONDA, TOYOTA, DODGE, and so forth. They really took the Furious and put it into Fast & Furious. If you have not seen this movie yet you must see it it helps rebuild the series and I hope we get another Fast & Furious movie soon enough because this movie helps the movie survive I give Fast & Furious a 9 out of ten A lot has chance, You're right",Terryfan,2009-04-06,2009
4.0,Best in the series so far,"I found that the fourth part was more mature then the ones before. You had the usual racing, no-logic, Little Story, women who willingly offer themselves to anybody and the original cast. But thought it wasn't so dump and flat this time. The actors even... acted from time to time. I liked Vin Diesel very much here. The idea of Brian of beeing a cop and beeing a criminal annoyed me very much. As if no one really had to pay for the crimes they have commited. Well Dom seemed to get like 25 years in prison at the end, which shook me a lot as it ended so abruptly. Sure the Boys and one Girl where about to save him from that... Again the message here: Laws are for the usual People and with a fast car you can just escape?",lythis-love,2019-04-19,2019
9.0,fast and furious,"This movie is the true sequel to the fast and the furious, the second movie was kind of more like a spin off and Tokyo Drift went off track to being a teen movie and I had fate in director Justin Lin doing a better movie than Tokyo drift and in my opinion he did. Fast and Furious is much better than the last two movies. Vin Diesil was meant to be in this franchise, i don't think Paul Walker can carry this movie alone even in the movie self Walker needed help from Vin's character and Vin did most of the work in the end to fed off the bad guys while Walker only handle one villain and that fight scene between Paul and Vin was short but I thought was epic, Vin Diesil face looks like he wanted to murder the dude and I new he was gonna go ballistic.The action with the cars are innovative, stunts with cars you haven't seen before and very entertaining to watch on the big screen, just a little spoiler but when that blue skyline exp loaded I almost cried. There's eye candy for both genders, but mostly guys because the girls in this movie all look like hot models.Critics all say that the plot was dumb, but I thought was it was a normal solid plot to get Paul and Vin's character to work together and it had a little twist to it. Also critics said the story with the characters was not driven as the first movie and I could agree on that because the movie was more a popcorn entertainment flick and if you watch the Fast and the Furious then watch this one Fast and Furious you'll see the difference between the two movies. However I did mind that the movie was like that at all. I had fun with this movie, as and action movie it is a lot better than those other action movies out now like Wolverine and Crank 2 and I'm sure people with like it as well. Looking forward for the next installment, just don't change the characters.",aleexx_1920,2009-05-18,2009
3.0,The first one BORING!,"Even the atrocious Tokyo Drift wasn't boring, it was just bad at everything, insulting even, but not boring. This one tried to have a more complex plot/story, with character development and emotive scenes, but without better actors and written dialogue and without sacrificing any second of ‘car scenes’. It failed. Some of the things kind of worked out: -Toretto solidifies himself as a ‘sensitive good’ criminal with a good arc in the movie, (even if probably a bit forced) -Brian finally goes full on criminal -The plot exists and is dense. There are plenty interconnected subplots that end up in a coherent way. But getting those things right, only provoked bigger problems: -A more complex plot required a lot of boring scenes filled with exposition. -A more complex plot showcased how unbelievable the whole thing is. The FBI in particular felt impossibly fake -A more complex and emotional plot required more acting from Paul Walker and Vin Diesel, and they are just terrible actors. -A more complex plot without any realism and depth and overall point (no social commentary, no ideology, no political discussion) gets boring and takes away minutes and chances for more comedic scenes (more appropriate for this franchise)",educallejero,2019-03-25,2019

I think if you're fan of Fast and the Furious you will not be disappointed at all! I love this movie and when it is out for sale i am going to buy all four parts for my collection.I hope this helps you all and Enjoy!",Chana77,2009-04-06,2009
5.0,"A more dramatic turn, yet not as compelling as it should be.","Well, I didn't really care for this one. Some of the action is good but beyond that I wasn't very swayed by this installment. The big mistake was the way Dom finds out about Letty's death, via phone call. That's what sets up everything for the rest of the flick and you can only see his interpretation of the events through his imagination at the site of her supposed death. For anyone who knows what happens in the following films, this just no longer holds a lot of power. The only truly good moment is where Dom decides to do the right thing and let those responsible be handled by authorities rather than taking another life with vengeance, knowing that it would have never made him feel any better. It's a nice attempt and easily more interesting than the first film, but it just doesn't hold a lot of power.",tmm_8705,2013-06-28,2013
10.0,This movie rocks!,"I have seen all of the movies in this series and i have to say that this 4th installment, fast & furious was my absolute favorite. The movie keeps you on edge,has kick butt cars,awesome music,action-packed stunts and a spectacular cast. I have to say that when Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) was killed i was very upset and found it interesting that Dom (Vin Diesel)had this amazing vision of what happened to Letty when he visited the crash site,i was happy to see that Brian (Paul Walker)and Mia (Jordana Brewster)were back together towards the end of the movie and last i am not sure but from the look of the ending it looks like we might be in for another awesome ride sometime in the future? Safe to say the movie was the ultimate ride!",gryffindorgirl-4,2009-04-20,2009
5.0,More like a video game than a movie,"The latest instalment in a film series that shows no signs of dying out – in fact, with each movie making more than its predecessor, it looks like we're going to be stuck with Fast & Furious films for a long time yet. I'm no fan of racing, and I'm not impressed by speedy or super-powered cars, so I'm in no way the ideal viewer for a film like this. And yet something keeps me coming back to watch each new film in this series, even though the experience is invariably disappointing.FAST & FURIOUS is a mixture of the good and the bad. A couple of opening sequences are evidence of this: the opening heist-on-a-fuel-tanker scene is an example of everything that's wrong with this type of movie. It's cheesy, completely over the top, reliant on dodgy CGI effects for impact and lacking the kind of high-octane realism that made the truck chase at the opening of the Thai film BORN TO FIGHT so good. And yet the subsequent foot chase scene, reintroducing Paul Walker's character, is actually fairly decent, adding a bit of free-running to the mix.What follows is hardly surprising, except in the killing off of a major character that you won't see coming. The ensuing events see Walker and Diesel teaming up one more time to compete in a series of illegal races set around the Mexican border, culminating in a madcap pursuit through miles of hidden underground tunnels. The car chases are the things that make or break these films, and it's unfortunate for me to report that they're too filled with poor CGI to be remotely convincing; the final race is a real disaster, with cars and backdrops all looking animated.Inbetween, there's the uncomfortable spectacle of watching Diesel trying to act, which doesn't really work – he's far better off keeping quiet or hitting things. Walker's always been a bore to me and that doesn't change here, while the villains are particularly bland. A tough fist-fight between Walker and Diesel is one of the highlights, and there are a couple of neat car crash stunts that don't disappoint either, but FAST & FURIOUS is one of those movies you'll forget all about mere hours after viewing. Can't wait for the Rock to show up now, though",Leofwine_draca,2012-04-23,2012
8.0,Not much fast but its entertaining,First of all to start with this movie its nice to have a sequel like this actually before going to movie i thought that movie will go of the roofs as many sequels gone but its a far better sequel then other and to come into the movie its once again the movie has some fine cars and babes as well and it has some fine rides too but movie should have more fast suiting to the title and it even lacks in the middle of the movie and on the way coming to the story of the movie it should have been a new one but anyway the visuals are entertaining from first to last and the soundtracks are also fineSO finally every one can have nice moment to watch this movie and enjoy the movie today itself,surendranath,2009-04-10,2009
4.0,Like finishing the last mile of a race on cruise control,"In my review of The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, I elaborated on the inevitability of The Fast and the Furious's fall from the roots of its original two films. The first two films emphasized a strong sense of plausibility in its circumstances; when I say that, I mean that it resonated with its audiences in a manner that had them seeing themselves on-screen and the kind of ridiculous car tricks and stunts they attempt to pull off when they're with their buddies. The chemistry of Paul Walker and Vin Diesel was undeniable, and the charm at hand was enough to sustain an entire film. The inevitability I spoke of in my review of the third film was that this series would slowly drift away from that focus and, in turn, be more about pushing boundaries and becoming a glossier, more implausible action spectacle than keeping the kind of down-home feel of the original films.Fast & Furious, which, yes, is the fourth film, indicated by the lack of two ""the""'s in the title the franchise used up until this point, turns a fun and amiable series, thus far, into a gritty, CSI-style drama. It morphs into a primetime drama with some seriously expensive street-racing sequences that, again, somehow solve and uncover the most layered drug busts and thefts across the continental United States. The result is a film that, after probably the best opening scene of the entire series so far, slowly spirals into the drudgery of senseless mayhem and cheerless characters.Poor Paul Walker has even sacrificed all the coolness and nonchalant mannerisms from the first two films to become one of the flattest actors on screen here, lacking all emotion. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that, from my count, Walker's Brian O'Conner character gets beat up three times in this film, and at one point, takes a serious beating after a carwreck. The fifth film of this ostensibly neverending franchise should open with the maimed Walker and his comrades in the hospital struggling to swallow Vicodin with miniature plastic cups of apple juice if it even wanted to replicate anything close to realism.Walker's Brian O'Conner has been reinstated to the police force, and Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) has been relaxing in Panama City for the past few months when he gets a call from his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) that Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Dom's mechanic/girlfriend, was killed in a potentially pre-meditated car accident. Brian's investigating leads him to the name of Arturo Braga (John Ortiz), a heroin kingpin intent on smuggling copious amounts of heroin from the U.S. to Mexico. Brian and Dom, who are now rekindling old enemy territories with Brian returning to the force, must attempt to work together to avenge Letty's death, with Dom also trying to remain out of trouble and stay away from police with his fugitive status.As stated, the opening scene of Fast & Furious takes the cake for the franchise's strongest, most entertaining opening thus far, and possibly the best scene in the entire series all along, as well. The scene involves Dom, Letty, and the remainder of his crew attempting to steal fuel tankers off of a big-rig truck, which is hauling six or so. The object is Rico Santos (singer Don Omar) and Teo Lego (Teo Calderón) to maintain speed with the rig in their vehicle so that Letty can hop aboard the truck, freeze the rig's connection to another rig and smash it with a large wrench, which would allow it to properly latch on to Han's (Sung Kang) truck for safe-keeping. Trying to elaborate on the interworkings of this scene is difficult in itself, but watching this unfold is every bit an action film fan's dream, especially during the harrowing, incendiary conclusion.This scene is the indisputable highlight in a film that greatly falters because (a) it takes itself far too seriously for a film about street-racing, (b) doesn't have the actors nor the narrative weight to make this film anything other than a dime-a-dozen story of a group of guys trying to stop the Pablo Escobar of (insert drug or illegal activity here), and (c), forgoes profiling the admirable energy levels of its performers. Fast & Furious is about as much fun as getting to the final lap of a race, maintaining your speed, putting your vehicle on cruise control, and then flipping radio channels to see what you can listen to while you miss all the excitement and fun that got you there in the first place.Starring: Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, John Ortiz, Don Omar, Teo Calderón, Sang Kung, and Michelle Rodriguez. Directed by: Justin Lin.",StevePulaski,2015-12-09,2015
10.0,Ummmm,"Whoever review the ""slow and plodding"" thing, needs to be fired/shot/locked away forever, my eyes hurt from reading all the fail he wrote. I don't see anyone of the things he wrote anywhere in the movie, the story isn't hard to figure out, it's a revenge flic. The story was extremely action packed, and didn't stop for a second. If the review guy is into realistic movies with a small amount of action, I suggest he go review some documentaries, try Gran Tornio if you want a ""realistic"" movie. That review was the worst I've ever read, I don't get why he even comments on the lady halfway through the movie's nipples, I guess he was trying to make his review lengthy to make it look readable, regardless of how pathetic it was.",berter122,2009-04-10,2009
3.0,Very implausible,"This film finally brings us what we were waiting for so much, but it is much less credible than the first ones.In this film the tendency to use the conveniences to get out of the conflict begins, these conveniences end up being implausible and not very credible for the audience, although there is less than in the most recent films of the saga, but even so it does not stop being a resource cheap. The story ends up being boring since it doesn't seem like it's going anywhere or wanting to resolve a conflict, it's just chases or car races, which are even bad due to their horrible editing and mediocre special effects. They introduce new characters but there is no development of them, nor of what happened in the time that has elapsed to the already known characters.Every time the situations that the characters go through and the story to be told are less credible, even the cars go into the background to tell a boring and tedious story.",isaacochoterena,2022-01-04,2022
10.0,Wrong people wrong,"I did enjoy this movie a lot. For those people saying how bad ""Paul Walker"" was in last two movies, must of not seen ""Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift"" at all, because there was no ""Paul Walker"" or any from the original cast. So get off that drug your on and re-watch the 3rd movie again.This movie has met my expectations, and would be better if there were more street racing than tracking down a drug lord. I like testosterone movies like this. There is not too many action movies to watch anymore. I got this on DVD, and it is great. I would watch this over again, and also the first one. The second and third movies were not that good, but if you going to say something about those two movies, you better get your facts straight.",utahman1971,2009-11-07,2009
5.0,Back to the story,"Finally, eight years after The Fast and The Furious we get a direct sequel. This time, Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) must work together again to avenge the murder of Toretto's lover Letty Ortiz (Rodriguez) and apprehend drug lord Arturo Braga (John Ortiz). It's rare that a series of movies finally finds itself in the fourth installment, much less gets that many chances. But here you go - these movies really start becoming beloved right here. Sung Kang shows up as Han Lue, Dominic's right-hand man, bridging the last Japanese side of the franchise, while also introducing Gal Gadot as Gisele Yashar, a liaison for the evil Braga. Laz Alonso also shows up as Fenix Calderon, Braga's right-hand man who murders Letty and sets this whole movie's story arc in motion. This movie paved the way - pardon the road pun - for the other movies in this series. In fact, it outgrossed The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift in its first weekend. Of course, Letty wouldn't stay gone long. But we'll get to that soon enough.",BandSAboutMovies,2020-08-06,2020
10.0,one of the best action movies ever made,"This movie is one of my favorites, and starts with a heist in the middle of the mountains with dom and his family.then after the opening we discover letty is missing and brian is a cop again. So in many ways this movie takes place after the first and everybody returns and theres new people in the crew. For me the best scenes are -the audition race, in the night, filmed in locations that look real and everything seems to be happen in a real city(never feels like a movie set) -how dom here is a detective and he finds what happened to letty and why, just visiting the place -the whole third act, when dom and brian are friends again and both try to catch the bad guy in the desert.not only the movie becomes a action movie with alot of nice scenes, you see both brian and dom working togheter, and obviusly now mia is back with brian, and dom have his charger ready to race and go. The music is great, the action feels real, and the drama is really good. Also theres jokes(like when they ask brian how many cars he wants and he say he wants them all)for car fans, dom is seen back in his garage working.he build two cars in the movie. Brian build one and get one free because dom. Wish this movie have better rating, is funny to watch and never dissapoints.",Cinema2kMendoza,2022-04-04,2022
5.0,Return of the original cast,This film starts pulling together all the parts of the series that worked. The spin-offs had been somewhat successful but they lacked the core strength of Diesel and Walker being together. Walker has grown into his role over time and the improved dialogue allows for less cringe worthy exchanges. The plot is still generic and is only a slight improvement over number 2. Disappointing plot undermines what should've of a slam dunk. The revenge plot is new for the series and from this moment on the storylines grow even more insane.,nicholls905-280-546911,2020-04-24,2020
8.0,Solid Action Movie,"The subsequent films in the Fast and the Furious series always have more thrill and action than the preceding film. As is customary, the movie's opening sequence bursts onto the screen with the most action and tension. The first-scene action makes it possible for viewers to fixate on the screen the entire time. It was the best in the franchise so far, I was actually surprised with how much plot was in this movie and there seemed to be more importance focused on the story. The acting was better than any of the other 3. For any fast and the furious fans this is not a let down but another awesome film.",IPyaarCinema,2023-05-13,2023
4.0,"Fast and Furious, just not near alright enough","Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are back, and they are having to work together even though they kind of don't really like each other still. The movie basically is all about the bad guys and the good guys being Walker and Diesel where both of them have the old shared enemy thing going on and have to help each other to achieve their goal. The plot kind of plays out like a crime thriller but with lots of cars, in fact I even felt at times like the cars were not as important in this one as before, they don't talk about them as if they are humans like they have before. The reasons I think this movie is poor I will go into but first I must say if you haven't seen the one's before this then go and watch them or this will make no sense.Let's start with the actors and the star attractions to the show, Paul Walker and Vin Diesel return in the style they left us with last. The duo have a strange problem in which I felt was actually the director and writers fault, giving them lines that make them look really dumb and obvious although neither actor does that well in this. The film has a lot of poor acting throughout and though it definitely isn't really dislikeable, still just far from good enough in this already high grossing franchise. The thing is I didn't hate this movie far from it in fact it isn't actually bad, but for me it is too close to being bad for it to even break average, the whole story is pretty basic but the people behind the scenes are the one's who make it a let down.Justin Lin is the man in the directors chair and for me he is again poor, the vision he sets out is just too like I said before, obvious, and he turns some moments which could have been good into over the top action and acting. Chris Morgan writes again and the collaborating between Lin and Morgan just is not going well, the dialogue is messy and like I said the whole plot is set out in such a generic and basic way. This movie will try to draw you in with all its action and big chases and races but all of it is false things to make you excited and I refused to be won over by disappointing work behind the scenes. Now the fourth instalment is probably somewhere so far into the series around third in my rankings, just about better than Tokyo Drift but below the first two. If you're interested in the series and have maybe already really connected with certain characters then maybe you will enjoy this more than I did and although I didn't really not enjoy it, I just felt it too much of a mess to be a film I could look back on with positivity. What Justin Lin tries to create is a movie that is fast but sombre and contains a whole lot of one-liners to try and impress, some come off well but the majority do not and overall I didn't feel pleased enough by the lines.So The Fast and Furious marches on and although this does it fast and furious, they forgot to make it actually good. One weird thing I felt about this was that actors like Walker and Vin Diesel are getting better as their respective characters and for the first time in the series since the first maybe, I could feel a little connection with them if only in select points. Finally I would recommend this to of course fan's of the series but also those who like big stunts and a bit of action + fast cars too, it feels a bit like a movie that someone attached NOS too and then flung into a cinema screen full pelt.",willcundallreview,2015-09-18,2015
8.0,Something changed.... For the better,"'THE' fast and 'THE' furious was a fine movie. Very unbelievable, had a knack for being cheesy at times (mainly thanks to the acting of Vin Diesel) but it was one particular action that stood out to me. I loved the blur speed special effects and the fact that the drivers in such adrenaline pumped speed races barely had their eye on the road (more towards the hot passenger or opposing car) and also enjoyed the lack of boredom that the genre of action constantly dominated. All in all, an all time great.Now for Fast and Furious. After a long stretch of constantly average episodes such as 2fast 2furious and Tokyo Drift, the makers managed to redeem themselves. They brought back the action of the first movie that we came to adore but on top of that, they managed to do what Batman Begins did for the other Batmans. They added a factor of realism which I personally had never seen before. Sure, the action from the get go was, fact beyond reasonable doubt, staring us in the face, but there was a certain drama that I had never noticed in any other Fast and Furious. Vin Diesel's rough, tough character was slightly cracked into something deeper. Paul Walker also, acted slightly above solidly and who could discount the females in a movie like this!I'll let you viewers be the judge. I reckon you gotta really appreciate the Fast and The Furious (the first 1) to completely enjoy a flick like this one. Adding the drama quality to the bar chart of predominant action/thriller, you have to hand it to the makers and applaud them for adding more of a deepness than any other Fast and Furious. I think after seeing and enjoying Batman Begins, It's what we're looking for nowadays.Overall score, A very strong:8/10",stee_nolan,2009-05-06,2009
4.0,Fast and Furious,"Isn't Han dead? oh no wait this is a sequel to the first film that doesn't ignore the second and third film but just takes place before them. So this is when Han was running with Toretto before he leaves for Japan...aaaah right. It feels pretty desperate for them to go way back and make a sequel to the first film after time has moved on with the second and third films. Did we really need to know what happened right after the first film? did we really need to see Han with Toretto? couldn't they just move ahead with a fourth that takes places after two and three? The whole structure of the franchise just seems so convoluted now. So Walker is now an agent in a suit for the FBI, so he looks even more like Keanu Reeves in 'Point Break', really helping his impression ten fold...totally bra! Toretto's girlfriend has been killed by a drug dealers henchman, the same drug dealer O'Conner is after, so both end up going after the same cartel. At the same time Toretto is still on the most wanted list which is still causing O'Conner morality issues, anyway to hell with all that! cue the pointless street racing! This film really does feel completely and utterly generic in every way. The plot just seems so pointless and uninspired, Letty is killed for pretty much unknown reasons (we don't find out why for ages), but I assume its mainly because Rodriguez wanted out of the franchise. From that point on its just watching Vin Diesel swagger from one set piece to another beating guys up or generally running away from the law. I mean really, the main bad guy drug kingpin organises a street race through downtown LA just to recruit a driver for his drug smuggling operation. The whole sequence is so pathetic, all the drivers line up like they were top guns of the chav world...bling city, one guy is black, one guy is white, one guy is Latino etc...PC much? Its not even a sensible race, more like a destruction derby and completely unrealistic. I realise this is not a serious action film but come on, lets at least make the racing sensible, it is the films main selling point. Oh...A hyper modded Skyline struggling to beat an US brick (American Muscle), really? I don't think so, import will always win. That Skyline should have been pushing 1000BHP, should have been if properly modded. The tanker hijack sequence at the start of the film is just as dumb as the exact same sequence in the first film. Once again I gotta ask...why not just stop the tanker, take the driver out at gun point and then calmly take the fuel?? surely that's easier? Oh no wait the director wants to have an exciting chase sequence with lots of fast cars and a big explosion at the end, oooooh gotcha. Then there is the quite plainly idiotic chase sequences through these underground tunnels across the US border into Mexico. I can't even begin to express how stupid this whole concept is let alone how awful it looks with terrible CGI. For starters who built these tunnels? how? when? how did the US border patrols not notice this massive undertaking??! How the hell does anyone know exactly where the entrance is to these tunnels when they are disguised as a rock face and you're travelling towards them at about 200+ MPH! The sequences within the tunnels are just dreadful, it looks like a video game. As the actors sit in the mock cars you can laugh at the hideous CGI rock formations whizzing past in the windows/rear windscreen. Again I know this isn't a serious flick but come on...this takes the p*ss. And we are to believe they are all zooming down these narrow badly lit mine shafts in super imports and US muscle cars at well over 150MPH?! Really? What I love about this franchise/film is the fact Toretto always seems to have a modded muscle car. Doesn't matter where he is or what's happened, he turns up with a newly charged up car...always American muscle. I wish it was this easy in reality. Even at the very end, O'Conner and what's left of Toretto's crew pop up to bust him out...all driving more expensive heavily modded cars! Where do they get them from?? how many Dodge Chargers have they gone through now? how many do they own? do they clone them?? Do any of these guys have insurance? wait silly question. This film did well simply because the original cast came back, but I can't for the life of me understand how that helps. Yes I like Vin Diesel but the rest are terrible, the plot is formulaic and dull, the film is choppy and they have started to slide towards the action genre meaning actual street racing is out. But even the racing sequences are poor here, just ridiculous and show more resemblance to James Bond. Not to be taken seriously of course but this film has lost its originality and simply become a common action mess.",phubbs,2014-11-22,2014
9.0,Greatest Fast & Furious till now.,"Action-packed with nice cars, sexy girls and an amazing soundtrack, there's nothing you could ask more for in a film.Vin Diesel's character was great in this film, I was glad that they got rid of the guy who looks like a rapist in the past films. The story is nothing special but its great, when I came into the cinema I expected this movie to be like Transformers, dull, loud and filled with non-sense action but I was surprised to see that they managed to balance the amount of action and acting.People expect that they're whole life will be changed when they go into a theater and watch a flick for a 100 minutes, if your one of those people then you will not like this film, if your one of those sane people who like an entertaining film then you'll love this one.Remember to get some popcorn on this one!",thethelementofdoom,2009-04-13,2009
3.0,Fast & Furious Review,"Fast & Furious(2009) Starring: Vin Disel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, John Ortiez, Laz Alonso, Gal Gadot, Jack Conley, Shea Whigham, Liz lapria, Sung Kang, Don Omar, Brandon T. Jackson, and Mousa Kraish Directed By: Justin Lin Review New Model. Original Parts. These movies may be fast but they need to catch up and that's exactly what they started doing with this one. Not to mention it has a perfect title Fast & Furious, this should have been the third film to be released instead of Tokyo Drift. Tokyo Drift was just utterly terrible. When a crime brings them back to L.A., fugitive ex-con Dom Toretto reignites his feud with agent Brian O'Conner. But as they are forced to confront a shared enemy, Dom and Brian must give in to an uncertain new trust if they hope to outmaneuver him. And the two men will find the best way to get revenge: push the limits of what's possible behind the wheel. The opening sequence of the film was amazing it was like a heist where they were getting on a cargo to steal some( well to be honest I don't what they were trying to get) but right when they complete that mission soon someone dies and that causes a great dispute for Don Tretto. The performances from the cast like Vin Disel, he isn't great but he isn't bad he's just good. Michelle Rodriguez is the weakest of the cast and was barely in the movie so I guess that was good and Paul Walker was good. But everyone else was terrible. The direction from Justin Lin was better this time around I felt like with Tokyo Drift he was more up for shining flashy cars at you in bad ass racing. Fast & Furious is a step up in the series it's got some good acting, great action sequences but falls short with some bad acting and an uninteresting plot that falls flat. Fast & Furious gets a two and a half out of five.",Spideyfan-963-246215,2016-09-09,2016
8.0,Fitting For the Franchise,"The only spoiler here is the underwhelming comments of movie critics. My spouse and I saw the other three installments, and although we were not a big fan of the first one (we liked 2 best), the pro and antagonists hit the mark. We have the same two back again and although the plot may be thin it's there, it's simple and it works (not to spoil for those who haven't seen the movie). Additionally, the action sequences and special effects are riveting at times. My business partners son is a computer geek, and he prides himself on his knowledge of good special effects, and he thought that while another current release action adventure movie with superheroes had terrible special effects, this film captured his attention as well. Again, I liked two and three better, and my spouse thought this installment was the second best behind 2 Fast, 2 Furious. Good looking cars, people, special effects and the music fits the feast. In fact, I couldn't get my spouse out of her seat while the credits were rolling. (She told me it was because she thought something may come up in the credits, a device similar to some recent movies, but I know she just liked the music!) Give us fans a high five as an encore, maybe ... ‘way too fast for the furious.’ (Please bring back Vin, Paul and Jordana)",obrofta,2009-04-13,2009
5.0,Disjointed,"Despite this film being the first time Dom and Bryan reunite since the first film, this film leaves a lot to be desired. Letti's death is emotional and enough motivation to drive Dom and the film. But I felt it could have had more of a plot or additional storylines to make more interesting. Also Dom, despite being a stoic character, does not show the audience he's that affected. We don't see enough emotion and intensity that supposedly exists. The action scenes are also a bit of a let down and insults the viewers intelligence. We see some unrealistic action scenes and a lot of plot armour that shields the main characters and villains. Overall the film felt disjointed and it abruptly transitioned from one scene to another and a lot plot points could have been explained better, the viewer had to quickly piece these together to assume what was going on. A weak entry in the franchise.",Kingslaay,2023-06-01,2023
10.0,Very great movie for CAR LOVERS,"One of the perfect action movies. I don't know why exactly people watch a movie with serious thoughts. There are things which the viewer should take lightly and just enjoy and have fun. Fast and Furious series has been a great treat for all car lovers and this one is the best of them all when it comes to races, excellent driving action and motor stunts. There are quite a few blatant errors agreed; like the one where Vin Diesel finds a criminal evidence of FBI (Letty's mobile phone) in a junkyard of Brian 0'Connor. But, some movies are just made for the fun of it and you just have to shut yourself blind for such mistakes in the plot (if there was anything like plot/story!) The greatest plus point is the races! They are really good. The tunnel fight towards the climax is definitely one of the best action scenes this summer. The race in the city is the best shot auto stunt I've ever seen. All in all, this is a great movie just for the fun of it. Please don't see this movie expecting great plot, excellent acting and trying sentiments. Just go to the cinema hall with an empty mind, enjoy the special effects and have fun.",bprashanth-gi,2009-04-14,2009
4.0,"Fast & Furious attempts to reboot a dying franchise, but there is limited fuel to reignite the series.","Fast & Furious 4. Fast & Fourious. 2 Fast 2 4ious: Tokyo Drift. What a way to reboot a franchise, by literally removing the definite article from its title. Someone give that person a medal because sweet lord it didn't work. Dom joins forces with Brian to bring down a drug cartel in Mexico who happened to have been involved with Letty's death. Wait was that a spoiler? No, it's in the trailer, synopsis and every other critic review, plus everyone has essentially tackled this eternal soap opera by now. After the ""masterpiece"" that was 'Tokyo Drift', director Justin Lin takes back the series by ensuring Dom and his crew return for some high octane action. Yes? No. Granted, the car chases were well filmed and are always exhilarating to witness but I expected nothing less. It's the franchise's trademark. Whether it be street racing through night time Los Angeles or rampaging through urban Mexico, always thrilling when it's also accompanied by pounding techno beats. It gets my blood flowing. Unfortunately though, that's all this chapter has going for it. These returning characters are portrayed with such monotony and dullness that actually I didn't care for any of them. Diesel can grumble all he wants in a bid to enhance the physicality of Dom, yet he is a boring protagonist. Brian acts as his lap dog and, again, is boring. The antagonist was generic, same can be said about the plot which was ever so reminiscent to 'Point Break'. The acting was functional although Brewster, bless her for having her name on the front cover, was useless at conveying any emotion. The extent of her emotive acting is a smile at the end. Nice! The atrocious visual effects detracted from many of the action scenes, particularly the Mexican border tunnel chase. It resembled something you would find in a PlayStation game, y'know those polygonal cutscenes. It's neither fast or furious, it's just really really dull. Fortunately the franchise picks up substantially in future sequels!",TheMovieDiorama,2018-05-29,2018
9.0,Fast and Furious,"Hi all: Fast and Furious was very well written, it had great acting and stunts, and just very well done as a whole. It places itself as the third movie in the story and moves Tokyo Drift to the fourth movie in the story. If you remember the last of Tokyo Drift, and what was said - you'll understand.The only thing I found wrong with the movie was one big blooper at the very end of the show - when you watch Fast and Furious, you'll clearly see what I mean.This movie offers a lot of America muscle with import, and I wouldn't be surprised if a video game comes out. Vin is back 100%, just as you remember him from the beginning of his career. Like in the other shows, many beautiful cars get destroyed.",thanna-1,2009-04-07,2009

10.0,The movie is better than previous installments,"Fast & Furious 4 is a thrilling ride that takes us back to the roots of the franchise, showcasing the raw power of family and loyalty.The film explodes with high-octane action, featuring incredible car chases and daring stunts that will leave you breathless.The chemistry between Vin Diesel and Paul Walker is undeniable, reminding us why they are the heart and soul of the franchise.The film expertly blends action and emotion, creating a deeply engaging and satisfying experience.The return of Letty is a highlight of the film, adding a layer of intensity and emotional depth to the story.The film's setting in the Dominican Republic adds a vibrant and exotic backdrop to the action.The car chases are expertly crafted, showcasing the beauty and power of classic muscle cars.The film's soundtrack is a perfect blend of hard-hitting hip-hop and classic rock anthems, adding to the film's energy.Fast & Furious 4 is a reminder that family is everything, even when it's a family of criminals.This film is a must-see for any fan of high-octane action and heart-pounding thrills.",botch-30879,2024-10-24,2024
3.0,"They've got fast cars, let's get tickets out of here.","The fourth installment of the franchise gets Vin Diesel, Scott Walker, Michelle Rodriguez (for ten minutes) and Jordana Brewster together and aims to satisfy the slowly fading fans' tastes - disappointingly, it's probably the worst volume yet. First of all, it's not fast - at all, the car chases are confusing, badly shot, few and worst of all, all too animated with CGI, and the plot moves nothing like those supposed cars. Second, it's not furious, Vin Diesel thinks he is, occasionally, but only when he bothers, and the rest looks stupidly blunt and careless. Where's the fierce, fire and flame? Not to be seen miles away. I had to spool through that terrible climax where the plot has taken us up to switching points of cars chasing each other either in the dead desert, or in a dark, tight tunnel - both without any sense of speed. Quite terrible as we find a popped hood empty.",EijnarAmadeus,2011-02-13,2011
8.0,What sequel?,"First of all, this film did two things right: it brought back the original cast and it completely ignored that there ever was a sequel. This has everything I liked about the original, great action, great heart and it was wonderful to have Vin Diesel back in the driver's seat. The logic of the plot was a little fuzzy but overall, I really enjoyed it. I return my rating of the franchise to an 8 (great) out of 10. {Action Drama}",nancyldraper,2021-07-10,2021
4.0,Runs out of gas,"I saw Fast Five and Fast & Furious 6 before the earlier instalments, and the earlier instalments of this high octane franchise are noticeably weaker. This one sees the return of a stubbornly blank Vin Diesel, who is trying to find the one responsible for the death of his girlfriend. Paul Walker is now an agent again, and the two work together to try and stop a drug trafficker. As I love action films, this was moderately enjoyable for me but Fast & Furious is undeniably the worst of the films that I've seen. The film opens up with an entertaining heist sequence which works despite an overabundance of lame CGI, before deteriorating into an overly serious turbo fuelled drive through as many action clichés as possible. It's a well made movie, and the introduction of a murder mystery is interesting, but when it's Vin Diesel who barely changes his expression throughout and who really cannot do anything other than be tough, it just doesn't work. The film fails to reconcile a more serious plot with its cheesy action movie origins.The action is enjoyable, but there's plenty of downtime which just becomes dull. The emphasis on car culture and racing is very tedious and there's not enough proper action. Fans of the franchise and action lovers (like me) will be entertained, but casual audiences will just not have as much fun. When it comes to female characters, occasionally the film makes you think of Michael Bay, while during a race sequence the endangering of numerous innocent bystanders is pretty awkward. The acting is barely passable. Vin Diesel is just too one note to be interesting. Paul Walker is a little better. It has a good finale, but throughout there's just not enough fun. With Justin Lin behind the camera, it's well directed although the camera gets a bit shaky at times. A watchable film overall. I can't give it a higher rating because it just isn't very good, but it nobly tries to go in a slightly different direction and offers some decent action, although one rather good action scene was spoilt by the trailer.4/10",Rickting,2015-03-15,2015
8.0,9/10,Fast & Furious 2009 Is still my fav fast furious what I have seen I like there is a story in this movie that is what makes me like it and Brian as an FBI is different The very beginning of this movie is great we have the group trying to get some gas tanks which kinda failed than Toretto leaves Letty so than Toretto is called saying Letty was murdered Mia and Toretto go to the location where it happened Toretto trying to figure out what happened So than Toretto is trying to figure out what happened while Brian is trying to figure out with the drug dealer Campos is doing and trying to find him they do race against each other in this movie which was funny because Toretto Cheated which was great so Brian got mad they do team in this movie when they have to work together to take down the dealer and Letty's Killer also the ending to this movie is great also I have not seen fast five When I do I bet that movie is going to be my fav so yeah Fast & furious 2009 is a good reboot to the franchise So I am give Fast & Furious 2009 an A-,projectsgamer,2021-03-18,2021
8.0,Most believable move of the series.,I have watched all the F & F movies. Most of them have high octane chases. But it stopped making sense after the F & F 6 movie. Addition of Rock was not very helpful in the story line. May be they should have kept it close to the racing part. The best movie based on racing I believe is Ford vs Ferrari. The detail and story and the need for racing in the first place all made sense. And I believe the F & F 4 was close to it. The need to pass the mountains with time limit made sense and having the best racers was justified for the task.,swapneelshinde,2023-01-28,2023
3.0,By far the worst of the franchise: Just Awful; Wouldn't Recommend,"Directed by Justin LinStarring Paul Walker, Vin Disel and John Ortiz​ Plot Overview: When a crime brings them back to the mean streets of Los Angeles, fugitive ex-convict Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) reignite their high-octane feud. However, when a common enemy rears his head, Dom and Brian must learn how to work together and trust one another in order to defeat him.If you still enjoy this franchise, and truly care about these character: don't watch this movie. It is by far the worst film in the franchise and contains so little enjoyment and substance that I honestly think it's unbelievably lucky that 'Fast Five' was made. I honestly can't stand this film. None of the actors are good, some are remotely passable but that is still being very generous. The 'action' and 'set pieces' are so awful that I honestly believe the Drift Race in 'Tokyo Drift' was more exciting that this. It's one of the most boring, dullest movies I've seen in a long time and contains no genuine enjoyment to warrant a recommendation. If you need any more reasons to avoid this atrocity, then I will go more in depth.Saying Vin Disel is a 'bad actor' was pretty generous for this movie. You could tell me he's a robot and I would completely believe you because he's one of the most dull, bland, barren, boring, emotionless, robotic actors that still work today. He can't emit any emotions other than HAPPY, ANGRY and MUMBLE-y. It amazes me he still gets work because I don't see what the appeal of him as an actor. Paul Walker was, to be fair, passable as Brian O'Connor but even then he was extremely basic and didn't do much to impress. John Ortiz was very weak as the Brauga. The villain in the movie was also incredibly weak.There is no real story that runs through this movie and any glimmer of hope that one might exist is locked in Torreto's car and put in front a train. The ending was pretty cool and looked very neat.Technically, this movie is immensely flawed. The cinematography was absolutely dreadful and the lighting was genuinely depressing. The editing was awful and it's some of the worst cinematography I've seen in a pretty long time. The effects were pretty nice but they weren't exactly a primary focus and didn't affect the quality of the movie.The main thing this movie needed to do was provide really good and enjoyable action/set pieces. This movie completely failed to do that. As stated before, I would rather watch Lucas Black face of against the 'Drift King' and would rather watch Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson drive out of a garage with 10,000 cars again than sit through the truly, truly awful action sequences in this movie.This movie tried to replace the 'fun moments' with 'dramatic moments' which I would normally be fine with but it was done so incredibly poorly. It wasn't needed for this type of film and just felt so forced and tacked on.In conclusion, there is a reason people don't refer to this movie when talking about the 'Fast and Furious' franchise. I can't say anyone should watch this movie because it just isn't worth the watch.3/10Wouldn't Recommend",EthanBJones_03,2017-05-14,2017
8.0,Very happy they brought back the originals,"We loved the Fast and the Furious franchise for three cars, hot girls, and the duo of Paul Walker and Vin Diesel. I was so happy that they brought back another Fast and the Furious movie with the original characters because the Tokyo Drift film prior to this couldn't have been more irrelevant to the franchise. The movie starts off by starting the film with what the series is best known for, hot cars and Vin Diesel stunt-driving in a hot car along with Michelle Rodriguez who I have always loved. The adrenaline rush you get just from the opening scene makes you smile ans say YES the Fast and the Furious is back. After the fuel truck is done flipping and exploding, a second scene takes place of a detective tracking down a vigilante on a wild foot chase. You know who this is, Brian O'Conner. Just from the first two scenes of exploding fuel trucks and a guy driving another guy through a two story window leaves you saying wow, well it did for me anyway. After all the action has cleared, the main story of the film starts to take place in which Dom leaves to escape from getting caught by the cops once again. Months after his departure, he gets a phone call from his sister Mia saying Letty was murdered. Now the emotional tone of the film sets when one of the loving characters from the franchise is gone. The entire film focuses on Dom getting revenge against the gang that murdered Letty as does it also focus on Paul Walker's character tracking down the same group of people. Fast and the Furious 4, if thats what you wanna call it, sticks to what it was known for and thats what fans of the movie want to see. There are great heart pumping scenes of fast car chases that never lets up. The ending with Dom going to jail, and then having Brian and Mia trying to get him out couldn't have been a more perfect ending. For those who are wanting what they gave you in the first Fast and the Furious movie, this one is just that.",ennieday09,2009-10-08,2009
9.0,THE original,"The order of the Fast and Furious movies is a bit confusing ,but I guess the idea is to have retrospect.This is the most original FnF movie you can watch. There's your all time scene of Vin Diesel stealing a gasoline truck and having an incredible cascade just in the first 10 minutes of the movie.I'm so sorry to myself that I never had the opportunity to see this on big screen.The plot:
10/10 as every Fast and Furious movie the plot is always different ,but with one common target. To get yourself out of some type of pit and becoming the so called ""champion""The acting:
We have Vin Diesel , Paul Walker and Sung Kang , there's no way not to enjoy it.",hereuser,2023-07-28,2023
8.0,A Straight-Up Thrill Ride!!,"I didn't know what to expect from the fourth installment of the ‘Fast and Furious’ series. I went in the theatre thinking ‘Okay, this is a sequel, and sequels rarely measure up to your expectations. Is this just movie producers trying profit from the franchise?’ I went in with doubts, but I came out with the certainty that director Justin Lin wasn't merely trying to make money off this successful franchise, like many others attempt to do with popular, money-makers like this one. This is an action-packed movie with decent writing that will keep your eyes glued to the screen!! Also, as anyone thats even slightly familiar with the series would expect, the cars in this movie are top-notch, and modified to perfection. This film does not have as many foreign cars in it as the previous films (a friend of mine suspects that was strategically done to boast interest in American cars), but classic American muscle cars such as the '72 Ford Gran Torino, a '70 Chevy Chevelle SS, and...well, I'll just let you see the movie to find out for yourself.",j_jefferson55,2009-04-17,2009

8.0,Keeps getting better and better,"The saga continues to improve with the return of the original cast and Justin Lin who is directing his second film in the series after 'Tokyo Drift'. The screen story is also more developed by abandoning the puerile tone of the beginnings in favor of a more mature story, which is developed into a classical action film, solidly acted by Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, John Ortiz, Laz Alonso and Gal Gadot in her acting debut. The franchise has therefore moved up a gear and is heading towards promising new adventures as long as they present such a level of quality.",OMTR,2023-05-12,2023

8.0,A complete reboot of the franchise,"How do I sum up Fast and Furious. Well before I go any further let me just say that it was everything I expected and more. This movie was a reboot for the franchise, just as much as Batman Begins was for batman, Casino Royal was for Bond, The Incredible HULK was for the hulk series etc. It features a lot more of a dramatic storyline then the other movies and isn't just a complete popcorn flick displaying a lot of emotion and relasionships between the characters. The movie almost seems to play out now as more of a crime drama then a racing movie, but also features a lot of the racing high paced action we know and love.Well on with the characters/story for the movie. This movie features a returning cast from the past The Fast and the Furious movies. We have Vin Deisel back as Dom, Paul Walker back as Brian, Michell Rodriguez as Letty, Jordan Brewster as Mia, and other characters that return in the form of camio appearances(just to let you know, no Tyrese or Lucas Black). I thought all of the characters did a really good job, and their relasionships and emotions were explored a lot more. So the acting is a big upgrade from the past movies, but don't be stupid enough to compare it to Oscar winning performances or expect them to be at that level. The characters do their jobs and are all very likable.Now with the story, basically without many spoilers, the gang is brought together by the murder of a mutual friend. So Brian and Dom work together to find the killer, and to bring down a huge criminal organization. At the same time Brian struggles with his loyalties to his job and to his friends who are on completely different sides of the law, and is forced to make a choice on whether hes a ""good guy playing a bad guy or a bad guy playing a good guy"" (as Mia puts it). So ya its straight forword but a solid plot that really sets up the whole movie, and is not just a completely brainless popcorn flick.All in all Fast and Furious was a very worthwhile movie. In terms of where it stands in the franchise it greatly supasses 2f2f and Tokeyo Drift, and even manages to be as good as or better then the first one in some aspects. If I had to choose Id say the first was better, but this one definitely stands up and is a worthwhile addition to the series. Anyways I give Fast and Furious an 8/10 and totally recommend seeing it in theaters, as it is totally worth $10, and you will only get one chance to see all the action on the big screen where it is at its best.",merce_hoola,2009-04-03,2009
9.0,Absolutely Great!!!,"I loved this film, although I think just a bit more driving should have been in there, most the driving was in the tunnels and the race at the start. But it was still a great film! I thought that it was really sad how Letty was killed in the beginning as the rest of the movie did not feel right without her! I am hoping for another Fast & Furious film as if you think about it, in Tokyo Drift, at the end as we all know Dom shows up, and as I have heard at the end of this one, when Brian, Mia and the other 2 show up, that's how he ends up in Tokyo! So I am hoping that they will give us a great big finally, out on the other side of the world! Something big and one that has everything in it! Great cars, people, drama, excitement, action..... EVERYTHING!!! But all in all I thought that this film was great! I am a huge Fast & Furious fan (not to a scary extent) and also love my cars, and this film just ticks all the boxes for me! :) xox",lodonnell1,2009-05-07,2009
10.0,a total trip,"I have seen all the previous movies, and I absolutely loved the first movie. I admit it, I really wanted to be able to drive like that. I watched the two sequels, only too fast too furious stuck out due to the good music. Tokyo drift just didn't cut it, it wasn't ""fast and furious"" by any standard. it was nice to see that most of the original cast was back, they seemed to be right back in the roles that i had come to love in the original! my roommate and i went to the theater with very anxiously, even though we had both seen the trailers. the opening bit was AMAZING!!! i was literally sitting on the edge of my seat. both my roommate and I were so wrapped up in the movie we were dancing to the beats while still sitting! despite our apprehensions going into the movie we walked out with our minds blown! it was that good. the cars, the men, the driving, the little bit of romance and the awesome ramming scene.if you ever were looking for a good time, even if only for 2 hours, this is your ticket. great movie, go see it!! 10 out of 10!!",beccakwalsh13,2009-04-08,2009

9.0,"Again, again...here again","Everybody knows the story and the ratings of the Furious movies. Since the first one, something gone wrong and all the actors and all the movies made a wrong turn. The second part was good and the third OK, but the changes made it worse than the others. And now, here are they again. The original cast is back, and the 4th movie works. I think the most reason is Vin Diesel, who made this franchise famous. His character, Dom is the essence in the Furious films. Paul Walker of course is still good in his role, and the girls too.The story is OK, nothing special, but enough. Runtime is 107 minutes, that is a special happiness for me. I hate short movies! Here, everybody has enough time to feel the mood. The car scenes are cool, and there is a lot of good known action, where Mr. Diesel shows us how to do... Fine! The rating is OK, this movie is a big thumb up!!!",cibyll-1,2009-04-14,2009
8.0,A Fitting End to the 2000s Fast and Furious Era,"Fast & Furious (2009), the fourth installment of the popular franchise, serves as a thrilling last hurrah for the 2000s era while paving the way for what the series has become in the 2010s and beyond (still debating whether this is a good thing or bad thing). The film brings back fan-favorite characters Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster), and Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) after their absence in the third movie, Tokyo Drift.The plot revolving around Letty's (Michelle Rodriguez) ""death"" and the rekindling of Brian's romantic relationship with Mia is an intriguing premise that keeps the audience engaged. Additionally, the film explores the complex relationship between Brian and Dom, which adds depth to the story. The introduction of Giselle (Gal Gadot) as a new character also proves to be a welcome addition to the series.One aspect of the film that left me slightly confused was Mia's anger towards Brian for tearing her family apart. Given her lack of contact with him since 2001, it seemed unfair for her to place the blame solely on him. However, this minor issue does not detract significantly from the overall enjoyment of the movie.The film balances the grounded storyline with the inclusion of the FBI and high-profile organizations and agencies. The action sequences and stunts, a staple of the franchise, are well-executed and contribute to the adrenaline-pumping experience.In conclusion, while Fast & Furious (2009) may not be one of my personal favorite in the franchise, it is still a highly entertaining and solid addition to the series. It serves as an excellent end to the 2000s era of the Fast and Furious saga and sets the stage for the more over-the-top and action-packed sequels to come.",douglasc11,2025-01-05,2025
10.0,Fast and furious awesome franchise,"Fast & Furious (2009) is an awesome Action packed sequel, where The Fast and the Furious (2001) stopped. This is the real sequel to The Fast and The Furious. I love that Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster reprise their roles back to the roots the way they were. This is my fourth favorite best film in the series, this film Is a seat to the edge from the beginning till the end. This movie kept me thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. Sure it's a little far fetched, but who cares? It's a movie, and definitely not as bad as some people are saying. Besides, the point of watching a movie is to escape reality so I don't understand why people complain when movies are not realistic. Provided a cinematic equivalent of NOS to the franchise with a tone shift that helped make it one of the most popular and profitable action series in the last decade. Excellent flick. Much better than the middle two. Just forget those movies happened. This was good balls to the walls action with much better actors with the original 4 back together. Bad idea making 2 and 3 :) Vin Diesel and Paul Walker re team with Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster for the ultimate chapter of the franchise built on speed! When fugitive Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) returns to Los Angeles to avenge a loved one's death, it reignites his feud with agent Brian O'Conner (Walker). But, as they race through crowded city streets and across international lines, they must test their loyalties by joining together to bring down a shared enemy. From big rig heists to precision tunnel crawls, Fast & Furious takes you back into the high-octane world, which lives for speed, drives for the rush and breaks all the rules! ‘Maybe you're the bad guy pretending to be the good guy.’ This film is more about stopping a notorious drug lord Arturo Braga and avenging the murder of Letty (Michelle Rodriguez). This film is set back in Los Angles when everything started, after 5.years of leaving the city of Angeles for Dominican Republic after Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew become a Wanted Fugitives. Letty was murdered when she was mixed up in a drug racers mule cartel. She knew the people who hired her, will double crossed her, while trying to escape the flying bullets she was killed by a drug lord's henchman. That weary angrier Dom (Vin Diesel) brings him back to Los Angeles, to avenge his loved one's death and tracking down Drug Lord Braga and killing him. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), is now an FBI agent, and he is assigned to track down a notorious drug lord named Arturo Braga. Both men faces each other in a final showdown. Braga is looking for a fast drivers that are driving and smuggling trough desert New Mexico drugs. Brian goes again undercover only to find out that he and Dom (Vin Diesel) are been double crossed and set up on the same way that was Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) was. This film is filled with full action, fast cars, full of stunts and beautiful women. Gal Gadot is tremendous as Gisele Harabo it was her first role in this film and she was awesome, she acted the character terrific. Paul walker was the best in this film, finally, finally they did something with the character, he become an FBI Agent which I love that with the character In this movie. I love that Dom (Vin Diesel) at the end of the film didn't run, he surrender and I love how Brian ( Paul Walker) was testifying for him in the court. Seriously this film Kicks ass, although I prefer Fast Five over this Action Flick, but that doesn't mean this film did not do the job right, it did! And this film is highly underrated and criticized by critics. Also Han (Sung Kang) has a small scene in the beginning of this film, that was before they killed the beloved character in The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006).",ka-09820,2023-06-04,2023
9.0,Invigorating,"I'm gonna give this a nine.....why ??....because it was invigorating. I am gonna admit there was some cliché and boring parts, but(IMHO)the movie had enough scenes and action sequences to redeem itself from these mishaps .... Vin Diesel was damn good as a revengeful, bitter but witty son of a bitch. He (his character) brought a sort of passion to this film namely because of Letty's death...i must say he made me laugh a few times. Paul Walker ?? well, what can i say.. he was O.K. could have been better but still good enough..... There were some action that made one say ‘Holy Sh%t !!!’...some of the action was kick@ss...>>> The tunnels scenes was awesome The Ending ???....The Ending (which was sorta expected) was absolutely kickass (it made me smile). It makes one wonder if there will be a part 5....I see potential for an ongoing franchise movie",scorpius1486,2009-04-11,2009

8.0,really good!,i have seen the other fast and the furious movies and they were good. this one i liked a lot because it showed more of a storyline. i finally understood the end of fast and the furious one. this one showed more action. vin diesel and paul walker should get an award for this film. it was really cool. when vin diesel crashed into the other guy from tropic thunder i laughed. i also thought that the ending of the movie was really good. the way that the beginning of the movie was the end but with different characters. after seeing it i couldn't wait for part five. it made me wonder what happened after the gang broke him out of the bus. i hope when it comes on DVD it has deleted scenes or an alternate ending so that i can see the real way it happened or a different way that it could happen.,jaystreet12,2009-05-14,2009
8.0,As good as the first,"This is not the best movie ever made, but it definitely surpasses the second and third films in the series. It doesn't have as much action as far as racing as far as the first film goes but I believe they balanced the amount of action very well.The storyline wasn't the best, but it kept me entertained through most of the movie. The appearance of Han is minimal but they do tie in this movie to ""Tokyo Drift."" I can guarantee that if you liked the first one, you will like this one as they are similar in the type of plot, just different stories.I will definitely add this to my list of DVD's to get.",kemallory340,2009-04-15,2009
9.0,This movie was great,"I really liked the new 'Fast and Furious movie.' I thought it was a lot better than the others. The actors did a terrific job, and each character in my opinion fit their roll perfectly. I loved how much action was in this movie and how intense it was; I didn't get bored once while watching this movie because there is so much action, romance, bravery, and regrets. My favorite action part of this movie has to be towards the beginning when the truck accidentally sets on fire and is rolling very quickly toward them; they wait for just the right second to quickly drive under it. I did like the part at the end where it shows Dom (Vin Diesel) on the prison bus going to face 25 years in prison, and his sister and his friends drive up past the bus. I can't wait to see the next one to see what their plan is and how they are going to get him off the bus so he doesn't end up in prison. One part that really made me sad is when Dom's girlfriend got murdered by his rival but I really liked in the end when Dom struck back and killed him and his friend who were both more of the bad guys. Overall I believe this movie – The characters, setting, and all of the action- was spectacular. I was very surprised that l liked this movie this much after seeing the others. If you like action movies then I strongly recommend watching this movie.",karalovesscience,2009-04-22,2009
9.0,Awesome Movie,"I like all the parts of fast and furious. The first three parts were awesome. But i can't say that the fast and furious 2009 is very good because there were just races had happened in the movie and the the whole story was not good as i was thinking it would be. No matter what, it's safe to say that this entirely acceptable retooling of the franchise makes for a satisfying experience for those who enjoy four-wheeled chases, hot bodies, hot cars, and a tall dose of tough-guy machismo. I can see why Fast and Furious might be a smash as audiences look for escape from a broken economy. All those wheelies and power slides are designed to obliterate thought, not provoke it. Talk about a movie for its time.Now i am waiting for Terminator Salvation and hope it will rock. www.Start-an-Internet-business.net",monica47000,2009-05-19,2009
8.0,The best Fast and Furious film so far,"I remember last time I reviewed Fast and Furious 7, I mentioned that how I ended up watching this franchise. After I watched film 1-7 , I was clearly thinking that this film is not only the best film in the franchise, but it is also one of my most favourite film in recent years. The story: The story is like traditional buddy cop formula. It involves Dominic, who recently find out Letty has been killed in a car crash, investigating who is the culprit behind the incident. On the way, he meet back Brian, who is finding a drug lord, and let both of them in a street race. Dominic and Brian, which are still having issues for each other, meet Fenix, and Dominic find out that he is the one who killed Letty. He team up with Brian to hunt down Fenix, but the plan fails first time. They then get help and get Braga back to border, and kill Fenix on the way. Dominic do not escape and get sentenced while Brian decide to stay back with him. The storyline is pretty basic, but it is really entertaining and unique in a spy film. The relations between each elements is fluent and cohesive as well. From how Dominic and Brian reunite, to how street race affect the plan, and how Letty is related to Brian. The street race and dramatic scenes are really a standard yet unique storyline in films belong to same genre. I felt focused and enjoyed during the whole movie, which is why this movie has one of the best stories in the franchise as a whole. The visuals: The scene are very fluent and clearly, which is on par with industrial standards. What really stand out is that the flashbacks are really transparent with the present situation, and the explosions are one of the better ones in the films I watched. The car chase scenes are really convincing and motived, and I liked the overall dark photography, which the cars and actions are still clear while at the dark, and reflecting on how Dominic feel at that moment. Overall, those visuals are average but some unique moments from the view of director Justin Lin and convincing explosions really bring the whole movie become more colourful to look at. The characters: The characters in this film really stand out from the whole franchises. I really liked the chemistry between Dominic and Brian, and felt like both of them are the main characters. Dominic is interesting in this film. He uses his mean and revengeful personality to help defeat Fenix, and is less annoying than the further installments when he would form a group called ‘family’. Brian is dynamic and serious in this film, which helped enhancing the chemistry between him and Dominic and justified how they end up caring each other, while also brought his charisma back in the film. Fenix and Braga is a threat enough to bring both of the men in trouble and making Brian looked vulnerable, which is a good sign for a franchise increasingly solidify each main characters. Mia and Gisele also helped the main character to defeat Fenix, and their characters really merged into the film seamlessly. The characters is this film are really fused together, and each of them is interesting in their own way, and brought me no annoyance whatsoever, which bring this film stand out from the whole franchise. Verdict: The film did not let me feeling bored during the screen time, which is outstanding compared to other films in the franchise. The story is unique and a good blend between how the film established in and new genre translation. The visuals is good among the industry. What I like the most is the characters, especially the patching up between Dominic and Brian, and let both of them being hurt by both mentally and physically, really convincing they they are the main characters that are interesting. I am never a fan of a certain actor, including Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, but I will defend them if someone told me that they are not a good actor in this film. I still feel that Paul Walker himself is behind me, but this is the best film for his character, and is the best film from the character portrayed by his buddy Vin Diesel, and is one the the best film I have seen to date. Score: Story:62/100, Visuals: 89/100 Characters: 90/100 Overall feeling: 320/400 Rarity:S-",Scallopnavara,2024-10-12,2024
8.0,Thank You,"The Fast and the Furious: I liked it, first of its kind.2 Fast 2 Furious: Good sequel with Paul and Tyrese but no Vin and it was not the direct sequel that carried on from the first.Tokyo Drift: Was the unwanted third instalment that had Bow Wow and took place in densely populated Tokyo which frankly is not the place for an American action film. Fast and Furious: That should have been in Tokyo drifts spot. I find it the best in the series. The story is stronger, the whips have much more torque, the girls are freakier and they managed to get the location right this time.This was the sequel that really tore it up.",arnieiam,2009-04-07,2009
9.0,Pretty damn good.,"With this movie, I think they did a good job picking up where they left off and wrapping everything up. I have to say the cars aren't as memorable as in the original, but there were a ton of nice ones. The action was pretty sweet and the story was good. The best part was how the movie ended. I loved it. However... It just doesn't quite live up to the first, but honestly I don't think it ever had a chance. Perhaps it is part nostalgia. Maybe it was because the original was more focused on cars and the characters' first impressions. Probably because it made a decently size impression on me when I was younger. I don't know. This was good, though, and unless you fell in love with the first of this series (I am wary of using the word ""original"") you may like this one more.I just can't believe this movie has a relatively low rating, as does the first in this series. I won't take low movie ratings as seriously as I previously did.",renoskypwns,2009-12-02,2009
9.0,The stakes are going up,"The movie ""Fast and Furious 4"" is a classic representative of the genre of action and movies about cool cars, which fully justifies all the expectations of fans. The original cast returns to the series, viewers will be able to see their favorite characters again, played by Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster.The plot of the film departs a little from the original source, where we enjoyed the world of night street racing. Now the emphasis is on the criminal component, where the stakes are repeatedly raised, and the heroes will have to learn to live in a new way and go to meet dangerous opponents.The action in the film keeps the viewer's attention from start to finish, and hardcore racing in underground tunnels is simply breathtaking. The creators have put a lot of effort into creating special effects that look very spectacular and convincing.Paul Walker and Vin Diesel once again prove their acting talent and professionalism by playing their roles at the highest level. They create convincing images that will not leave any viewer indifferent. Their interaction and the dynamics of their relationship create a real chemistry on the screen, and this makes the film even more fascinating and interesting. We will see the confrontation and tension between the heroes, because the current situation allows only one of them to succeed, despite the fact that each of the heroes has their own motivation and there is no way to step back in their aspirations.Unfortunately, the main villain of the film was not impressed. His predecessor looked much more convincing in the second part of the gasoline saga. The antagonist's assistant, with whom the hero of Diesel Dominic Toretto has his own scores, looks much more convincing. It is this confrontation that is of particular interest. But the main thing in the film is wild racing and high stakes, where every mistake behind the wheel and outside it can be decisive for the characters.The acting of Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster is undoubtedly one of the main advantages of the film. They managed to create that inexplicable charm, thanks to which the viewer simply falls in love with the characters. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are an integral part of the franchise, and their tandem has long been one of the main symbols of the cult saga.One of the main advantages of ""Fast and Furious 4"" is its visual performance. The film was shot very beautifully and qualitatively, with beautiful landscapes and incredible tricks that amaze the imagination. The color palette is ready to please the viewer. At some point we will see bright chases in broad daylight, and in another case we will enjoy the dark dungeons through which the characters of the picture will drive. Director Justin Lin coped with his work at the highest level, creating a fascinating and exciting atmosphere that does not allow the viewer to relax for a minute. He has already staged a good ""Tokyo Drift"", and the man has several more pictures about ""Fast and Furious"" ahead of him. And each subsequent film will be much more amazing than the previous one.In general, ""Fast and Furious 4"" is a great movie that is definitely worth watching for all fans of the genre. It contains all the necessary elements to become a real hit: an excellent plot, spectacular stunts, good acting and beautiful visualization. This is really one of the best films in the series, which will not leave anyone indifferent.9 out of 10.",alekspredator87,2023-04-28,2023
8.0,BACK TO BASICS!!,"The previous 2 films were fun vehicles but we all know Dom and Brian make this and they are brought together by the murder of Letty so con Dom and Detective Brian team up again to find those responsible.

is some continuity errors (E. G. the scene where the 240SX was wrecked) overall, decent films.",siriphechrkulcanthr,2021-12-28,2021

7.0,"Weakest Entry In The Series, So Far","The fourth instalment in The Fast and the Furious franchise and third in line when it comes to series chronology, Fast & Furious follows the events of the second film and works its way backwards to connect with whatever transpired in Tokyo Drift. And while it does bring back the original cast, the story is so dull & forgettable that it marks a new low for this franchise.Set 5 years after the events of The Fast and the Furious, Fast & Furious tells the story of Dominic Toretto as he returns to Los Angeles after learning of a tragic news while Brian O'Conner on the other hand is now a FBI agent and has been trying to track down a Mexican drug lord. As the two meet again & realise that they have a common enemy, they team up to infiltrate into his gang.Tediously directed by Justin Lin, I get it that this sequel is Lin's attempt to close the gap he himself created between the last two instalments but apart from seeing the original cast on screen again, there is nothing worth watching in this movie. Even the chase sequences are tiring & timidly filmed, visual effects are not wholly convincing and performances by its reprising cast is an absolute letdown.On an overall scale, Fast & Furious is the weakest entry in the long-running franchise so far and everything this unnecessary sequel tries to do only ends up working against it. Despite having seen it less than 24 hours ago, I've already forgotten most of its plot, can't recall anything that was impressive about it, and never for once cared about any of its characters. Bringing nothing new to the table, Fast & Furious is a sequel on a standstill.",CinemaClown,2015-09-02,2015
7.0,Same Old Song and Dance,"Fast & Furious (2009) ** (out of 4) The fourth film in the franchise has FBI agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) teaming back up with his former friend Dominic (Vin Diesel) so that they can try and bring down a drug lord sneaking heroin into the U.S.. FAST & FURIOUS will probably be enjoyed by fans of the series and I don't think anyone could argue that the film was poorly made. There's a very professional look and feel to this but sadly it's pretty much the same thing we've seen three previous times. We get a bunch of guys acting tough and cool. We get a bunch of fast cars. We get sexy women wearing tight clothes. We get the typical bad guy. We get some fast chases and of course the biggest is going to be saved for last. One really wishes that the filmmakers had tried to do something new here but instead they just stick to the formula and clearly it worked as this film became a huge hit. As I said, the film has a very professional look to it and especially when it comes to the car chases. If you can overlook the obvious CGI wrecks, the races are actually quite good and show a lot of imagination. The imagination shown during the races is important because it not only makes them stick out but it also keeps everything from being predictable. The story itself has the typical melodrama that you'd expect as there are several old topics that the characters are upset about and of course we've got to hear them fight about them. As for as the performances go, they're pretty much what you'd expect in a film like this. Walker plays the calm and collective fine while Diesel has no problems talking and walking slow. FAST & FURIOUS isn't a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination but there's just not enough here that we haven't seen before.",Michael_Elliott,2013-05-19,2013
7.0,"No Literary Genius,Not Much Originality,But Still Fast And Still Furious.","If I am being totally honest,I only liked the first film in this series, especially after a so-so sequel and an abysmal third movie. However,this fourth installment of this franchise has completely revitalised my faith in the series, with a script that is way higher in quality compared to the others,even though it is in no way original,and some absolutely breathtaking action set-pieces.Another plus was the return of most of the original cast members.Vin Diesel seems at home behind the wheel,and his characters' pursuit for revenge of a lost loved one gives this film a serious emotional heart. The story begins with Dominic Toretto (Diesel) and his new gang, including spouse Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) earning their living by hijacking fuel trains. The opening action sequence in the Dominican Republic is an adrenaline filled piece, which sets the standard for the rest of the film. Dominic returns to America after he learns that Letty has been murdered, and crosses paths with old friend/enemy Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker),who is now an FBI agent. Dominic finds out that Letty was murdered by a man named Fenix Rise, a henchman for drug baron Arturo Braga, who coincidentally, is the baron O'Connor has been assigned to bring down. Placing their feud aside, the two join forces and conspire to destroy Braga and his operation. This film totally upped the stakes in comparison with the others,which unlike this chapter, had very little emotional drive to go alongside the great action.Alongside the great opening sequence, the film boasts a good foot chase atop of LA rooftops, a night time car chase that really gets the blood pumping, a tense border crossing from Mexico to America, and most likely the highlight for many will be the brilliant finale through the Mexican desert and through an underground tunnel. As I said before, it was great to have the original cast back, especially Jordana Brewster, who unfortunately is a little bit underused in this film, but still used the little time she had well. She looked gorgeous too. The villain was quite interesting too, you don't actually get to see Braga properly until a nice twist with half an hour to go. A special mention should be said for the score. Brian Tyler's music is amazing. It is an action packed score with tonnes of memorable cues, with one of my favourites being the ‘Letty’ cue, which is played numerous times throughout the movie, such as at Letty's funeral. Overall, this is a really entertaining movie, and is perfect for a Friday or Saturday night in. Under Justin Lin's direction, this series looks like it will only be going up judging by this movie. 8.5/10",craigmoore-3,2009-10-22,2009
7.0,Does what you know it will do and doesn't bother to do anything more than the basics,"I never set out to do it but somehow I find myself watching my fourth consecutive film in this rather undemanding franchise – proof if proof were needed that (a) the teenage dollar drives cinema and (b) I simply do not make very good decisions when faced with making decisions in a DVD store (""oh look a movie with stuff going bang – let's just get that""). In this film Letty brings Toretto back to LA where he reignites the his feud with O'Conner (now an FBI agent) as the two seek the same drug lord but for different reasons, using street racing to audition for a job running ""packages"".I can't really remember what I thought of the previous films but I'm guessing that they did the job, offering fast cars, stunts, video girls in skimpy clothes hanging off muscular and tattooed men, providing me with distraction on this basis but little else. The fourth film offered me some interest as, let's be honest, it represents a slump in the careers of all involved – especially Vin Diesel who was supposed to have gone on to claim the action hero mantel from the first film, only to fail at almost every turn and end up right back where he started. Anyway, enough of that because in theory that should not reflect on the quality of the film.This film seems like a step back towards more of a ""thriller"" that the first film was as opposed to the pop video that the series became by the time Tokyo Drift rolled round. Of course this is all relative because this film still has elements of pop video, just this time it is a touch less obvious and does deliver some reasonable action sequences. I say reasonable because the film is still nothing particularly special. The high point comes early with a rolling robbery which, while good is not as thrilling as it could have been – which doesn't bode well for the rest of the film considering this should have been a brilliant opening. As it is the film delivers the obvious but perhaps does it well enough for target audience. The cast match this aspiration and could easily have been asleep for some parts of this. Walker is a bit less bland than in other performances and does a solid enough job. Talking of solid, Diesel shows all the charisma and presence that reminds me why his career has failed to take off – he is dull in the most part. The support cast aren't really worth mentioning beyond these two – nobody does anything to really mark themselves out.A solid genre film then. Fast cars, explosions, stunts, video girls, a little bit of plot and that's your lot. Not bad per se, just the sort of film that you don't want to be making a lot of effort to see – because that effort will not be repaid here.",bob the moo,2010-02-20,2010
7.0,Glad to see Diesel & Walker back together,"Fast and the Furious is NOT Fast and the Furious without Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. Having said that, there have only been TWO F&F movies – the original and the 2009 release.As with the first, I loved the story of enduring friendship despite being on the opposing sides in this release. I also felt Diesel's emotional struggle, but didn't feel Walker was able to convey whatever internal conflicts he was experiencing (with work, with Jordana) well enough and felt the movie lacking in that acting aspect. Diesel & Walker could also have had better scenes together. I don't know if it was the lack of heart in acting or the lack of scenes together, but I somehow felt the connection among the movie characters could have been better.However, there were a good bunch of interesting characters – Fenix, Campos, the other FBI officer Bryan keeps crossing paths with, heck, even Bryan's assistant in the FBI was entertaining! I'm looking forward to seeing Han in the sequels, though I'm not sure how they'll resolve his character considering he's supposed to have died in the 3rd movie.I too felt more race scenes could have made it a better film, though I must say I enjoyed the city race! I've always liked Vin Diesel & Paul Walker. It was just a little bit less Fast & Furious for me, but still an entertaining film I enjoyed very much.",dally-d-dalisay,2009-04-19,2009
7.0,Hollywood Trademark,"As expected from a Hollywood movie in general and the makers of The and Furious in particular this time, the ""bad guy"" is traditionally a perfect Christian ... bravo Hollywood, NEVER miss an opportunity to insult a religion especially one that is defenseless in the Media of the USA, Canada, most of Europe ........ , imagine if they made the ""BAD GUY"" a Muslim or if they committed the ultimate Hollywood blasphemy of making him a good Zionist Jew, what would the Media have done with the makers, probably lead to a ban of the movie, IF it had not been killed in production the Hollywood likes of those movies are countless if you should really look, not just 1 or 2. And to the people who were trained to think that I'm a racist and Anti-Semite etc ... , I tell them that a my Jewish friends agree with me , as for myself, I'm a Semite, and NO, NOT ALL SEMITES ARE JEWS Islamic Terrorists have more respect for other people's religions than Hollywood Terrorists, and that you are receiving from someone LIVING in the middle east , not watching it through finely filtered news, WAKE UP !!!",tskyhopper,2009-04-10,2009
