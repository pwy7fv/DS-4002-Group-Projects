10.0,Definitely much better than Roper and Leno painted it!,"For one thing, the caption that identifies the jetliner as landing at Tokyo International Airport was very useful. Because, otherwise, ALL THAT SCENE SHOWED WAS A JETLINER LANDING! Something that could have been stock footage shot at some other airport, for some other movie, over the last twenty years. Secondly; the writers of this movie tell a completely new story (for the most part). No overseas assignment for FBI Agent Conner, the lead-footed undercover guy from the first two flicks. Nope! We get a whole new lead-foot, named Sean Boswell. A navy brat whose parents are divorced: the mom living in Texas. And, the dad living in Tokyo. The street-racing segment that gets Sean exiled to Japan is refreshingly realistic, with regard to the consequences (both medical and legal). So, too, is Sean's ‘fish-out-water’ feeling, during his first day in a school where English is REALLY a second language! That's where he meets Twinkie (an African-American army brat and Donald Trump wanna-be) And, through him, Han: a Chinese-American expatriate who is both rival and business partner of ‘DK’ Takashi (nephew of a local yakuza bigwig). The ‘Romeo and Juliet’ thing that develops between Sean and Neela (Takashi's half-gaijin girlfriend) is admittedly a little predictable. But, the way they start to get to know each other isn't any more far-fetched than, say, Ren McCormick and Ariel Shaw, in the deservedly classic ‘Footloose.’ Two strangers in a strange land, getting to know each other, and building up gradually, from there. But, the street-racing sequences are, of course, the main attraction. I admire the stunt doubles who REALLY handled the driving in those scenes! I certainly don't envy them, however. Especially, the climactic race down that Japanese mountain road. Hoo-boy! I swear: I got vertigo just WATCHING those shots of what waited just beyond each cliffside curve. I guess the only other thing I can say, in favor of this movie, is the uncredited cameo towards the end. You continuity addicts will love it. *Insert mischievous snickering here.*",Carycomic,2006-06-16,2006
9.0,Good movie elevated by awesome action.,"This movie has to be the most entertaining thing i have seen all year even though i still think the first one was better. But moving it to Tokyo was a smart move as this brings a fresh atmosphere. Some of the acting was terrible but what do you expect. Lucas Black is a likable replacement for Paul Walker and Bow Wow does okay. Some of the Japanese actors are really good, but the real stars are the cars and boy do they look good, they go from show ponies - twink's car to awesome drift cars- Han's car. The action sidepieces are totally amazing the action goes from good to great through the movie. Over all this is an awesome popcorn movie and i recommend it to everyone just for the action and the big surprise at the end!! 10 out of 10",the_con_man298,2006-06-16,2006
5.0,eh...,"if you like minimum plot concern, tricked-out cars, Japan, Japanese mafia, Japanese girls(Harijuku girls especially) and drift racing... go for it. the oldest kid from the Home Imporvement sitcom makes his first appearance since First Kid as a cocky jock, i thought that was worth a good chuckle in the theater. too many special effects, half of them were in there for suspense... but they weren't so believable if you've watched drift racing. there was one chase scene where they skidded through traffic and inbetween cars... to me it felt that they tried to push a whole lot of drift racing into some of the action scenes.",sketchbook_romance,2006-06-16,2006
10.0,The fats and the furious Tokyo drift,"I saw fast and the furious Tokyo drift today it was an excellent movie and i'd love to see it again. It did include Vin Diesel although he wasn't a main character it least the director tried to include him. The cars were gorgeous and i thought while i was watching it i want to be like them i want to be a car racer. Which i've always wanted to do but now i want to be a racer even more. Of course these films must influence people like me to want to be like them and race cars and drift. But also it makes you change your mind as Han, Shawns friend dies in it which made me want to cry. He died when they were racing and D.K was racing after them. Then the car was burning and Shawn was walking up to it and it exploded. This was the saddest part of the movie. The movie was fantastic and when i buy it on DVD i'm probably going to be up watching it every night! They had fantastic cars in the movie my favourite was the Nissan 350Z which D.K at the beginning of the movie drove. The cars were gorgeous and when i'm 17 i'm going to have my driving test in a Nissan 350Z on my birthday. To sum the movie up it was a brilliant movie and there was some gorgeous guys and cars. Also the music was great and i hope they bring out a soundtrack for the film. Lucas Black was always fantastic in this movie as well as Nathalie Kelley i hope the next one comes out soon and the DVD comes out soon because i want to watch it every day. I also hope Lucas Black and Nathalie Kelley are in the next ones. Also Lucas Black seemed more tough then Paul Walker. Thankyou for your co-operation. If you have not yet seen the movie. SEE IT!!! Its the best one so far! Its also my favourite movie ever now!!!!!!",igraynelewis,2006-06-16,2006
5.0,Eye Candy just like the other 2,"Fun, Fast and Flashy. Like the other 2 it mostly ignores physics and completely ignores common sense. The drifting is cool but better in person with real professionals. I think a good half of the drifting in this was CG. Hell there was more ""real"" drifting in the Dukes of Hazard remake.Finally I think the most annoying part was during the major chase through Tokyo none of these drivers ""drove"" to get away. Drifting is NOT the fastest way through a corner, so if your running from someone why would you drift.Any way, I enjoyed it but if you like cars or racing, and have a average understanding of both, your gonna be shaking your head a lot.",Physicker,2006-06-16,2006
6.0,"Hans Prequel, Already made.","Hans prequel has already been made, I guess none of us never knew about it .check out Better Luck Tomorrow : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0280477/ I'm gonna go try and rent it tonight if its around here.Well apparently i need at least 10 lines of text... Apparently this movie IS the pequel to what han did before fast and the furious 3. I don't know if it has a younger version of...you know who. but I'm hoping it does, I'd also Love to see how hans life started off in the drifting world.",forestfeet,2006-06-16,2006
1.0,Disappointing to say the least.,"For being an American movie on a Japanese concept, I first expected it to be a mess. But after checking out the movie website I saw that they did some homework, so I had moderate-low expectations going in. And with those expectations, I was rather disappointed. It was no Shuto Kousoku Trial and I'm well surprised that Keiichi Tsuchiya dared have anything to do with it.For starters the dialogue was terrible generic canned phrases all through the movie, but that was to be expected of a mainstream Hollywood production. Most notably would have to be the camera work which is the choppiest work I've ever seen done. In an attempt to make scenes more dramatic and appear faster than they were, the fast camera movement only wound up leaving the viewer with mere pieces of what was going on, rather than conveying an actual scene; it wasn't styled either, it was just bad. Even for being obviously low budget (canned dialogue, little scenery, etc.) the plot was clearly quite formulaic and the main character simply embarrassing to watch. I don't even want to start on the hair-thin plot and unnecessary sexualization. Maybe I've just grown out of that junk.There were, however, two or three good (yet painfully brief) scenes that just had a good feeling to the way they were done (like they kept the camera still for more than a second and combined elements like plot and environment). Also, the character Han is fantastic in his Japanese manner of doing things, but his character is ruined by two significant events, the first of which is something he does that is unfortunately way out of character. That's what brings this movie up to a 3/10 rating for me.",soulshinobi,2006-06-16,2006
8.0,Better than 1 and 2,"It's easy to beat 2, so that isn't saying much. However, in my mind it is even better than the first. Neither necessarily has a great storyline, though number 1 had the most likely one. However, where the first one failed, Tokyo Drift delivers.People don't go see movies like this for substance and content. They go to see cars race. Autophiles and racers go to see the tricked out cars and hear the names of their suppliers being used on the big screen. The first installment in this series used a lot a jargon unknown to non to non-racers, and to those who were in the know, the movie was a joke. Tokyo Drift gets away from all the pretenses and delivers what the truth is: few people use Nitrous Oxide, and racers drive because they love it, money or none, just to see who is the best.The cars are great. It was wonderful too see the makes and models you are used to seeing out there, instead of all these tricked out high priced rice racers. The best cars to race aren't necessarily the most expensive. The racing was more about skill than power, and that's the truth. First off the line means jack if you don't know your wheels. The racing scenes are top notch. Gone are the shaky camera angles and digitally enhanced shots of cars flying by at 140mph with nitrous in full bore. Instead, we get cool shots using cell phones, and up close angles of vehicles gliding across pavement and narrowly missing the camera. The action shots are wonderful, and many are real shots, not computer digitized as referenced by the end credits begging us not to go out and attempt these stunts that were performed on closed roads by professional drivers. We're not talking your standard danger tag, we're talking full size text on it's own screen. These drifters are for real, and that just enhances the feel for the film.Finally, and parents will love this, it is relatively clean. I don't think i heard a single f-bomb in the whole movie. I'm not saying that there is no cussing, but that it is so moderate and background oriented, that you can watch the movie and not even remember hearing it. There are about 5 or 6 kissing scenes, and only one contains a semi-main character. The worst content you will see here is skimpy outfits.This is just a fun, fun movie. It's not going to win any awards, but it has definitely set itself up to top the original in box office gross and will no doubt surpass 2 fast 2 furious. Don't be afraid to take the 13+ kidding to see this, though under 8-10 may be pushing it, unless they really understand cars and racing.",deac0n_fr0st,2006-06-16,2006
10.0,Beautiful Film,"At first, I wasn't sure how Justin Lin could pull off the whole drifting scene and make a story out of it. I went in with high hopes and left even happier. Lucas Black has another great performance in another great film. He has a bright future ahead of him. Every racing sequence in this film is amazingly done and is all real. In the first two films, you could notice that the racing sequences were all done on a computer. Here, you can tell it's really happening. I highly recommend that the car lovers should go see this film. Especially if you love drifting. I'm a fan of all types of racing and I loved this film. I know I'll be making another trip back to see it. Also, the first racing sequence is AMAZING. It's pretty accurate to how a race could start. I give this film, a 9 out of 10.",fenderbass2122,2006-06-16,2006
5.0,decent,possible spoilers The whole movie was great until about the end. There was a good plot line and everything. then they take an American classic a early to late 70's ford mustang gt and put a Nissan engine in it. i realize some of you may not get this but i am the biggest fan of muscle cars. this pisses me off so much. i do not know what the hell they were thinking The main point of the movie though was good and the plot lines were done well. i do believe that they will do another movie to wrap up the series including Vin diesel and Dom torentto. i think that there idea of releasing a commerical ruined the surprise but there was a big competition between that and nacho libre.,Pschmeiser,2006-06-16,2006
10.0,It was a great movie!,This movie was the best!! I am so going to buy it when it comes out! I think the writers of the movie should make many more of Fast and the Furious movies and the next 1 should have Paul Walker!!Vin Diesel! nd Lucas Black!!!!! all in the same movie. That would be so0o0 awesome nd it should be in Europe!!! That would be great!Well everybody told me they enjoyed this movie nd so did I. Well I really am going to be waiting for another one coming out.. with Lucas Black in it. Man was Lucas Black hot in this movie!!Well yea I'm really going to buy this movie without a doubt on my mind!I mean the cars were hot and everything was hot in this movie!,Dlife921,2006-06-16,2006
10.0,this movie was off the hook it was better then the first 2,"The Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift not only contained evos, skylines and the vielside Mazda rx7 it contained a lot of hot girls and for u guys that like classic cars it contained that. The 67 mustang they supped up wit a skyline engine was crazy and i know everyone will fall in love with it. Also a great ending it just never stopped wit the action the whole audience was going crazy at the end wit Vin diesal return but its only for like 2 mins, but this movie u will be on the edge of ur seats. This one was much better then the 2nd movie and just a little bit better then the first but the lead actor black is the next Paul walker this movie rocked.",ballermm,2006-06-16,2006
10.0,Running in the 90's.,"Way better than the first two, though the lead actor had this mid-western accent which threw me off a little. Some of the drifting was unrealistic, but the storyline wasn't all hip-hop'd out with stupid walking styles and saying ‘breh’ and ‘brah’ at the end of every sentence. The Teriyaki boyz' theme song was good, the storyline was pretty good and the girls are hot of course. If anyone has seen the Initial D movie, then this movie is better than that one. There is a little love story kind of, but most of it is drifting action. Keiichi Tsuchiya (the real, one and only Drift King) makes an appearance in it as an old man fishing ‘You call that drifting?",blackdakkon,2006-06-16,2006
10.0,intense car chases leaving you on the edge of your seat!,"wow.. i had my thoughts about this movie.. i liked the first 1.. i watched half of the second one and i quite watching it half way in it.. and now were at the third one.. when it started i was like interesting. about not even 5 minutes in the movie, we see one of the many car chases/races that will leave you on the edge of your seat. for people that didn't think this movie had a story, it sure did, and it flowed good. the theathre was full and i don't think anyone left but i was too focused on the movie.. i can well say it was well worth the admission price. i highly recommend this for car racing fans or someone looking for a lot of action. 10/10!",video_game_lover_122,2006-06-16,2006
10.0,Blew Me Away,"There is no doubt that automobile racing is becoming an obsession in many parts of the world, including Japan, it seems. Tokyo is a city full of lights and music and also a dark side, including gangsters and reckless racers, much like the untamed America of the prohibition era. Lucas Black, a rebellious Alabama teen racer, is sent to his father in Tokyo to settle down. Instead, Lucas learns the sport of ""drift racing"" from Japanese gangster youth in which racers use spinning tires and their brakes to make fast turns around the curves of parking garages and mountain roads. Those who aspire to win smiles from the foxy Japanese girls and the admiration of Japanese males have to win these drifting contests. Despite a steep learning curve, young Lucas does not disappoint in this matter. This movie has superb photography of the beautiful people and stirring landscapes of Tokyo. The exciting action and inspiring music have to be experienced to be believed. The ensemble of young men and women does a great job of providing a glimpse of this advanced culture of modern Japanese youth, overflowing with style and passion. This movie skillfully shows off modern Japan as perhaps a neglected subject of cinema. And, the well-crafted and intricate plot is full of teenage rivalry and violence, similar to an updated ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" very fascinating and passionate.",phillipstephenso,2006-06-16,2006
8.0,The Series gets better and better,"When I first heard about The Fast and The Furious 3 from this site I was thrilled. I checked every week for new info. When i went to see it I thought it was the best of the lot. I thought the first race was equally as good as the last. I found with the other 2 the attention moved off the races and onto other things e.g. Carlos Verone, Monica Vuentas and Mia Toretto. I personally thought the twist at the end with Dom was a perfect ending despite not actually seeing the race. I have also found out the connection between Han and Torretto. After Dom's brief with Letty in Mexico they returned to California where Johnny Trent's car gang was falling apart and then Han transfered from johnny to Dominic where they raced for about a year. Thats about when Han returned to japan and Dom went around the time Shaun beat D.K. (The Japanese version of Justin Timberlake).",gedders2006,2006-06-17,2006
9.0,Absolutely Awesome,"If you liked either of the previous Fast and Furious movies, see this movie. If you like cars, see this movie. If you like hot girls, see this movie. I'll grant that the plot isn't super intensive, but the mix of plot intertwined with action was great. I think that the 2 Fast 2 Furious plot of 'cops and drugs' has been used a little too much, and yet that movie still had redeeming features. I don't know why there is so many people who think it wasn't worth the money. Lets face it. There are VERY few movies that have: great plots, Awesome action, and very hot chicks. I watch movies a lot and i have only seen - at most - 5 movies that have the above content. It also depends on the viewer and their preferences. If your confused about whether you want to see Tokyo Drift or not, my advice is to ignore what anybody says about it and to just go and watch it for yourself and decide whether it was or wasn't worth it.",mutated_carcass,2006-06-17,2006
7.0,Solid,"I have seen the other reviews of this film that are negative and I just don't understand. This is no high concept, high-brow. This is girls, cars and loud soundtrack. What did you think it was going to be? Some great racing scenes. This could have easily just been another racing for cash film, but it actually was smart in pulling in the drift scene. Same cars, but different style of racing.Overall I thought the characters were fun. Again, nothing high concept here. Just enough info for you to separate the good guys and bad guys. Throw in a little romance and there you have the formula that made the other two films in this franchise hits.",RCWjr,2006-06-17,2006
1.0,Worst movie ever,"For a time I didn't know which movie I had as number 1 worst movie, but now I do :) The scene where they ride downhill and try to make it ""lovestory"" kinda like, I was so embarrassed that I had to close my eyes and ears. Worst dialog ever :P Worst casting to by the way, Lucas Black gotta be one of the worst actors I've seen in a long time, what was with the accent, bad smile and stupid grin ? Every time he said something deep was just hilarious, that guy cant act for sure. Even the scenes with drifting got boring, cause its the same and same all over again, from start to end. BoooooringMy few words :)Over and out",maeha,2006-06-17,2006
9.0,Was much better than 2Fast 2Furious but with small flaws...,"I thought that the movie was awesome. However, there were some minor set backs which made me think ""now that is stupid"". To start off, I thought that Bow Wow should not have been in the movie, but he did do a good job. I just think it is stupid that they had to get someone famous like that for that part... Another thing...Shawn Boswell was a great actor but his country southern accent seemed too fake. It seemed like he was 'trying to hard' if you know what I mean. Last thing for now...Vin Diesel's appearance was not needed. It was just really stupid how he just showed up for 10 seconds! Anyways, to make a review short, it is a great movie and you should see it if you liked (or didn't!) the first or second Fast and Furious.",FlyersPh9,2006-06-17,2006
8.0,It is a very entertaining movie.,"OK, I walked in expecting another fake street racing movie. The first Fast and the Furious was quite entertaining. The second just felt like a 90 minute commercial sponsored by Mitsubishi and Yearone. Honestly, this movie was really great, it felt really good to watch. You can really connect with the main character(Lucas Black). I dunno, you can sense a lot of sincerity in his character. He loves what he does and thats it. The jump from drag to drifting doesn't seem to really get to him. The fact that this movie doesn't rely on the cars as the main characters is really great. The acting itself in this movie was wonderful. I love watching a good classic movie just like the rest, but sometimes you just need to see some mindless car scenes and unwind a bit. Oh, the other thing I loved was the cameos! We have the original drift king with his one liners. Funny. We also have the so ever popular Sonny Chiba(aka the swordsman from Kill Bill). Last and not least, Vin Diesel is back",jin_ecko72,2006-06-17,2006
3.0,"Lackluster plot, brainless bimbos, & Some Rotten Acting","Well I never had the intention to see this movie, but my friend who has no taste in movies implored me to accompany him to this movie that promises to bring in a marginally slim profit. So a disrespectful adolescent is sentenced to go to his father who lives in Tokyo when he is apprehended by the local police when he decimates a construction site. For reasons I do not know, he was not incarcerated, apparently he can just be relocated. In Japan he in pulled into the ‘underground’ of competitive racing that incorporates a technique called drifting, I suppose no one on the continent of North America had ever had the notion of drifting before. So then while he is in this strange land he falls for the girl who's boyfriend is the nephew of the don of the Yakuza. Uh-OH, bit trouble! There's animosity, so how does it get resolved? By the means of a race! The race sequences are intriguing at first, but later they just become repetitive and use an endless string of shots that just disorientate the audience to create the cheap illusion of insane speed. The dialog isn't too much too look at, I almost died when the cliché of ‘let's end this once and for all’ was used to prompt the ‘final showdown’. Something else that I could not wrap my mind around is that the girls are not only flat out promiscuous in this renegade's dreamland, but also that they can be one over something as trivial as a car race. The director did a decent job, but a lot of his techniques were pretty minimalistic. But perhaps the most annoying aspect of this movie was the southern hick accent that was laid on pretty thick by Lucas Black. All in all, this is just going to be one of those movies that will fade into the obscurity of Action section in the back of Blockbuster video. If you want to walk away from a movie and feel fulfilled, just wait for Superman Returns and save yourself $7.50",boxybrown13,2006-06-17,2006
6.0,Give it a chance...,I'm giving this a 10 because it was SO MUCH BETTER than I thought it would be. I didn't think I could get past Lucas Black's heavy accent. He toned it down to a believable one that didn't get in the way of the story.This film moves quickly and doesn't stray too long on dialog and kissy-face. (Was there any?) The folks that gave this movie a 1 out of 10 obviously didn't see and don't like the franchise and feel that they can bash a movie in 10 lines or more and feel better about it. Those people should just go watch South Park and stop whining. This movie is entertainment in the purest form. I will see it again in the theaters soon.,wilkinsd-1,2006-06-18,2006
4.0,expected better,"Tonight I watched the fast and the furious: Tokyo Drift.The drifting is fun to watch, but a campy plot and too much development time makes attempting to deepen an already shallow storyline seem much too overbearing. The acting, while not terrible is nothing great and the character's personalities are forced and way over the top. While this isn't a big surprise to anyone who has watched the other movies in series, the lack of well known cast members made it more apparent then usual. Plus, there is almost no police intervention in this one. even as a car drifts into a massive crowd of people and seconds later explodes, causing chaos.Apparently in Tokyo, the police don't mess with street racers because they can't catch them. Seriously, that's how it's explained.On the plus side of things, plenty of eye-candy can be found everywhere, and I'm not just talking about the cars. Japanese women are all portrayed as beautiful and stylish import girls, and their tiny vinyl skirts are just about as shiny as the finish on the cars. One thing must be said though. Japanese men are no where near as pretty as their women here. I'm sure some will disagree, but wow. Someone get those boys a mirror.Overall, it's not a dreadful film as there are some high points particularly during some racing stunts, but it's odd how young everyone is. Appparently the lead character isn't even out of high school. Right from the introduction the film generalizes what audience this movie geared towards. What makes this even dumber is how what they are doing is illegal. Bunch of kids disobeying the law and the cops could care less.It's rather mediocre for the most part and the only thing compelling me to recommend it for would be the racing, but i feel that there isn't even enough of that to balance this movie out.Pretty disappointing.",thefuzmixman,2006-6-1,2006
7.0,yes the acting is bad ... it's a car movie,"I don't know why this movie got a 4.7. I saw Nacho Libre last night, and aside from a few hederian gimmicks that (embarrasingly) made me laugh, I found myself asleep by the time he ""ran to the wilderness"". Nacho wasn't just dumb ... It was 100% worse than utterly boring.""Tokyo Drift"", on the other hand, had a lot to offer. Sure it was like candy ... fast cars, danger, fire, guns, women, nice street shots of Tokyo, and Sonny Chiba as a Yakuza boss... but at least it knew what it was ... a corny car movie only out entertain. Hey, I'm a guy ... what can I say. Besides that, it's Fast and Furios for goodness sake .. what were you expecting, Bullit? Nacho just tried to hard to be some clever indie movie, and frankly all those dirty-nerdy temptations from childhood were already explored in Dynamite and are now best left hidden away in the past. Nacho tried to be something. But something it was not. And with it's cast and ""pret-indie"" (my term so y'all better give me credit) look, it wasn't even an indie flick.If I had to put the two side by side in a race, my 10 bucks would be on Tokyo Drift. It's a good movie for the big screen. Wait for Nacho to come out on video, so you ""walk out of the movie"" without feeling bad about having gone to the theater.Despite the previews, there's nothing redeeming about Jack Black flexing his buttocks in those white pants. The rest of that scene is so dumb I wanted to stick a corn cob in my eye.",kimchimofo,2006-06-18,2006
5.0,the fast and the furious Tokyo drift,"i saw the fast and the furious. the movie is not really as great as it is supposed to be. The main character, sounds like Cletus, the slack jawed yokel. There are moments in the movie where the director intends some scenes to be very powerful and emotional but the performances, given by the actors are mediocre and average at best. Unless you are total rev - head fan and would like to sit through all the unconvincing performances for nearly two hours just to see the cars, then this is the movie for you. if you are someone who likes to actively engage with the story, forget this movie and save your money. The other thing that is wrong with this movie is that they cast bow wow as the sidekick. he is just as bad as the will smith and the martin Lawrence partnership in bad boys 2. the one notable exception are the two characters, drift king and Han - who serves as a mentor for our friend. who incidentally looks like he has been hit with a shovel",pinapati2,2006-06-18,2006
8.0,The Best Thus Far,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift took me by complete surprise. The movie completely redeemed the series following the Too Fast, Too Furious fiasco. Although the movie does not contain the appealing American muscle cars of the first title, the eloquent interpretation of drifting as a racing style (art form)and the culmination of turbo charged 350 Z's and RX7's,lets the picture differ from the typical concept of headstrong American drag racing. Decent acting and an even better storyline, allows the viewer to embrace the techniques in Japanese underground racing. Plus, Vin Diesel's cameo is ridiculously bad ass.",irishprd88,2006-06-18,2006
6.0,"Not award winning material, but decent.","Lets get one thing clear, you are not going to a Fast and Furious movie for the groundbreaking plot and acting, you go for the cars, the racing, and the babes. Tokyo Drift is basically the same if not a little better than the previous two as far as the racing is concerned. There is the street racing that the series is famous for but also the addition of drift racing, which adds a new bit of spice to the flavor. As I mentioned the acting and the plot are so so at best, not something you will be groaning over but not enough to really drag you in and connect you with the characters. However it is my opinion that the plot here is better than in the second movie. Lucas Black from Friday night Lights replaces Paul Walker as the main character here, and Bow Wow is along for the ride as the trusty friend/sidekick. A few cameos from other actors and movies are thrown in as well. From beginning to end this movie does hold your interest with the racing, and for that the weak plot and questionable acting can be forgiven. Cars get wrecked, punches get thrown, loud music is played, and the hero has to do what he thinks is right. Bottom line, if you enjoyed the previous two, or even enjoy car racing movies at all you should get some entertainment value out of this one. Not the best movie to ever grace the silver screen, but I had a good time.",madmax_thegamer,2006-06-18,2006
9.0,From someone who has reviewed more than ONE movie ever,"I'm not sure why this movie didn't spark the interest that the other FATF movies did but I think this is the best one of the three. The cinematography was awesome, the women are gorgeous. The villain was believable, it has almost non-stop action, and some genuinely funny lines. I never believe any reviews from anyone that has only reviewed one movie because they obviously have an agenda in either over hyping or needlessly trashing a movie. What I don't understand is why isn't anyone putting legitimate critiques up of this movie. The weakest point in this movie is trying to swallow that a guy w/ a southern accent could so instantly be accepted and trusted in a prominent drift club in Tokyo. OK suspend that disbelief and this move MOVES! I never once felt bored or lost or clicked my tongue and rolled my eyes like I did in the last FATF movie. Maybe people were hoping for more of the same trash, I'm not sure but this is an above average, I'd even say exciting, summer race film not like many others. I hope this sparks some other real reviews.",yoncenator,2006-06-18,2006
10.0,Correcting the above person and some things i thought about the movie,"There weren't any HUGE glaring inaccuracies (other than daddy throwing sonny the keys to a car with NO ENGINE in it...) < WHAT YOU SAID IS INCORRECT. The Car he received from his dad had no engine, But he had put another car's engine into the car. It was shown in the movie. The movie was pretty good. I do like cars and if you like cars also you should see the movie. The action was good all around which made it a good movie. Drifing is pretty cool and if you would like to see how drifting is you should also see the movie. I give this movie a 10 because it shows how drifting is.",BksNinja,2006-06-18,2006
1.0,"Horrible movie,","Possible spoiler warningThis movie was horrible as I kind of predicted it would be. The lack of reasonable plot and plot holes spoiled it.As a Navy brat that lived in Japan when I was a kid, I for a fact know that Navy kids do not attend Japanese schools, they attend American schools. Navy officers do not live in shacks in Tokyo, they live on the base, because they get big houses for 25% of the price. In Tokyo drift they do neither of these things. I'm almost 100% sure that the Yakuza have no interest whatsoever in drifting. They'd prefer to be making money. I'm also sure that not every drift car in Japan is sponsored and covered with stickers. As a person who is/was pasionate about the sport of drifting, the way this movie portrayed it was a joke. Basically this was another attempt by Hollywood to grab onto pop culture and warp it to their ends to make money. I fear all it will lead to is idiot kids killing themselves and others.",onig-1,2006-06-18,2006
4.0,"Not Much Of A Movie, Although Lucas Black Is Good.","Let me be honest and say I saw this film solely because Lucas Black was in it. I like his tough look and sweet Alabama drawl, but despite his presence and a couple of good driving stunts, this is a nothing movie. It's reminiscent of the ‘Stock Car Race’ movies from film companies like American International Pictures that were commonplace when I was a kid. While I am usually willing to do it, too much suspension of disbelief was expected of me for my own enjoyment. Lucas Black is about 24; he cannot play a seventeen year old. The story of the film would still have worked if Sean, (Black's character) was his real chronological age. They could even have used the same plot device of him wrecking a housing development in an illegal race and that is why he's sent to stay with his dad in Japan instead of going to jail. But to pretend that Sean is 17 is just dumb. Nobody would give that much credence to a 17 year old no matter how tough. The ‘Tokyo Drift’ part is also kind of dumb. It seems to be a driving stunt wherein you propel the car forward in a sideways position. This is used to a fun effect with the drivers getting to the top of a parking garage and all, but this ‘drifting’ as it's called I have seen before in stock car races. I've seen it in James Bond movies and in last years The Dukes Of Hazard movie. In fact, ‘drifting’ is the whole major plot point in the Pixar film Cars and in Owen Wilson's inability to do it well. In fact, watching the drifting in The Dukes Of Hazard was better because it was filmed with longer shots. Director Justin Lin does too much MTV style quick cutting and it gets annoying. That kind of rapid cutting really only works in limited doses, it is tiring over the length of a feature film. Besides, in The Dukes Of Hazard, I had the feeling that the stunt people were actually driving the cars, in this its one cut after another and you don't get any sense of the cars being driven. The scene where about ten cars come ‘drifting’ down a mountain road is cool, but the story is still dumb. Too bad, I really want to see Lucas Black in something better. There is something very attractive and real about him that has yet to be tapped. He has a no nonsense demeanor that could work very well on screen, like a cross between Charles Bronson and Jimmy Stewart. I know that sounds like an odd mix, but I think it can work. I think he can be a star, even though that might not be what he wants.",Michael-70,2006-06-18,2006
9.0,Drop your preconceptions and judge this movie on its own merits,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I have seen the other two in the franchise, and I thought the second one sucked. I had better hopes for this one simply based on the location in Tokyo, which I think is the most fascinating city in the world. I wanted to watch the movie just to see images of the city. If the movie happened to be decent, well then that would just be a bonus. Boy was I pleasantly surprised at how good this film was! This movie is pure entertainment. The cinematography is gorgeous, and really reveals Tokyo as a futuristic city. The racing scenes are amazing. The character development is there, and you actually are intrigued by the main characters. There is plenty of eye candy to go around. I was gripped the whole time by this movie. Even if you didn't like the other F&F movies, I think you should give this one a chance. It definitely has more depth to it than the others.",bthuynh,2006-06-18,2006
10.0,what this film should be judged on,This is first and foremost an action film you do not watch it for the characters and story you watch it for the action and for the thrills and in this aspect the fast and furious tokyo drift definitely delivers. The action scenes have a real sense of speed. They also give you a real sense of danger and you never know what is coming next.It also contains some very nice cars i am not really into the Japanese tuning seen but this film contains every kind of car from nissans to mustangs to volkswagens there really is something for everyone!In conclusion if you want a film with in depth story and characters look elsewhere but if you want a good thrilling action movie then the fast and the furious tokyo drift is certainly worth watching.,gavin_2003,2006-06-18,2006
6.0,Ummm....OK I guess,"Going into this movie I had the lowest expectations ever. I mean Bow wow is in it. Couldn't they have gotten some better actors like Vin Diesel or Paul Walker, like in the first two? No, they got Bow Wow. Well I went in with very very low expectations and walked thinking it wasn't too bad. It was an o.k. overdone action movie I'll give it that. The acting was quite cheesy and the movie itself was predictable. But at the same time it did have some very nice(nice, not possible) racing scenes that I did enjoy. Another thing was that I totally didn't feel the fast and the furious ""feeling"" throughout this one, as I did during the first two. It just doesn't quite follow the same theme and guidelines. But its a guaranteed favorite for all those die hard action movie lovin people, jus wasn't all that great with me.",maxgunko,2006-06-18,2006
8.0,Does what you expect,"Alright, let's get this out of the way: if you have no interest in cars, don't bother. If you want moving, powerful acting performances, look elsewhere. If blow-off valves and spinning tires make your heart shift into high gear, this is your kind of movie. The story is wafer-thin, it serves only as a hasty explanation to bring the audience to the Tokyo location and set up some action addicted races. The acting is just decent enough to keep you from groaning constantly, though Sung Kang's role as Han stands out as memorable and pleasant. Lucas Black has an understated quality about him that I think allows the movie's merit of its stunt sequences to shine, rather than the lead trying to steal all the attention. Which leaves me with the car play--the writers thankfully stopped trying to be technical and accurate in terms or facts (for the most part), so there's no ""...Blow the welds on your intake..."" crap, which is just plain wrong. The stunt drivers delivered lots of jaw-dropping drifts and high octane chases, and Justin Lin and his second-unit director took great care in highlighting the automotive lunacy. The cars and the setting are all glossy and colorful, and there is a wide range of makes and models to drool over, all just a bit over the top in their appearance. The music matches the speed of the movie as well, getting the target audience fired up with rock, hip-hop, and electronic tracks in all the right spots. Simply put, this movie offers what it promises, and gets by on the rest. I'm one of those types who can look past the shortcomings for the vehicular excitement, so I loved it, despite the flaws.",carlsob,2006-06-18,2006
8.0,It was better than the second one but not as good as the first,OK this is for the comment above about the navy brat ! For a start neither of them was a navy brat. Shaun was sent to Tokyo to avoid going to jail back in the states. I agree that the plot was rather terrible but apart from that it was good. Japs invented drifting so i think you are wrong mate. The only thing that was wrong with this film was that it didn't have a wide enough range of cars that it could of done like the previous ones. All you saw was 350 z and a skyline now and then. Don't get me wrong the s15 (which was actually a s13 that had been converted) was rather nice but a bit pathetic when he opened the hood and you saw the s13 engine ha ha. The Evo was rather nice and the Rx7. What was with Bow Wows car man. WTF Wat that ha ha. Rite mess. But overall worth watching. I personally think they could have done a better job or maybe even relate it to the previous ones. But no they had to do this. Ah well was disappointed but like I've said definitely worth watching.,zoe_loves_richard,2006-06-19,2006
9.0,Better than the others,"I have to say, the movie was definitely better than the trailer. That's a rarity nowadays. This movie had action from start to finish. I couldn't and didn't even get up to use the restroom!! The movie had gorgeous guys, beautiful girls and off the hook music. That's the way it is with racing in the real world. The plot was realistic. It had enough to keep the movie goer watching. The cars were off...the...hook...!! And last but definitely not least...the end of the movie..the best part of the whole movie. When they tell Sean he has someone who wants to race him and they show that car with the sound system blasting the best Don Omar song in the streets right now...crazy!!!! And the driver? Man please, this flick was off da meter....",marisela537,2006-06-19,2006
10.0,Lucas Black is a hit in new Fast and Furious flick,"I enjoyed watching this new movie of The Fast and The Furious. Lucas Black seemed to capture the spotlight in the movie. His character's background was entertaining. The ending is unexpected, but INTERESTING.Great movie.The only disadvantage of the movie is the storyline seems to drift off occasionally. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone that is into fast paced movies and also into the auto aspect. Nicer cars compared to the first to movies. No subtitles, which makes the movie, slightly confusing but you'll get the gist of it all.The trailer didn't do the movie any justice. It has a slight father & son bonding moment, brings some moments to heart.",sprtsmedchik,2006-06-19,2006
5.0,like a book amongst the many on the shelf,"The Fast and the Furious,first movie, was okay. I'm not a big VD fan.Too Fast Too Furious was surprisingly very entertaining. Both Walker and his co-star did a good job. With Tokyo Drift, Walker is gone and in comes 24 year old, Lucas Black with Bow Wow (Mr. yawn-fest) The first fifteen or so minutes of this film are wild. Sean(the lead) is sent to Tokyo so that he can avoid himself getting into trouble. In Tokyo, he meets Bow Wow and they become good friends quickly to get the story to move along. Of course, there is a girl in it but never mind, just imagine a movie based on semi-entertaining drifts and soppy story lines and somewhat cheesy characters.This is not a bad film. It's just that I expected them to raise the bar. The soundtrack is decent and the music will make you tap your feet while you sit in the theater.Overall, I'd say the film is watchable if you do not expect very good actions. The villain could have been made to look cooler than what they did make him look like. The Japanese should love this film. Not the best camera-work in the film though. The sets are below average for an action packed film of this genre.Anyhow, watch it if you must. I would watch it if I read my own review for it's worth watching. That's all.",benighted2005,2006-06-19,2006
7.0,Like finding a pristine Z in the garage with a seized engine...,"First, I am a car guy. So at least one of those stars is simply from the fact that it's a car movie with good vehicle exposure. That being said, I went into it thinking I'd see a weak attempt at milking the franchise, and was pleasantly surprised to find a plot, character, and development. FF3 has it's warts, but it ain't half bad and I'd recommend it to anyone into the car scene. Now for those warts. First and foremost, the car racing scenes are gratuitous and CGI'd: it's a movie though, people, so get over it. They look cool, even if in some cases, whomever was responsible should be taken out and flogged. The laws of physics *can* be obeyed and still permit the production of a good racing scene. Acting was excellent, which has always impressed me in this franchise where I expect something more along the line of Mischief 3000. So kudos to casting and directing. The plot in this (no spoilers!) is weaker than a head gasket on a 1960 'vette been in a barn rotting for 30+ years. And what makes it worse is it didn't have to be. Hire me, boys, I can fix your flaws! But still not so weak I couldn't watch it. I am not appreciative of the plot vehicles they are using to draw these people together, though. You do not have to bring the movie down by utilizing undersirable character flaws. Seriously, call me, I'll walk you through how to make a better movie without the weak plot. The hunnies are nice, but barely adequate to anyone who's attended a good car show. They need more camera time. The lead actress Nathalie Kelley is fiiiiiiiine. But she got enough time. The cars were the real loss on this one. No time was spent in even cursory discussion about what chassis, what engine, what tweaks. That's why we come, boys, to see the cars. There are some really nice cars, just not a lot of time spent on them. I couldn't even identify a couple they were so modded, and that's a shame. Going to have to buy the DVD with the extras disc to find out more, I suppose. All in all, more fuel for gear heads. And Tokyo looks great; I can't wait to get a look at those hills up close and personal.",icbkr,2006-06-19,2006
10.0,Much better than 2fast,This movie was far better than 2fast 2furious. Thankfully the ditched the tired storyline of an undercover cop in this one. This time around it's about a kid that just wants to race. The plot isn't amazing but at least its fresh and not the same tired movie with new race scenes.(2fast 2furious). The movie gets off to a banging start with a race with in the first five minutes. The racing scenes in this one are the best of the series. I thought the characters in this movie were great too. While not as gritty and mean as the characters from the previous movies they do stand out well. I especially liked bow wows character. So basically if you liked the first movie or even the second then you should love this one. I don't know why some people are giving it bad reviews and scores. But If you like fast cars then this is definitely a movie for you.,bobeatsrice,2006-06-19,2006
6.0,Better than the previous,"Enter the life of Shawn Boswell, a college student with a manic taste for car racing. After numerous counts of traffic offenses, his mother decides to shift him to Tokyo as a last resort to live in with his divorced dad after the last count of traffic offense could see him in jail if he was tried as an adult. However things in Tokyo didn't really change much in terms of illegal racing for Shawn except where racing is done in drifting style. Somewhat curious and somewhat enthusiastic with this new genre of racing, Shawn takes on the challenge of becoming the next Drifting King.Walking into this movie, I had not much anticipation of a great film, since it was apparent to me that even Paul Walker did not sign to this film and Lucas Black, who plays the lead role wasn't actually a familiar name in Hollywood. My hunch was about right, the film did not provide the kind of intensity I'd love to see in a racing film. However the movie itself isn't that bad on given the Hollywood special effects added to it. The real letdown of this film to me was for most part of the racing, which was done in drifting style, the cinematography captured the facial expression of the actors instead of highlighting the race which is deemed necessary if you want to exhilarate the audience. Very unlike in the first installment where we were treated with the cars being driven at dangerous speeds. But all wasn't that bad, since the movie did have it's funny moments and thrilling scenes. I especially enjoyed the first few minutes of the film before the hero was moved to Tokyo and also where Vin Diesel makes a cameo appearance at the ending.Overall the film was a lot better than the second installment which i believe was the worst in the franchise. Also a note to film goers who prefer drama based genre, really not the kind of movie u'd like to watch, since the plot was paper thin and kind of ludicrous if you really think about it.",HypercriticalHangdog,2006-06-20,2006
10.0,Best Fast and Furious movie,This movie trumps over the other 2 no problem. There is more excitement and more racing. More action packed and none of the sexuality or strong language content which is really great if you have a young one watching it with you. The cars are great I'm not really into cars but this movie I think changed that. I went and seen it last weekend at the Drive In and I am going to go see it again this weekend. That is how great it is. Lucas Black is awesome in it. He really has grown up since The War and Sling Blade. HHHHHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!! I give it 20 thumbs up. I promise you will not be disappointed. Well I guess that is all I can really say about you will just have to go watch it for yourself and decide what you think about it.,dachshundsr1,2006-06-20,2006
5.0,The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is far better than I expected - but I had low expectations. Enjoyable but not critically appealing,"I was quite surprised by The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift. Of course, I expected it to be a pile of steaming garbage, particularly with the formula of increasingly dodgy sequels. So when I went to see it with some friends, I had obvious misgivings. These misgivings, or at least the worst ones, such as the movie being unbearable to even look at, were fortunately unfounded. I kept my eyes on the movie the whole time, mainly because of the souped cars, but the fact that I went through the movie without flinching (a lot, except at some of the bad dialogue that was prevalent), says quite a lot. Maybe my view of The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift is heightened by the fact that I cracked a few jokes during the movie.Now down to business. Sean, a 'dude' who loves to race at high speeds for no apparent reason, is sent to Tokyo to live with his military dad and ends up being drawn to the racing circuit again, witnessing a new style of race called 'drift' (as seen in Need For Speed Underground, to those that don't know). Sounds stupid? Well, it is, the casual viewer can detect a plothole or two from even reading those two lines. To go on, except to state that Sean ends up making friends with a guy named Han, is pointless. I will admit that no-one looks for a good plot in a Fast and the Furious movie, but still, the less said, the better.The dialogue, as I stated, can be funny - because of its stupidity. This is shown by one piece of dialogue where some guy asks Sean: ""You know what DK stands for?"" and Sean replies ""Donkey Kong"". At least its original, I guess.The acting is OK - far from turgid, which I expected it to be in the first place. The guy who plays Han is surprisingly good, going through the movie without looking as if he was hired from a nearby sushi bar. Brian Tee as DK is a bit of a joke, he is more comedic than menacing. Lucas Black is OK as Sean, but his Southern accent makes his character more irritating to watch. The love interest does well as eye candy. That's about all that matters I guess.The most important part of The Fast and the Furious is inarguably the racing sequences and their overall effectiveness. I will admit that the sequences themselves are well-filmed and eye catching, highlighting the cars, as they should. However, except in a few fleeting moments, they are not as enthralling as they should be and this is one of the most disappointing aspects of The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift. The final confrontation, for me, is pretty good to watch, but only arouses the senses once in a while.Time didn't drag though, which is a clear sign that The Fast and Furious is indeed quite watchable, despite its other pre-eminent faults. I admit that I didn't really get bored during the film, which may lead to my rose-tinted view of it (compared to my original perception of what it would be like).So let me summarise my thoughts: ""Didn't expect much, got more than I bargained for."" The acting is satisfactory (for a racing film, otherwise it would more or less suck), the plot and the dialogue are predictably terrible, the racing sequences are satisfactory and the cinematography is somewhat effective, with frequent close-ups of the cars. What compels me to give The Fast and The Furious a pass grade is the fact that it is, like I said, quite watchable. However, it is still little more than satisfactory, so it's rating cannot therefore rise above:2.5/5 stars",DaRick89,2006-06-20,2006
10.0,"Opening Boring, But Rest Awesome","I saw this movie in theaters recently and I highly recommend it. Though the opening makes the movie seem cheesy and boring (it doesn't open with a race as usual, but instead with high school kids walking through a metal detector), after the beginning, it is awesome. I would recommend watching it in a theater with friends, and maybe even buying it when it comes out on DVD. It is definitely worth the money, delivering the same levels of excitement as the first two movies. All the actors are new to this series, but they are excellent actors (and pretty darn cute!). Japanese culture is presented very well, with the girls wearing the latest trends, using the latest Japanese music, and even accurately representing small things, such as school dress codes. The surprise cameo at the end (not telling who!) makes the movie all he more interesting and leaves you wanting to see more.",peacebe_dajourney,2006-06-20,2006
1.0,May have spoilers but who cares this movie blows.,"Coming into the theater I had no hope for this movie. The first 2 were horrible and I was dragged to see this one. There are two ways to portray this movie, 1: as a joke, or 2: ""awesome"". People who do not understand what makes a ""good"" movie will love this film. First off, acting yes, was horrible from the beginning and especially to the end. Second problem, the ""culture"" of the Japanese. Nobody in Japan cares about drifting, except for those fisherman of course, and not every teenage girl is a skank in a short skirt looking for ""awesome"" drifters. The plot was ridiculous, completely predictable. Hmm, love story with an outsider, dad gets involved with drifting, and o yeah someone dies. When Lucas Black's Japanese friend crashes his car, why did the car blow up? Was he carrying C-4 with him? The drifting scenes looked like they came right out of Need For Speed Underground, but without the point total on top. If you see this movie, at least get someone else to pay for you or just do not go at all. For the people that liked/loved this movie, they need to watch what a real movie is such as Fight Club, Reservoir Dogs, V for Vendetta, or Pulp Fiction.",Lgmsbroncs07,2006-06-20,2006
1.0,Utterly worthless waste of time and money,"TFATF is THE most pointless and artistically redundant franchise in history! The first, which was a total piece of crap, gave way to a tepid, moronic sequel and now, after three years of peace and quiet we are punished with Tokyo Drift. The most American Japan you will ever see in a film! Although there is even less of a story than the other two (if that's possible) it is still a carbon copy of its predecessors and offers absolutely nothing new. The characters are crap! The action is lame, soulless, overcut and PG13-friendly and is obviously 'inspired' by hours and hours of endless Playstation.The only reason I went to see this turkey is because I LOVE Japanese girls. But, like I said, this is the most American Japan you will ever see, so there is hardly any of them at all. And all Japanese girls are shot from behind so you can't actually see that they're Japanese. Whether or not this is because they are just LA girls masquerading as Japanese Girls or it's because Universal didn't want to alienate American audiences I don't know. But if you're expecting anything remotely resembling a culture clash then ditch that preconception. I guess that kind of thing would be too difficult for the writers of this trash to muster. And how the hell does hillbilly main character Sean Boswell master the Japanese language in a few days? It's no secret that TFATF films operate on a declining scale. And, forgive me for sounding like a fuddy-duddy, I feel that they send the wrong message to the wrong generation.Speed gets you babes. Speed gets you babes. Speed gets you babes. Speed gets you babes. Speed gets you babes. Speed gets you babes. Speed gets you babes. Speed gets you babes.The film is even less subtle than the above paragraph. Despite the disclaimer at the end, warning naive audience members of the dangers of such driving (such people cannot read anyway and left as soon as the screen went black) I must point out that too many impressionable kids forget this is just a stupid fantasy movie. A dumb disclaimer at the end isn't enough to dissuade them from trying all the crap that is featured in this movie.But that is to be expected from lowest-possible-common-denominator garbage.",CuriosityKilledShawn,2006-06-20,2006
9.0,Definite Improvement Over the First Two Films,"Being an automotive enthusiast, (and a movie buff) for over 10 years now, I've always been one of the first in line to see the F and F movies when they came out. This movie was no exception. However, after being disappointed with the first two films, I didn't expect much from this third installment. The first two films satisfied my need for hot cars, women, and so-so action scenes, but I felt that the acting, dialog, and story lines were very thin and boring. F and F Tokyo Drift was much better than I had anticipated. It seems that the director (Justin Lin) actually concentrated more on the acting skill of the actors and dramatic aspects of the film, than he did on showing off the cars. That's where the first two installments fell short. It was also great to see the drift culture in this film, in addition to the show and drag-race culture that we were exposed to in the first two films. I've never been to Japan, but from what I have experienced in the U.S., I felt that the film did a pretty good job of depicting the key elements of the drift culture to the audience. Of course there were a few of the usual over-the-top stunts and scenes, but it's to be expected in a Hollywood picture. If it were exactly true to life, it would just be a documentary. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised and entertained, and I think that if you even somewhat enjoyed the first two, you will definitely love F and F Tokyo Drift. Even if you're not into cars and/or the whole tuner culture, the movie is still entertaining and a fun ride.",dchampagne-2,2006-06-20,2006
10.0,Maybe Best One So Far!,"This movie is SO good. All the actors, even though most not being actually Japanese really played their parts well. The cars were really cool. There was humor in the movie which is always good. The movie also has depth. And the new actress playing Neela is SO pretty.Apart from maybe one or two scenes where the depiction of underground Japanese society seems inaccurate (I wouldn't know, just seemed more like American society), I really really liked the movie!! My boyfriend even said that it may even be better than the first two.I recommend this movie to seriously anyone who likes cars, who likes seeing pretty chicks, who gets adrenaline rush from racing and whoever just wants to watch a seriously awesome movie. =P",k4j_4eva,2006-06-20,2006
7.0,Fast Furious Tokyo Drift,"Let me start out by saying ""why god why did you let the second movie in this series happen"". Paul ""douchebag"" Walker's acting in both of the first two movies was on par with the acting skills of a retarded kitten on mescaline. The first movie was made by Vin Diesel alone. The second movie was dead in the water when Vin Deisel left, killed by Paul Walker, but Tyrese and Ludicrous were the nails in the coffin. Needless to say, I formed a discrimination against musicians in movies. (Mos Def in anything*) But in Tokyo Drift, Lil Bow-Wow was surprisingly good in his role as Twinkie, although several gay jokes always followed his name being said. I'm glad to say that, although Lucas Black left something to be desired, like more emotion, his southern drawl is fitting for the farm boy classic American aspect of the main character. There are a HELL of a lot of Japanese people in this movie. NOT racist, just sayin. After all, it IS Japan... If you've never seen drifting and you like cars go see this movie. When this movie comes out on DVD I will be buying it and adding it to my collection. Many people may disagree with me because of a thin plot, etc but this movie strikes a place in my heart that loves drifting. And calling Lil Bow Wow twink. The Fast and the Furious; Tokyo Drift gets: 6/10 for creativity. 3/10 for romance. 9/10 for racing sequences. 10/10 for having a 25 year old play a high schooler(Zachary Ty Bryan).total 7/10 * Coincidentally mos def does a song on the soundtrack. I recommend bringing earplugs.",koffeekan,2006-06-20,2006
10.0,It was H O T,"The movie was great. Although I do think that it was kind of loosely based on a bad attitude Initial D movie. But all in all it was definitely the best Fast and The Furious movie compared to it's predecessors. If Paramount is willing to make another one, they should definitely aim for something like this one. I was kind of getting sick and tired of the same Nitros powered vehicles / rims bigger than the door of their cars, and it's drivers wanting to just go straight and think that's the best. As humans (and street hood rat racers) we all know that ""in life"" it has it's path of ups and downs and lefts and rights, sharp curves, and hairpins or what not.

3.0,Is Vin Diesel the best part of this flick?,"No ... but his appearance is more disconcerting than seeing Donald Rumsfeld on Jon Stewart. It's a blatant teaser for the next F+F-Formula production, and his career side bet in case ‘Hannibal 2006’ doesn't pay off at the box office. The movie: absolute formula. ‘Characters dumb as a bag of rocks.’ Awful acting, ropey plot to kill time while waiting for the next hot cars and/or race-queen sequence. You might have 5 minutes of actual ‘drift racing’, but it's edited in that hyperkinetic MTV style so you won't really see anything... much less learn how to pay for $600+ sets of tires which last for mere minutes of use. The car action and incidental women are fine, but that shouldn't be enough for your movie ticket. You don't realize quite how far you've fallen until the sudden appearance of Diesel tells you it's time to leave the theatre air-conditioning; the movie's over and the ride was on *YOU*.",jginnane,2006-06-21,2006
5.0,"An average addition to the ""Fast and the furious"" franchise.","Not being a particularly ardent car-lover or fan of street racing at all, I didn't go into this movie with high hopes. Nevertheless, even for non-revheads like me there are enough enjoyable elements in this film to keep you from walking out. Some exhilarating car races, notable moments of humour and of course a veritable parade of attractive and underdressed women kept me entertained. The illogical storyline and numerous plot holes began to get annoying by the end; if the movie wasn't so long then this wouldn't have been as noticeable. Also, the Vin Diesel cameo was rather poorly played. Besides these admittedly minor gripes, there is a lot of fun to be had here - flashy cars, hot girls and a surprisingly competent Lil' Bow Wow in an amusing side-role.",reti_incarnate,2006-06-21,2006
3.0,This movie was awful,"How do the movie makers convince the money men to send them to a place like Tokoyo and totally destroy a tried and true action series like F&F with big $$. The hero, can't get out of his way in a US public school, is supposed to be casted as white trailer trash, but then speaks fluent Japanese and attends a private school, for what army brats, and has no issues??. Magically, has absolutely no problem with driving on the wrong side of the road(just turned 18), and is allowed to destroy what $80,000 in autos belonging to a guy he just met? Pluease, The damsel in distress has the sex appeal of a small rock ( and I love pretty girls in school uniforms) and we are supposed to believe that she would ever deal with a local thug(s) who make their money how exactly (everyone is drinking soda). This should have been a R rating with tremendously sexy Japanese Girls and ADULTS making all the bad decisions. What did we learn? That it is OK to destroy hundreds of thousands of newly constructed homes in the USA, thousands of dollars worth of cars, with absolutely NO ramifications?. Oh yeah, and that you have to do fish tails around young Japaneses girls in their own hot cars to Just get their phone Number. TOO shallow, Too Unbelievable, and TOO typical a climax to the Movie. Daddy bails out misfit son, by just happening to have a old hot rod frame. I left as soon as Dad's garage opened up.",pfdoiron,2006-06-21,2006
8.0,Surprised,"I wandered into the theater to see Tokyo Drift as a time killer. Being a lover of all things Asian, I wasn't expecting much, but to my surprise, I really enjoyed the film. I had seen the original Fast and the Furious and found it passable entertainment and really didn't expect much from a second sequel, but this film really has heart, perhaps due to the many female production people listed in the credits.Lucas Black is Sean Boswell,a teen-aged racing fanatic who finds himself banished to the care of his father in Tokyo, Japan when his luck runs out with the law at home. Trying to fit into an alien culture, Sean finds himself falling into the illegal racing culture. A bad race lands him in servitude to a top racer who becomes a mentor. With a new girlfriend things are going well for Sean except that Han, his mentor is partners with a low level Yakuza underling who holds sway over his girlfriend Neela. Betrayal leads to murder and revenge culminating in a final nighttime race down a mountainside.While not a great script, the story held my attention throughout. Indeed, some of the Japanese school scenes suggest interesting possibilities for an entirely separate film. This is not a film about acting, but Lucas Black holds his own against the lovingly photographed cars. The other local performers all did well and as usual the Asian with blond hair is always a bad guy and why couldn't a Japanese actress be found to play the love interest?",Mark-129,2006-06-21,2006
8.0,Stylish and exciting,"I was pleasantly surprised when i saw ""fast and the furious"" today. After a lackluster effort in the second movie, a new energy was injected into the series with ""Tokyo Drift"" I found that in ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" the people involved in creating the movie were scared of smashing up the cars too much. In races people would not bump into other cars, but would rather sit behind them trying to be menacing. The action also seemed to occur off the racecourse, instead of on, which is more characteristic of car movies.But enough of ""2 Fast 2 Furious"". On to ""Tokyo Drift"". This movie has just nothing to the previous movies in the series apart from racing and a cameo at the end of the movie. Many people will know that no characters from the last movie have been carried over into ""Tokyo Drift"". Instead of having a cop, the new main character is from the other side of the tracks and very early in the film it is established that he has a history of reckless driving.Don't expect too much from the storyline, it's very linear. There aren't any real big shocks. But this simplicity isn't important. What hooks you in is the style it is done with. The races are all exciting, even when you know who will win - as is the case with a race early in the film. Of course, as this film is all about drifting, there is an added danger. Car damage is dealt out constantly. There isn't many car scenes where all the cars come out clean. This is where ""Tokyo Drift"" excels - dirty and uncompromising racing. Whenever there is the chance cars clash, either to spin out the opponent, or knock them into a wall or even off a cliff.I recommend that people take a couple hours out of their day to sit back, relax and enjoy ""Tokyo Drift""",this_is_gibbo,2006-06-21,2006
6.0,It's about time..,"When I first watched The Fast and The Furious in 2001. I thought a sequel to it would surely screw up. Sure enough, 2F2F came out, and I was right. I first thought, a third movie would completely ruin the franchise..Oh how wrong I am. This movie is jam packed with action from start to finish, and has little comedic moments thrown in. I was on the edge of my seat, and was shaking. At the last race, and at the end, my heart was beating like crazy. Tokyo Drift is the only TFTF movie that actually captured the import scene correctly. The first two were too Hollywood. This one has a new face, Sean Boswell(Played by Lucas Black), and he doesn't disappoint. When hes caught for destroying property, and street racing, he is sent to Tokyo, Japan to live with his father, who was in the military. He meets Twinkie(Played by Bow Wow) who links him into the world of underground racing, where a new form of racing called drifting (think of it as, turning..with style). Overall. I give The Fast and The Furious:Tokyo Drift a total of 10 out of 10. It made my heart beat, pulled me to the edge of my seat, and never bored me. Justin Lin is a king.",Raj9096,2006-06-21,2006
5.0,Ehhhh,This movie was not good not bad it was kinda boring watching it because it was the same thing over and over not much to say not worth the admission. If i was you i would tell your buddies unless they are hardcore car freaks or Fast and the Furious fans to just wait for this flop to hit DVD. The plot of the movie just was horrific if you ask me i mean this kid how old is he supposed to be in the first place? 27 34 18? I could not tell i mean he did not look like he belonged in a high school to me. The moves some of the guys pulled in these cars were so unreal that it made me want to puke i ask this with a lot of movies though have they heard of gravity?,skcussihtedud-1,2006-06-21,2006
7.0,High-octane direction makes it entertaining,"Shawn is a young delinquent with a habit of getting in trouble due to his driving habits. His latest offense has him going to Tokyo to avoid jail time. It isn't long before he meets up with the car culture there and gets an embarrassing taste of drift racing by losing to a local champ who also has connections with the Yakuza. Soon Shawn is drawn into the underground world and a predictable, but stylish summer-fare ensues.The story here is one you've either seen before or will comfortably predict. Also, when going to see a second sequel to a franchise that is all about cars, what can you really expect? Nothing too spectacular on either story or action side of the film, but this is a surprising strong entry to a series, seeing that it is number 3 of course.The acting is decent with the clichés not being to overplayed or outrunning themselves, but rather just acting as connective tissue for the film's main event - the breakneck racing scenes. Which is exactly what the first film didn't quite reach and what the horrible second film in this franchise seriously lacked. The racing scenes here are possibly the best in the F&F franchise with a high octane direction that makes them very exciting to watch. They incorporate a lot of interesting shots - both CGI and real-life - mix it in with slow motion and all sorts of pans, which is then topped of with some frenetic editing and a hard rockin' soundtrack. That makes for some good fast- paced summer fun. 7/10Rated PG-13: violence, frenetic action, and some profanity",BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,2006-06-21,2006
4.0,movie in two words- Tokyo and drift,"This movie was brutally average, and it seemed that the film makers wanted to accomplish two things. First was to make a movie in Japan. The other was to make a movie with expensive cars doing maneuvers not filmed before. The result of which was a movie mad with excellent visuals and fast paced action and the story was badly hurt by it. So much emphasis on making a cool looking movie that every one seemed to forget about the story. And there was good potential for a phenomenal story but any where they could have made the story shine they failed. Characters that were important to the main character were left under developed. You cant blame the screenwriter, but I haven't seen the script so maybe you can. And important plot points were nulled over and passed off just to get to the racing. But all in all the movie wasn't terrible or a complete loss, everything that made the movie bad can easily be corrected with another sequel. Which I am sure that Hollywood wouldn't have a problem with, it means more money for them.",garysbass,2006-06-22,2006
9.0,Lived up to the purpose of its inception and then some.,"In a 2-day time span, I saw this movie and The Break-up, and I'm glad this one the vote for the one we saw first, even though I voted against it. I had lost faith in the series after 2 fast 2 furious, and was surprised that this one didn't take on the moniker 3 3rast 3 3rurious. The change of protagonist was a nice change, though the acting for his part could have been done better, and while the accent didn't get to me much, I found it rather amusing that most of the Asian actors had better enunciation than this one of the handful of Americans in the film. I went into this film expecting action, and action I received. From the first thrilling race against Zachery Ty Bryan in his daddy's Viper, to the final showdown against the very hate-able antagonist, and everything in between. I, like others, saw the first race, and thought ‘Okay, they can't POSSIBLY get any better than that!’ and was proved wrong as the protagonist comically smashed up a lent car. Speaking of smashed up cars, this had to be some of the best driving stunt work I've seen in a great long while. While a lot of the work was obviously CG, it was integrated so well that I barely noticed, and I'm working towards a B.A in Animation, so I have a better trained eye than most in noticing that sort of thing. My only major gripe was the midnight drift with the girl. It was extraneous, and, in my opinion, could have been cut. There are better ways for character development. I got something I didn't expect out of this movie as well. This elusive thing to most action flicks that we like to call ‘Plot’. While some of it was strained, I think that, considering the genre, they managed to put together a great plot. The idea was that the protagonist was an outcast automotive engineering student, who never fit in, except for racing. In his new So.Cal. Public School, complete with metal detectors, he gets into a squabble with the local football star, Zachary Ty Bryan over what all teenage boys fight over, a girl. Predictably, a race is chosen to decide this. After much destruction of property, he wins the race, but loses as his car flips, in what I think is one of the best uses of slow-mo since The Matrix. Afterwards, at the police precinct, he is in big trouble, and his mother bails him out in *ahem* unknown ways. His mother, presumably tired of moving every time her son gets into trouble (it's never said, but I believe it's a reasonable assumption), he is sent to Tokyo to live with his estranged Navy father. It is there that he gets involved in the underground world of Drifting, and proceeds to wreck up cars and get babes, and everything else. He manages to get into another fight about another girl, but this time with a guy who's Yakuza (Japanese mob for those less educated or who haven't seen this movie), or at least has Yakuza ties, and thus is more dangerous to mess with. This guy, known only as DK, becomes the source for much strife (obviously, as he's the main antagonist), eventually leading to the final race, involving my favorite car ever. I'm trying my best to leave out big spoilers here, so I won't give away the very end of it. All in all, this movie was an excellent film to see with friends. The adrenaline rush was so great through the movie, and the cars, as a side note, weren't the outrageous things from the first two. No neon under glow, and spoilers half the size of the car (maybe these tuner kids will stop blocking my view with them now), and the cars with spoilers actually needed spoilers (Honda Civics with spoilers always make me laugh). One thing to remember, though, is that it is an action movie, after all is said and done. It wasn't really created to portray a message, or do anything other than entertain. If you look too deep at this movie, you will be invariably disappointed. There's not much beyond face value to the movie, but it will be enjoyable if you take it as such.",terulian_maveric,2006-06-22,2006
6.0,The Cars do the talking.,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift Directed by Justin Lin Starring: Mitsubishi Evo 9, Nissan Silva, Ford Mustang, RX 7, Toyota Chaser, Lucas Black, Bow Wow, Nathalie Kelly, Sung Kang, Sonny ChibaI think the Mitsubishi should get a best actor nomination for next year's Oscars.Nice cars. Nice music. Nice bodies. Nice cityscape.Brainless story. But that's what I watched it for, to have my brains parked outside the cinema and let the brainlessness drive me through a two hour entertainment.The RX7 has more expression than all the actors.C - Because it served its purpose in entertaining me with awesome drifts, over-sized exhaust pipes, and kick butt photography for a car racing film.",superratty-tmy,2006-06-22,2006
1.0,very disappointed,"after i saw this movie tonight, i was very disappointed. frist of all mistakes, pick some koreans to play Japanese-locals roles, i mean come on...this is a Japanese based film, you can do better than that. second, those hot girls look like they're Japanese blended Americans/mild Japanese styled LA girls. third, this movie's camera movements and film editing really makes the previous two better. it has too much camera vibration and rich segmanted sequence may make it look fast, but it also makes you feel dizzy for 1 min of action secquence . fourth, the story is crap, no point at all. if you wanna see LA girls again, wait till its DVD comes out so you can rewind it couple of times, otherwise, no need to waste your money in the theatre for this movie.",blacklude,2006-06-22,2006
1.0,"Somebody please, take my wife.","What a disappointment. Lin gets noticed by making one of the best films on teenage disillusionment I've seen in recent times and then he has to go and make two complete stinkers. I didn't think that he could possibly stoop any lower than Annapolis, but I was proved wrong. Tokyo Drift could possibly be the worst idea for a film that I've ever seen. Believe me, I'm not so naive as to think every film that gets made needs to be an award winner. There's a place for Blockbuster, tent-pole fare. But who in God's name wants to see another freaking F&F? Honestly? If you go and see this film and enjoy it. Please do us all a favor and pour nitric acid on your eyeballs. You might then be forgiven for actually giving this film props, because hey, who's gonna tell a blind guy off for liking a bad movie? Not I.Rodger Ebert, I'm so disappointed in you.

6.0,Movie Review & Cultural Commentary,"So, I went to see The Fast & the Furious: Tokyo Drift on Monday night with my girl friends, partially cause I really wanted to see it and partially because it was a great escape from the sweltering heat. I'm not a huge fan of pimped out cars, but I am a fan of Justin Lin (Better Luck Tomorrow is AMAZING, and everyone should see it) and hot leading men. Although the movie isn't Casablanca or anything the Oscars committee needs to keep its eye on, for what it is, Justin Lin does a great job with the silly plot and worn-down franchise. The cinematography of the movie is something to be reckoned with. Lin takes advantage of his Tokyo location and incorporates it quite nicely into the film. During one of the race scenes, Lin purposefully takes the chase to a stand still as the car takes a sharp corner, and while the contrast between the bright, flickering Tokyo lights against the paused car creates an aesthetically pleasing and memorable image, it also reminds the audience of the stark differences between street racing in Japan versus in the United States. As depicted early on in the film, street racing in the States merely attests to the speed and power of a car, and in a land where Roosevelt reminded us to talk softly and carry a big stick, how is it surprising that Americans constantly feel the need to prove the existence of its balls, from the government's decision to invade Iraq all the way down to the debased form of street racing? However, Japanese culture feverishly pulses with both life, beauty, and, most importantly, control. It thrives on diversity, and its contradictions only enrichen it. Japan is a country where the mountains still resonate with the lives of vegetable farmers and long-gone Samurais, but, at the same time, it is also a country where the yen takes off at rocket speed and sets the ever-soaring standard in technology and fashion (Harajuku, yes?). Therefore, it's not surprisingly that even something as uncharacteristically uncouth as street racing also embodies the unusual amalgam of speed and control in the form of drifting- and Lin is very well aware of this. His mix of testosterone-heavy chase sequences intermingled with its decelerated moments celebrates both Lin's love for the fast pace Tokyo lifestyle and the country's eastern spiritual roots. Moreover, Lin's beautiful, soft camera work depicts the care and subtleness that drifting embraces as opposed to American racing where it's all gas and all adrenaline without the gentleness. And for a director to convey this cultural gap, in a moment in the midst of raw action no less, is a stroke of talent. And while the main lead oozes Southern charm with his crooked smile and drawl, the Asian male leads hold their own in comparison, especially Sung Kang, who also starred in Lin's shattering Better Luck Tomorrow debut. Among all the Asians in the film, Kang is the only one (that I know of at least) that speaks English fluently and as a first language. In casting Kang, Lin introduces a character that many Asian Americans can relate to, unlike the sushi chefs and calculus nerds that Asians most frequently portray. Kang plays the character Han, a mobster that sympathizes with army brat, Sean Boswell, as he tries to break into the homogeneous Japanese underground street-racing world. Han is foremost an American, and only then does he identify with his Asian heritage. Because of his own American status, Kang's character is able to understand and befriend Boswell, but, simultaneously, his Asian features open a door into the exclusive Japanese culture. Furthermore, while Asian characters in the media tend to be the villain or the wimp, Han is neither. Yes, Han engages in illegal activity, like the typical, one-dimensional bad guy, but his character endears the audience with his low-key dialogue and half-smile. At moments, Han appears almost reluctant to embed himself in further shady dealings, as when he explains to Boswell that he has enough money and not enough loyal friends, but at other moments, he soaks in the lifestyle of Cristal and fast cars. Kang's convincingly complex Han is enough that even if one isn't a competitive street racer and mafioso (as many are not, I hope), a casual movie go-er will relate to the character's duality, whether Asian or not. Or maybe I'm just reading too far into a boy movie.",nagolberry,2006-06-22,2006
10.0,Oh Yea!!!,"The Fast and The Furious:Tokyo Drift was by far the best Fast and the Furious installment made. It is packed with exciting race scenes and a good story. Although I found some parts to be a little corny, it had no effect on my overall enjoyment while watching this movie, and i never felt bored at any point in the movie. The action was accompanied by a great selection of music which added to the ""feel"" of the movie. If you have not seen this movie yet, I suggest going out and watching it ASAP. You can't go wrong with loud cars, lots of women, and good music. If you enjoyed the last couple parts of the series, I'm sure this one won't let you down. And if you do watch and don't like it, I think you might be crazy!!!",sethcooper06,2006-06-23,2006
9.0,Watch this movie!,"There's only one part of this movie I disagree with, but I don't want to spoil it at all, so you'll have to email me or something if you really want to know about that (phoenix_darkhawk@yahoo.com). Tight rides and tighter tracks, Very few sequels stand up to the original, but this one was probably the best of the trilogy. There was less focus on the appearance of the vehicles than the first two, more on the story, and better racing. The guest star at the very end is a nice touch too, for those who have liked the whole series. The acting is overall good, even though I rather disliked the heavy southern accent of the main character, he just sounded too much like a hick (and I'm from Oklahoma!). Seriously though, if you like good races, fast cars, and a good story, this is a must see movie.",phoenix_darkhawk,2006-06-23,2006
3.0,Slightly Entertaining Movie with bad actors and worst story,"This movie starts as expected and pretty entertaining, involving some street racing, and some 17yo who obviously doesn't fit in 'Sport America' and the whole high-school thing. I gotta say, from the first time I saw the main actor, and he going through the metal detectors, I tried to imagine he was going to an airport, then a university, even with cheerleaders, football teams and all the cliché that comes with movies presenting high schools, I thought that, because they casted a 23yo guy that looks like a 32yo, I'm still actually having trouble believing that the actor is only 23 years old. Sean 17 years old, played by Lucas Black, age 23, but looks 32, is the average American, with a slightly heavy, bad and annoying southern accent with a cowboy style goes to Tokyo after a race ends badly, there he meets with another bunch of 17yo who also look like in their late 20's, early 30's, and all have money, cars and lots of girls, including the main one, Neela, played by Nathalie Kelley, who obviously, gets disputed by both Sean, and his comic-book 'arch-villain' D.K.. The problem with the cast was with the choice for Sean and Neela, the first for being a bad actor and all of the reasons listed above, the latter because I think they injected her with so much botox, that except her mouth moving and eyes blinking and shedding some fake tears, you don't see any kind of facial expression whatsoever, the rest of the cast was good, even the Japanese playing the badly made character, D.K.. The story gets ridiculous from the minute Sean arrives in Tokyo, after school, he meets his demographically chosen friend and goes see the 'underground world of car racing', there he sees Neela again and from the start gets entangled in a love triangle involving the yakuza bad boy D.K., so, Sean challenges him for a race, oh wait, he doesn't have a car, no problem, some guy who never saw Sean before, or even knows his name, lends his 100k car, well, Sean trashes the car during the race, and that way, hey he made a new powerful friend, Han the Zen, all he did was trash his car. Anyway, some scenes of Sean learning how to drift happen, over and over and over and over and over again, some flirting with Neela, anyway, he end up winning a race from one of D.K.'s drivers, after that some news happen, Han is stealing from D.K., so some fighting ensues, Hans gets f-cked and then Sean decides to go talk with the Yakuza master of the region, D.K.'s uncle, he gives the uncle some money and propose some peaceful solution, a race between D.K. and Sean, nevermind that the fight was already over, Hans was dead and Sean had nothing to offer, or was any kind of threat to anyone, but hey, this is a sequel, so, 3 Fast and 3 Furious, some racing ensues with a predictable ending. One thing that was very enjoyable in this movie, was the street racing, those scenes were made in such a professional way, that one can only wish that the rest of the crew had the same competence, also those scenes remembered me a lot of Need for Speed, specially in the initial sequence, when some shortcut is taken, doesn't really try to distant itself when it puts some of the same soundtrack, which is also the only other positive point of the movie, of course, the producers had to ruin that also, the final street racing is by far the poorest, with all the curves looking the same, in the mountains, and some cellphones videos for some street racing fans. Any, this was a very bad movie, with a terrible story and even worst main cast, but with some decent supporting cast, good soundtrack and excellent street racing scenes, but I still don't recommend.",kok_warlock,2006-06-23,2006
8.0,Great entertainment! A great step up for the series.,"This movie RULES.I honestly don't understand the people who hated it. Yes, there is a good deal of very poor acting. Yes, the story is pretty stupid. Yes, everything about this movie is contrived... but honestly, are any of these surprising? Did we not expect this? The fact is, this movie stands head and shoulders above 2 Fast, 2 Furious. I do not believe that is an opinion. The acting is better, the story is better, the characters are more believable, the production value is FAR better... none of these are stellar by any means, but what you end up with is solid entertainment. As long as you know what you're looking at, you will laugh, whether they meant you to or not.I'm not sure if I enjoyed it more than the first F&F, but it's definitely a fun movie. Don't go looking for something believable, and don't expect a deep, involving story -- just go to be entertained, and I can almost guarantee you'll at least get a good laugh.There are definitely negatives, though. The acting is not good. Not awful, but not good. The female lead looks like Michael Jackson. I mean dog ugly. The plot is very simple, and not exactly involving.The positives, obviously, are the details. The races are certainly fun to watch; a LOT of the really stupid things (like, well, all the dialogue) can be really entertaining as long as you're not taking them seriously. There's a lot of idiocy that car people will catch and laugh at -- my knowledge of auto mechanics is mediocre, but I still got some great laughs out of this film. E-brake drifting in RWD cars... if you get it, you'll enjoy it.Overall... watch this movie to be entertained. I'm not disappointed; I'm glad I saw it on the big screen, and once it's out on DVD, I will definitely be obtaining a copy.7.5/10",etzool,2006-06-23,2006

The first one was great it had a great plot and story line, the second funny and good, and this one was pretty good as well.Hopefully when they make a 4th one they wont go down.

3.0,Horrible plot and dialogue,"I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this movie had a rating 3.9, but I saw it last night and I say it was well deserved. It quite possibly has the dumbest plot I've ever seen, I think a grade 6 could have come up with a better plot. The plot is so basic, the main character experiences a whole new concept to racing, he sucks at it and then finds a mentor who *gasps* is not as good as the antagonist, but still pretty good, and then teaches him the ways of Drifting and then of course, the mentor can only guide the hero, but not actually be there whether because he dies/is wounded BECAUSE of the antagonist. Then the hero goes to avenge his mentor and wins where his mentor could not. Holy crap I was suspended the whole time. Also another thing that gripes me was the stupidest reasons they come up to race. ‘How should we settle this because I wanna lay the smack down on yo ass for talking trash/dishonoring me/talking to my gf/LIKING THIS MOVIE’ ‘Let's race’ This kinda crap gets regurgitated 3-4x throughout the movie 'nuff said. And another thing, it's hard to take the movie seriously when the main Protagonist sounds like the biggest douche ever, if there was ever a ‘Douche of the Year Award’, Lucas Black definitely deserves it. He sounds like Forrest Gump, except that was a decent movie. Seriously, the whole time I was expecting him to say ‘Life is like a box of chocolate, you never know what you're gonna get’ As a final note, unless you are wondering how to screw up a movie so badly where the movie involve cars, hot girls, and Yakuzas with a production budget of millions of dollars then watch this movie, otherwise I think you are better off doing whatever the hell you were doing before reading this review.",MaxX089,2006-06-23,2006
10.0,Good Movie,"I think this movie is far more superior than the first two. The cars are excellent and the special effects raise up your heart beats at times. The setting Tokyo is very interesting, it's quite different from the first two. At first I thought this was going to be a lame movie but it really surprised me, it was more than what I expected. The actors are great, you will never get bored. The plot is intense, there are sad and good moments. I love the movie soundtrack and I love the ending. The ending was the best part. I think this is a must see movie, trust me it wont hurt seeing it. I can't wait to see part 4, I hope it takes place in Tokyo as well.",blue_skyrose,2006-06-23,2006
10.0,Earns the BS stamp of excellence,"Going into this movie, the third fast and the furious i expected a couple of things: 1. fast paced action 2. hot woman but what this installment gives you is that and a whole lot more. It has a deeper plot than the first two and dives deeper into the characters to let you know (or guess) what is happening or what is going to happen and on top of that it even gives you ""quoteable quotes"" to remember the movie by. I enjoyed the way the movie was shot referring to the showing of scenes and then aciton and then scenes but i don't want to give anything away. Other than that it is an excellent summer film that shows you a good time but even makes you think with a good story line and some inner twists. You are missing out by missing this film and that is why i give it the BS (my intials) stamp of excellence.",broccili_beans_3,2006-06-23,2006
7.0,"Very Cool ""Drift""","""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" stars Lucas Black and Bow Wow (grown up Lil' Bow Wow). There are no stars in ""Tokyo Drift"". Then again, the true stars are the ""rice burner"" cars racing through the streets and parking garages in Japan. None of the characters from the last ""The Fast and the Furious"" sequel made the trip to Tokyo. So for Director Justin Lin, he has a formulaic story by Chris Morgan populated with attractive heroes and villains, fast cars, and hot women in a very polished package. Here Lin and Morgan use the exotic locale to highlight the underground extreme sports culture of drifting in Japan. Lin and Morgan also provide insight into modern Japanese culture itselfunexpected and provocative. In a stylish signature scene Japanese young people at night stand along the winding downhill road of the climactic race, send and receive video camera images from each other via their cell phones. Brilliant. Director Lin effectively tells his story through captivating imagery.Shawn Boswell (Lucas Black) is a 17 year-old constantly in trouble for racing muscle cars at school. As the movie opens, his latest run in with the law could land him in jail as an adult. Instead his mother negotiates to have Shawn live with his father in Tokyo. His Dad, Major Boswell (a good Brian Goodman) tells Shawn the house rule is ""No racing"". Shawn attends a rigid Japanese school with the mandatory uniform. It is all very high tech, wireless laptops in the classroom. Every kid has an iPod. Shawn hooks up hipster Twinkie (Bow Wow), who introduces him to the nocturnal world of drifting. Shawn would like to hook up with the beautiful Neela (Nathalie Kelly), but she is with DK (Drift King played by Brian Tee). Shawn loses a race in an inept display to DK. However, in the process Shawn gains a mentor and friend in Han (Sung Kang). Han is DK's business partner. DK's uncle Kamata (Sonny Chiba) is Yakuza. DK is someone not to mess with.From the totally ignorant and fascinated perspective, this is a simplistic take on 'drifting'. You have lightweight high torque cars capable of 130 mph with soft tires for turns. In drifting the driver accelerates the turn with the parking brake engaged. It's kind of like self imposed chaos. You are in control when you are totally out of control. Though DK is the Drift King, Han is the Zen master of drifting. Han confides in Shawn ""It's all about trust and character."" Sung Kang has a presence and ease as Han. Han tells Shawn during his training that he is going to have to figure it out for himself by doing, ""There is no 'wax on, wax off'."" Justin Lin captures the adrenaline rush of extreme speed, and the amazing impassion of the drivers. Lin also paints a fascinating picture of this drift culture metaphor. The Japanese kids during the day wear their pressed uniforms, and attend their classes without question. All is ordered and structured. At the drift races, the girls wear their pimped out Britney Spears clothes, and the guys have their spiked out hair and tatts on display. All shiny objects. Fast high tech cars. Hot girls. All rebellion. Here Lin is all style, and it works. There are no real surprises in terms of story in ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"". Relative newcomer Lucas Black is charismatic and believably pulls off Shawn. Nathalie Kelley is gorgeous and charming in the card board cut-out role of Neela. And remember to stick around till the end for a surprise from Lin. ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" will not win awardsit is just very hip and very cool.",jon.h.ochiai,2006-06-24,2006
6.0,Good racing sequences get lost in a movie with too much talk and similarities to other films.,"High school kid who gets caught racing one time to many is sent off to Tokyo to live with his father. There he finds himself mixed up in the Japanese underworld and racing once more in the ""drifting"" style.This movie has great car sequences, some good characters, some nice lines of dialog and by all rights it should have worked but the film frequently loses sight of whats going on its own world and so we're left to twiddle our thumbs. After a good set up to the story the action moves to Japan. Our hero's dad lays down the law he's to go to school and not race. After an initial run in about staying out late the film jettisons the notion that anyone is in school or that the kid has a curfew and concentrates on the characters and the romance. This would be fine, except that after 20 minutes of set up there really isn't any sort of racing for about 40 minutes (I know I checked my watch). From that point on the film shoots to its conclusion in a rapid and entertaining fashion. Unfortunately the the damage is done and you're not as fully engaged as you should be. Its not bad, hey I didn't walk out, but its not what it should have been.I have to say that the one thing that really bothered me about the movie is that the film is very similar to the Chinese film Initial D, especially in its climatic race. Actually it seemed like a mobbed up version of Initial D with violence added to the story of racing. Its not fatal, but if they wanted to remake that film why change so much of the story?Worth a look on video or cable. Not worth 10 bucks in theaters.",dbborroughs,2006-06-24,2006
6.0,indulgent popcorn fluff,"Rev head Sean has been in trouble with the law for awhile. Hitting his third strike when racing through a construction site, he's shipped over to Japan to live with his father. Instantly on the wrong side of everything, it's not long before he's back into the racing world, introduced to a different style of racing; drifting, using the tightly constructed car parks for races. To full of himself, Sean takes on DK; Drift King, using DK's business partner Han's car. Losing the race and smashing Han's car, Sean becomes in debt to him to pay for the car.The whole of the Fast and the Furious franchise is all about the spectacle. Glossy, fast paced action, great cars, hot women, an abundance of over indulgence. The spectacle is what made the franchise so interesting and so popular. Slapping together a story line to serve the action and badly written dialog are easily over looked, only to the extent that you deliver some amazing action sequences. Director Justin Lin has on account delivered some amazing action scenes. The energy and adrenaline run hard and fast, with tyres screeching at ear piercing levels. This does run off set pieces; the chase through Tokoy city is one great example, leaving you just waiting for the next piece to arrive, though the down side is you have to sit through terrible acting and plot ridden story.When your characters are so broadly drawn and one dimensional, you don't give your actor much to go on; yet they aren't that talented in the first place. Verging on Grease levels of older actors playing teenagers, Lucas Black doesn't have much strength to carry this as the lead Sean, walking around with a stunned mullet. Sonny Chiba comes off cartoonish as a Yakuza boss. Brian Tee lacks menace as DK. Sung Kang does the best performance as Han, not taking his role to any real serious level.If you start to think about all its inconsistencies or take this serious for even a second, it hurts your mind. It's a piece of entertaining popcorn fluff.",nobbytatoes,2006-06-24,2006
8.0,Fast and the Furious: Tokoyo Drift,"Fast, beautiful cars, sexy Asians, and fights....Does that interest you? Because that's what this movie is. Nothing else though since there is no plot.The plot is for some reason the main guy is moved to Tokoyo. In Tokoyo he meets a guy who shows him underground racing, there he is introduced to drifting. He tries racing and gets his ass handed to him. So for most of the movie he does pointless drifting and hitting on this guys girl. His uncle(that he lives with in Tokoyo) doesn't like him driving, but then he ends up letting him do the most dangerous race at the end.The acting alright. The emotion at times was bad, and the main character was absolutely dreadful. Yay, let's put a total hick with a huge accent as the main character and put him with a bunch of Chinese people who can only have two emotions. Mad and calm.The cars were beautiful, as were the girls that were bending over the cars. They choreography of the racing and stuff was very well done, and it looked quite real, so were the crashes.Overall the movie was pretty cool, but a bad plot, but I'd watch it again.",typhill,2006-06-24,2006
10.0,Quite good,Well its a decent film A bit boring as not many races in the designs are a bit rubbish There's not many subtitles to listen to Chinese speaking pretty good visual effects there's a few famous people in you wouldn't expect like Zachery Ty Brian (Zack out of home improvement) Bow Wow Lucas black Brandon Brendel Daniel Booko Chris Astoyan Nikki Griffin etc etc Near the end my girl friend absolutely adored the film as VIN DIESEL is in it i just hope that they make a alternate ending for this where you see them race and Brian catches then in his skyline or something that would be cool this ends my first ever review I'm hoping to submit some more thanks for reading,oliver_197-1,2006-06-24,2006
10.0,Stunts,"I loved the movie so much!!!!!! The stunts in it are amazing and so beautiful. Unfortunately however, the person in charge of this movie actually knows nothing about cars and hardly any of it was actually filmed in Japan (most of it was actually done in California). Nonetheless, I really liked it, simply because the driving stunts were amazing and I'm a big fan of drifting. The cars are all a little too flashy for me, but it's to be expected when the name 'Fast and the Furious' is attached to the title, but still I really like what they did with it. People think that since it's a Fast and the Furious movie that it will such for some reason, or that it's childish. Personally, I think that's stupid on their part. Sure, the character development and the plots a little screwy at times, but in all honesty.... who really goes to see that anyway? It was even said in an article that most people go to see if for the cars and the magazine even admitted to the fact that the writer didn't even remember the names of the people in the first two. I loved the movie, I thought it was amazing and the drivers were all so talented.",Tsubasa_Lillies,2006-06-24,2006
10.0,The Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift is superb,"I'm a great fan of the original Fast and Furious and was extremely excited when 2 Fast 2 Furious was released only to be extremely disappointed. I wasn't to keen on seeing the Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift but i'm really glad i did. This film is superb, its actioned pack and has a genuine believable story line to it that gets you sitting on the edge of your seats. The huge plus to this film was Vin Dieseal even though it was only for a short amount of time. The new cast has brought a fresh and exciting presence to the film. Bring on the 4th Fast and Furious and hopefully we'll see Vin Dieseal in it, as well as all the new cast. That would really bring the story together!!!!!!!",clareski,2006-06-24,2006
10.0,' loved it its was extremely beautiful',"i have loved everyone of the fast and furious films as i love cars and have always wanted to become a female racer. the film was very predictable but all films are. I'm very emotional so me and me female friends cried in the middle though none of the boys did. i loved the romance and the cars and the glamour and gracefulness of drifting. I think all the actors were great even my friends that didn't like cars enjoyed the film. loved it all!!! i feel that i got my moneys worth and that i would recommend this film to anyone, most of all under 30's and not just boys. Its a film i could watch again as it contains my passion for hot cars and partying.",shuger1,2006-06-24,2006
8.0,worth it for the last 2 minutes.........,"all i can say is that the making of a #3 after a horrible #2 was worth it just to see the last 2 minutes...Everyone was ""like how can they make a #3... "" but it was worth it to see the cars, the action and a little fun. unlike the first two which focused on the people and their stories this one had the drama.... car crash after car crash. I think at the end you prayed you wouldn't wreck your car like that.I also love that like the others it had an awesome soundtrack.I do recommend the film to any one who wants some mindless fun entertainment.",bluesweetee,2006-06-25,2006
1.0,What?!??!?!,"Whoever voted for this so highly needs to be educated. The plot was absolutely horrible. How is a race going to settle the conflict? How did a busy Tokyo street completely clear up because he honked his horn. How did he learn to be the best at drifting in a few days when he was no where near a good racer as is. The whole crowd was outraged and laughing at the idiocy of the writers at this part, among many others. There was no depth to any of the characters. We barely saw any nice cars, although the drifting was nice. The whole movie was not tied together at all. I don't want to spoil anything so I'll just leave it at this. Don't pay to see this movie. You will feel gipped.",krenar1,2006-06-25,2006
8.0,i dunno wt film u watched,"okay so most people are expecting another version of the original two. well its not, its a whole new kinda racin. so don't go in expecting to see straight roads. and yeah the film takes a while to get going, but its all info that u need to understand the film.Tokyo drift, still has the cars the all the thrills that the other two had,but in a slightly different way. so don't set your mind on the ova 2, and spoil it 4 yourselves.i say its worth while going to see it in the flicks cause u ain't gona get the entire impact of the film on ur own t.v i hav to say that the small surprise at the end is brill! but hey you'll hav to watch it!",spicinamillion,2006-06-25,2006
7.0,For Once Take The Movie For What It Is!!!!!!!!!,"DAHMMMMM!!!!! For once would you people take a movie for what it is??? Why does every movie that does well on this site have to be a groundbreaking, heart touching, and life changing experience??? The one word to sum up this movie is ""great"". If you love great looking, suped up cars, hot women (especially hot Asian women) this movie is for you. The action in the movie was basically non-stop. There was always a race or chase or something happening to keep the movie flowing. It was never boring and you always were waiting to see what would happen next.Of course there is some cheesy dialogue and a tiny bit of weak acting here and there but its a great action movie and especially if your into cars.Even my girlfriend who I had to basically drag into the theater enjoyed it a lot.The icing on the cake was Vin Diesel's cameo at the end. It was great to see him back behind the wheel and I hope that maybe he would be interested in doing another fast and furious with him starring in it.Simply for what the movie is, its a great movie. I wish this would have been the sequel to the original because if it was I think the series would still be a strong and popular franchise.So all you people who are giving it bad reviews and low rating need to have there head examined. You all need to stop thinking your Roger Ebert and for once enjoy a movie for what it is!",Real_Film,2006-06-25,2006
3.0,An abomination of all that is right in this world.,"This is my first movie review. Prior to this, I had no intention nor any reason that would provoke me to respond to a movie by writing a review. I feel that if you are going to spend ten or twenty minutes of your life in front of a computer in order to deliver a message about a movie to random strangers, the movie has either impressed you and you want to extol the sheer brilliance that you have just witnessed, or the movie was so bad that you want to JUST WARN PEOPLE TO STAY AWAY FROM IT! In the case of The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, this is a HUGE WARNING. If you have a moment, take some time to read ahead and explore the crapfest that is The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. Much, if not all, of this movie is crowded with higher tier actors (Vin Diesel at the end is the only exception... and to be honest... he's not even that great of an actor.. he's just good at his static, one dimensional character roles which require minimal talent). Lucas Black (you know..... that guy from Friday Night Lights...) hardly does any real acting. And of course, Bow Wow tops the list of amazing and talented actors that make up this movie (let's not forget other classic Bow Wow movies such as Johnson's Family Vacation...). Clearly, the script was written by a seventh grader. I see no possible way that a living and breathing human being can come up with so much horrible, gut-wrenching, cheesy, mindless dialogue. Some of the lines are also completely irrelevant to the ‘storyline’ of the movie. They make the characters try to sound deep, but instead they created the biggest over indulgent piece of crap ever known to man. Ten minutes into the movie, and you'll notice the problematic script. Yet the dialogue, sad to say, is not the least of its problems. The storyline. Man, wow............................................................ ............................................................... where do I begin? Sean Boswell is a seventeen year old student who loves to race cars. Challenging the rich kid, he completely destroys his car and is just a short step away from juvy. Instead, he gets sent to Tokyo to live with his father. So far, the plot makes sense. Here's where it goes wrong. Sean Boswell gets drawn to the racing world.... Then an hour of complete crap happens, he learns to drift, and he challenges the nephew of the local mob boss to a race, making it clear to his father that ‘he has to fix this’ ----> yea.... I'm just as lost as you are, the dialogue doesn't help either. Then he wins the race (surprise surprise) and instantly becomes the new King of the racing world. Oh and guess what, he also wins the girl! no movie would be complete unless the guy wins the girl. Anyways, there really is no set plot here. A guy looking to stay out of trouble suddenly becomes the hottest thing in underground racing. Not to mention, the mob boss is a pansy. There really is no bad guy in this movie. You'd figure it would take more than a race for some seventeen year old kid to prove himself to THE MOB. Granted this goes down as a partial mob movie, it is probably the most inaccurate and stupid mob movie of all time. Basically this movie comes down to good looking cars, fast paced action, and Asian cleavage. What the film lacks in consistency, dialogue, acting, and everything else that makes a movie great, it tries to make up for in tight Asian skirts and huge breasts. What gives this movie any hope for a great review is the fast paced racing scenes. If there is anything Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift has done right, it's the racing scenes. I must admit, they were pretty entertaining to watch. Yet that still does not make up for the poor acting, horrible script, and senseless/ridiculous plot that is The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. Had the filmmakers polished up some of these areas, this film might have a fighting chance for a good review. However, right now that is not the case. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a horrible abomination of everything that is right in this world. So far it has prompted a loser like me to sit here at one o'clock in the morning and issue this review/warning to avoid this movie at all costs. Period.",MotoXGT789,2006-06-25,2006
8.0,Much better than the other 2,Where do i start with this film? When i first heard this film wasn't going to have any of the original cast in it i felt rather disappointed but my opinion has totally changed after seeing it for the first time.The cast in it are great.Lucas plays his part well as does bow wow and the guy who plays Han. The things that stood out for me were the racing scenes mainly.There are a lot more than there were in the other 2 films and in my own opinion the races in this third are a lot better than any in the first two. The story isn't half bad either.I actually prefer this one to the 2nd film because of that as well as the racing. This is definitely a must see for all fans of the other two films though.,bopper-5,2006-06-26,2006
2.0,Go instead: Legend of Speed,"This was the least entertaining film I've seen recently. Don't get me wrong, I am a girl AND I enjoyed The Fast and The Furious, as it was a ‘piece of fun’. But this film is exhibit A when people speak of the ‘no plot, all action’ movies that come out of America these days. I had two main problems with this movie: 1) This film was set in Tokyo, yet the main character didn't speak Japanese, he was placed in a school where classes were taught in Japanese. Also, I have never seen so many American-speaking Japanese actors in one movie, this film pays no respect to the culture, showing viewers a false world that Japan is truly accessible to non-Japanese speakers (which is not the case), that the Japanese people are most willing to sideline their own language to benefit one ignorant American person. 2) The great holes in plot was what makes the viewer feel dislocated from the characters, events. It is a rule in film that you have a ‘build’ then a ‘climax’, (meaning that the tension within a story is built, holding the viewer's attention then at the ‘climax’, the viewer feels the desired emotion of the event eg. death, birth, shock) This film does not use this: the plot goes along steadily, then hits ‘climax’-like points without ‘build’ or even explanation! I sat there often thinking ‘who's that?’, ‘what just happened?’ Even with the death of the main character's friend, which was supposed to make the viewer feel sad at that moment, missed target because of no ‘build’. The events went as follows: car business is alerted to money being taken from accounts, car business owner threatens and tries to kill said friend, main character and others escape in a car, friend is getting away as well in another car, friend's car crashes and he burns to death. The death leaves viewers confused as to what they have just seen. We are told hurriedly about the company's accounts, which we really should have been alerted to before, this is truly poor scripting. Overall, I find this movie to be too loose in the story-telling, not enough research was done about the location. I wasn't even too fond of the ‘drifting’. The final race between the main character and his nemesis was too close to being reminiscent of the Speed Racer series, for my liking. If you want a movie in a similar vein, try ‘The Legend of Speed’. It did what the filmmakers were trying to achieve here.",angel_starfine,2006-06-26,2006
10.0,Well ....kinda cool..,"Got my movie from a local area server(fortunately it was the good screen version one), shoved it in my usual player, got my popcorn, lay-ed back on my chair and pressed play... Well, the second Fast and Furoius had a cooler UNIVERSAL promo... At first i thought it was going to be a teenager kind of movie and got disappointed, but after a while, it started to catch me... What can i say...the special effects got me off the chair... made me press that rewind button:)) The movie has some awesome special effects and a nice story...even dough it is standard... they fight over a girl, but in overall it is cool. I recommend this movie to anybody that likes speed and shiny stuff... It made me wanna get my 318i and try to make some drifts:D kids don't try this at home!!",wndol,2006-06-26,2006
10.0,F&F 3 Rocked,"Fast and the Furious:Toyko Drift was an excellent movie. The races were interesting and the movie kept my attention the whole time. Some of the scenes of the movie had me on the edge of my seat, unlike the other 2, where I could fall asleep and miss nothing. Bow Wow did an excellent job (he actually looked like he belonged in the high school). The scenery was cool, especially the parking garage.The only draw back was that Vin Diesel only made a cameo, and the main racer was supposed to be under 18 and he looked like he was in his 30's. Other than that it rocked. The cars kicked butt (so did the paint jobs). It's a good movie to go see if you are bored out of your mind and you want to see something that will get you blood flowing.",buffyangelspikeyscoobysb,2006-06-26,2006
10.0,Destined to be a Cult Classic,"Tokyo Drift is going to be one of those love it, hate it movies, much like 2001: A Space Odyssey and other cult classics. For those who are in to cars, this movie much like the first of the series brings a never-before-seen aspect of car driving to the silver screen. The drifting scenes are revolutionary and exciting; it may be remembered as the Bullit of the 21st century. It may do for drifting what the other previous two series did for tuning. That is bringing it out of the underground and making it more mainstream. Unlike other director who might of taken the short-cut and the easy way out of using CG to create the drift scenes. Director Justin Lin actually used real drivers and cars, which helps to bring a level of realism not found in other films. Justin Lin also accomplishes that he is so adapt at, that is portraying a part of Asian youth culture that the general public usually doesn't now see.The story itself is a trial and trued pattern of forbidden romance. Although the plot may lack originality, it is far from boring. But the focus of the film is on the cars and the driving and not on the plot. I think this is where the film gets into trouble with critics who lack the appreciation of the cars and the driving scenes. Many reviewers get lost in trying to find something from this film that is not meant to be there. If you want they want something mind opening, watch Brokeback Mountain. If you want to watch a movie for exciting and great action/driving scenes that you wouldn't be ashamed to talk to your friends about, watch this movie.",liubhs02,2006-06-26,2006
8.0,Much Better than I Expected,"I fought with my friends to not see this movie. I begged, pleaded, and stomped my feet. Then, I gave in and loved it. Compared to the other two, this movie is alone. I loved the driving. I loved the acting and the character interaction. I even loved the cars, thought I am definitely a muscle fan. My heart did sink a bit when the Nissan engine got put in the beautiful Ford Mustang. But that has nothing to do with this. I really felt something when one of the characters died, as did, I believe, everyone in the theater. The acting really is superb. The end was a touch cheesy and the last 15 seconds does tie the 3 movies together well, but I say, ‘Forget those others then you see this movie.’ Enjoy this beauty of a racing movie.",MysteryMovieMan,2006-06-26,2006
4.0,this movie sucks,"OK, not only does it not make sense, the story is just stupid and boring.I watched the whole thing without sleeping only because I kept waiting for some good car action ... but it never came.Oh, and they smash up almost every car. It almost made me cry tears of rage ... such a waste of nice cars (not that you really get to see what they are anyway).They should've just focused on the cars.... Instead they tried a story as well and blew the whole movie. Nothing in it was enjoyable.At first I saw Bow Wow was in the movie. So naturally I thought ... dam Bow Wow is a great rapper, so this should help the movie. Instead, his character is a criminal loser, with the most stupid ride I've ever seen.Then the opening scene with the usual college kids trying to be baddass and the *good strong kid* against them. Dam ... he was supposed to be a hero but instead he gets owned ... and this is the main character I'm talking about.So then I thought, wow, so maybe he gets off to a slow start and he starts showing some skills in Tokyo. Nope. He just goes from one stuff-up to the next. And someone always ends up giving him something else to stuff up and the movie goes on and on. The whole way through I'm in disbelief and trying to keep myself from falling asleep by thinking that he will finally show some skills and own up the bad guys.Then that moment comes and he wins ... but its such an anti-climax. Not sure why. I think its because I never really saw any good skills. Or maybe its cos there was no point to the win. Or maybe its because I never really got a sense of the racing. Or maybe its because their race 'tactics' involve smashing into the opponents car. Dunno.",joshuabeattie1,2006-06-27,2006
10.0,Tokyo Drift,"‘The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift’ is the third of the F&F movies; it delivers all the races and crashes you could possibly desire, and a little more. After only one day in school, Sean (Lucas Black) is offered a customized street speedster, and is racing down the ramps of a parking garage against the malevolent D.K. The racing strategy is called ‘drifting.’ It involves sliding sideways while braking and accelerating, and the races involve a lot of hairpin turns. The movie ends with a warning that professional stunt drivers were used, and we shouldn't try this ourselves. Like the stunt in ‘Jackass’ where the guy crawls on a rope over an alligator pit with a dead chicken hanging from his underwear, it is not the sort of thing likely to tempt me.",tipharris12,2006-06-27,2006
7.0,Tokyo Drift.....drifting away from the plot...,"First off, I quite liked this movie. For a movie that followed on the heels of 2Fast this is an achievement. 2Fast was just just lameness personified. Tokyo Drift, or 3Fast, as I will refer to it, was much more restrained. Sure, it had foolish plots, love story, fast, scalextric like cars and all, but it was less....stupid. At least, for 90% of the movie. There are two things that really stand out as a ‘spit-your-coke-into-the-hair-of-the-guy-sitting-in-front’ moments.’ Firstly, and right from the start, we are expected to believe that the lead character is 17 years old. This is the same trick that was pulled in Biker Boyz and it doesn't work here either. Granted, the age difference wasn't as great here, but the guy is actually 24, not 17, and looks nearer 30. Not good for suspension of disbelief. Secondly, towards the end, having peed-off the local crime boss, the ‘hero’ boldly goes into the lion's den to make amends and settle honour.......by suggesting a car race with the loser leaving town! I'm not sure if it was intentional or not, but Sonny Chiba really did look completely non-plussed at the suggestion. You knew it had to happen...it's a car racing movie, after all, but it was just ridiculous. A car race to the death, or the loser having finger's cut-off.....maybe. But not leaving town! Beyond lameness. There are bright spots, though. The racing is pretty entertaining, and they've done away with the ‘hyperspace’ graphics when someone presses the nitrous button. There are a few scenes where the ‘hero’, whilst learning to drift, thwacks a wall and the car doesn't show the damage in the next scene, but does at the end, but that is just down to bad editing. You'd think it'd be easy enough these days to CGI a few dents in for effect. Also good was Sung Kang, as Han (not as in Han Solo, though he has some of the same qualities) who is by far the most likable of all the characters in the film, with his life-zen outlook and easy manner. He steals most scenes he's in, without really even trying. And there is the obligatory cameo at the end from a certain former Fast and Furious star. Not sure whether this was to give the film some kind of ‘legitimacy’ in the franchise, or to hint at his involvement in the inevitable next movie. Either way, an interesting little scene right at the end. Overall then, better than the second movie by far, but still not up to the first one. But worth a watch, nonetheless.",Rob_Taylor,2006-06-27,2006
10.0,As the Summer movies go!!!,I have been to the midnight openers of all the summer Blockbusters. After each of theses movie so far (not including Pirates thats next week) my friends and myself walk out of the theater poking holes in each of the movies.X-men - one battle. Cruse impossible - same old thing... whats newSuperman - only showed up 3 or 4 time in the movie F&F - From beginning to end. So far the best of the summer. It is not Hollywood like the first or Miami Vice Like the second one. It is the first time that Hollywood has made a action movie right for the MTV gen.SEE THE MOVIE - and tell me where I am wrong!,alecia-steiner,2006-06-28,2006
3.0,Not the best of the lot,"Graphics were alright, but other than that it was pretty awful. Acting was pretty average, and the story line was a bit too cheesy. If I could, i would certainly go and get my money back, although I can't deny that the sound of the engines was nice to hear on the surround sound. The camera angles made the driving seem too easy, and just the whole idea of racing on the streets of Tokyo in the middle of so much traffic is just hard to swallow... Won't recommend that you go and waste the money in to watch in theaters, but it might be worth the watch on DVD if you have nothing better to do. I think i liked the second one the best out of the three F&F movies, but even that one wasn't worth paying, so you can probably guess how horrible the acting was.",Omarsolaija,2006-06-28,2006
9.0,I liked it!,"It may not win an Oscar but i liked it, very much!Don't expect a good story, cuz it doesn't make any sense. Don't expect good actors, cuz thay suck ,specially the main guy. Don't expect being on ""the edge of your seat"", cuz there is a few boring parts.Do expect cars. fast, new and beautiful cars. Do expect special effect, cuz there is a lot from where they came from. Do expect good music, hip hap music that will sound good in your car when the movie will release on DVD's.To sum up, take your best friends and enjoy a 2 hours of fun. If you crazy about cars, you going to love it.peace!",mar741,2006-06-28,2006
7.0,"Not bad, better than the last.","This film was definitely not as bad as the second. OK, they've all been fairly rubbish, but in a good ‘enjoy them with a few friends and a few beers’ kind of way! It was a good way to distract yourself for a few hours, and I could think of worse ways to spend £6. The plot was slightly better (although still fairly crap) than before, and the actors weren't too bad. The cars and race scenes were up to their usual standard and looked pretty slick - I think the reason this one's about drifting is so they could tie-in the fantastic number of gear changes used throughout the series. The addition of several hundred hot Asian woman wearing very little could only be described as the icing on top! The appearance of Vin Diesel made the film for me, it was uber-cheesy and had me in stitches.",ilikeyoghurt,2006-06-28,2006
6.0,cars in the rising sun,"Mark Kermode always warns against seeing films which are based on computer games. Theyare all meant to be awful without any plotting instead relying on brand recognition and glossy producing and a couple of good looking women. Go back and watch Citizen Kane then. This is fun, rookie driver with dark past, we've heard it over and over again for 60 years ""I'm troubled, I let someone down"" so we know where we're starting from. He goes to Japan to take part in a lame macho, genital waving affair of motor racing. The usual dichotomy of good and bad guys who fit clear personality types with no ambiguity as usual. Then the cars do their thing and thats what you've been waiting for. I and some others ended up seeing this as a result of the actress Ashika Gogna and another who had been used as a part of a painting by the actor and scientist Stephen Armourae. Knowing her had an eye for a good thing (or what he likes) I gave this movie a go, it was a pleasant surprise that despite all its clichés it was entertaining and if cars are your thing you sure will be happy. Plenty of handbrake turns and snarling bad guys trying to crash our hero",faheemzaiz,2006-06-28,2006
9.0,Turns out I am a red blooded male!!,"I saw the very first Fast and The Furious a lot of years ago and I only remember I didn't like it at all. I'm just not a car guy, I don't known the difference between an engine block and a car stump and Nascar or any car racing usually bores me to tears. I never even bothered seeing the second installment of this series and I had no desire at all to see this third one despite my love for movies which eventually is what caused me to see it. I had nothing else to see and I really wanted to go to the movies so there I was sitting in the theater and all car movies are usually described as ‘High Octane’ but Fast and The Furious Tokyo Drift defines that!! How great is it when a film you have such low expectations of turns out to be incredible?? That's exactly what happened for me with this film. Not only are the car race and chase scenes edge of your seat, beautifully and brilliantly choreographed, but the story is really good!! The performances from the cast are also really good. It was an all around great movie that is definitely worthy of a night out. Lucas Black who has done some great work as of recently in Jarhead, and Cold Mountain plays country boy who loves his cars Sean Boswell. Black plays Boswell like the absolutely perfect hero. He's rough, tough, don't mess with him, but at the same time, loyal, handsome, even suave in a country kind of way. And on top of that he's completely out of his element by dropping into the high speed world of Tokyo street racing and Tokyo in general. Such a huge part of the greatness of this film is seeing this boy completely out of his element determined to win back the thing he knows best...racing. He's never quite the underdog but you absolutely root for him. Black does a really great job and I think this film could really be a stepping stone for him to leading man status. Newcomer Nathalie Kelley plays Black's love interest, and racing fanatic herself Neela. Now for an actress, especially a newcomer to hold her own in an absolutely testosterone driven film is pretty impressive and she does exactly that. I still wouldn't say her performance is fem-powered, I mean the girls are still somewhat trivialized as ‘car-babes’ but for the only leading female role she does very well. Her and Black's character have good strong chemistry and she drives with the best of them when you finally see her behind the wheel. I am positive you haven't seen the last of Nathalie Kelley. Bow Wow (formerly Lil) plays hustler Twinkie (Twink.) I have to say that Bow Wow is not one of the stronger performances in the film. He does alright but he is definitely overshadowed but strong performances by Black in the lead role and the other characters around him. His character I think is a lot weaker than the others and it makes it hard to be a decent role. Mostly a TV actor Brian Tee plays bad guy/tough guy D.K. (Drift King.) He is absolutely excellent as the bad guy, even though he does come across as something of a schmuck, I think that's the idea. He is the perfect contrast and adversary to Black's Sean Boswell. D.K. is everything that Boswell isn't and has his girl, his talent, and his cars. I would like to see Tee in a hardcore bad guy role in the future, he was excellent and you hated him but knew it was going to be fun to watch him get his in the end. Sung Kang is terrific as D.K.'s business partner but also adversary secretly. Kang plays Han who immediately takes to Sean Boswell and brings him aboard convinced he is a trustworthy person to have on his side which definitely turns out to be true. Kang's performance is subtle, quiet, but really good. He is a mentor and kind of an anti-hero in many ways. Great performance!! Director Justin Lin captures the Asian street world in such a way that it just draws you in. Scenes of Tokyo alone are stunning and seeing Lucas Black's character dealing with not only the street world but school and every day life in a completely foreign atmosphere gives this film so much more than just car racing. It has such depth and really an interesting and powerful movie. I don't know if it's action or drama but somewhere in the middle is something that for a third installment to a series about car racing is so impressive!! And even myself NOT being a fan of the series the twist surprise cameo at the end was awesome and brought a smile to my face since there was no real connection to the other films until that moment. Beginning to end it locked me in and left me on the edge of my seat with amazing performances, terrific scenery and direction and great characters. Absolutely worthy of seeing!! I may even go back and try the first two again in honor of this one. 9/10",Robert_duder,2006-06-29,2006
1.0,Behhh...i want my money back,I think that this movie should be buried in the dessert and left to rot I would have rather given the money I spent on the ticket to a crack head! The movie started great if was full of action and suspense then about 5 minutes in it died. HOW does some Alabama white boy end up in JAPAN! COMON! The drifting was bull I have been to many professional drift tracks and the crap in the movie was completely beyond the odds of physics... not to mention the dialog! Like someone wrote the script on the inside of a pack of matches from a strip club. Get real and VIN DEASEL? Wtf are you doing man... OH Ya a mustang with a RB26DETT???? FIND ME SOMEONE THAT CAN MOUNT THAT OR FOR THAT MATTER FIND A RIGHTHAND DRIVE COLOM BOX AND DRIVESHAFT! Get real this movie was a joke and i'm sure many people will agree.,sekondjenrx7,2006-06-29,2006
6.0,More of a comedy than an action movie,"The movie wasn't too bad, at least not as bad as some of the other movies that are still out. I didn't like Bow Wow's character too much. He seemed out of place in Tokyo and I'm not saying that just because he is not Asian. Twinkie, Bow Wow's character, seemed a little too...American for Japan. He had been living there longer than Sean, yet Sean some how managed to learn more Japanese than him. And Sean never did really get the girl. Sure, there were implications that they liked each other, but there's no romance in their relationship at all. My friends didn't really appreciate how Sean, a white man who had just moved to Japan, became the new DK or Drift King. And why was Vin Diesel in it exactly? What I did like about this movie is how funny it was. I'm sure the writers weren't aiming for funny, but my friends and I just found the entire movie hysterical. Like why was it that the whole entire school was into drifting? And there was this one scene where they were racing in a crowded street and everyone just somehow knew they were drifting and formed the shape necessary for the drift to occur. If you want a good laugh, this is the perfect movie from you.",justloseit04,2006-06-29,2006
10.0,The best among the three,"I just saw this film last Friday. This movie made my contact lens dry for not blinking my eyes because it was just thrilling and a little exciting. It has got the best stunts, the background music really suited in this movie. For me, this is the best the fast and the furious have ever made so far. Lucas Black's character as Sean is good for him. It made him look hot. He had to go in Japan to not be in the jail. Though he's forbidden to race he's still do it, thanks to Twinkie he showed a little world of best cars to Sean. I like the car of Twinkie here, cool, huh? Anyway, it reminds me the Japanese Anime Initial D because they both just pretty alike, Sean reminds me the main protagonist Takumi and Sean's father reminds me the father of Takumi. I like Sean here, he's very well-determined and practice for him makes him perfect to drift. This movie is good for the car lovers, if you want to drift, think first what would be may happen to you.",Erollynx,2006-07-30,2006
10.0,Kung Sang,"I'm just writing this because I was excited to see him in Fast and the Furious, Tokyo Drift. I'm a big fan! I have seen his other movies. This one has a special feel for me, his character was cool although died at the end. I liked him in Better Luck Tomorrow, thats how I started viewing his films, too bad that there is not much information in the internet about him. I liked all of the Fast and the Furious movies, but this third one is my favorite. Its different and plus the setting is nice. I really like the cars, these performance cars has never really left the scenes, specially in Asia and that is highly appreciated.",ana-diego8,2006-07-01,2006
1.0,terrible,"ooh my god. that was a mess. i didn't like it at all. it is like they gathered the ugliest people in the world in this movie. that dude (shan or whatever), what is wrong with his speech? i mean he cant talk normally, and to be honest the other main characters of the previous ""fast and furious"" series were like prince charming compared to this one. and that Japanese dude (DK) he is too ugly too. i didn't like the way he looks at people and the way he talks. and the scenario was horrible too. the only thing i liked in this movie was the cars. and of course bow wow. he plays damn good, and talks cool. he met my expectations. i voted this movie 1 out of 10. this movie sucks.",matricha,2006-07-01,2006
10.0,The Fast and The Furious's third installment may have changed location but it still is a well-put-together movie,"The third installment of The Fast and the Furious combines great action sequences and a strong plot to make a movie that may match the first Fast and the Furious. the races and chases through the Tokyo streets keep you on the edge of your seat the hole way through. Lucas Black delivers a spectacular performance of young teen who finds his calling under the tutelage of Han, a man of authority in the Tokyo underground. This film does live up to the standard set by the first Fast and the Furious. from an amateur vs. expert drifting race to a drifting chase through the streets of Tokyo, to a final climactic race down a mountain, the scenes are full of believable action. The audience goes on a adventure that will leave them wanting more. This movie is one of the best this summer and is a must-see.",Kieranmitch,2006-07-01,2006
7.0,Moving it to Japan made it worthwhile for me,"OK I'll concede it wasn't quite as good as the first two, but I still enjoyed this film. I felt that moving the location to Japan and introducing a new style of racing made a decent job of making the movie fresh.If it had just been another American coastal city (LA or Miami) with a bunch of regular drag races with some of the same people as the other two, it would have been a boring movie. But by having cute little Japanese girls wearing the skimpy outfits this time around, and featuring the beautiful backdrop of Tokyo (for some of the scenes anyway), and by using a fresh and totally new cast, I felt it made the movie worth one viewing.Plus I liked the cars as much or better than the cars of the first two films. The 460 HP twin turbo Nissan 350Z was an awesome machine for DK to drive in the film. I really loved the modified RX-7 with Han. Even the RX-8 was nice to look at, almost as nice to look at as the driver Neela. A lot of people made a beef about putting a Skyline engine in the old '67 Mustang, but at the same time, every single car in the film and in the street/drift racing scene has 95% of the original body/engine parts removed and/or replaced anyway, so what's the big deal with giving it a different engine? This isn't' the greatest movie ever made. But if you just want a nice 95 minute cheap thrill ride while looking at cute girls cheering on the guys driving their $60,000 turbocharged rides, it's solid entertainment.",ccaudle,2006-07-02,2006
3.0,You can find better activities than this,"I was never a fan of sport/race cars, but it's always interesting to watch high speed and thrilling race. In this movie, only two things may catch your eye - nice chicks, when they appear and good looking cars... and... that's it, folks.It could be quite a good comedy, when you can see a car breaking the speed of 1 Mach (it means velocity of sound, ~330m/s) and when camera suddenly goes to a cabin and shows the speedometer and you see ""WOW! it's whole 90 km/h"" - that's pathetic. Today's scooters can reach that speed at ease.At the final race you can see a secret Japanese ""transportation system"" used. How can people standing at one point film whole race lasting approx. 5 minutes, when cars reach speed of 200 km/h ?? A real phenomenon movie. Film director and screen writer must have been facing brain meltdown, when filming this.By the way, about FX - they totally suck, for example, if you look at the car crash (at about little more than 1h from the start of the movie) you can see a disgusting computer graphics work at it. To be straight I mean, when the 3D parts at the side of the engine are shown.In overall, a nice sci-fi movie (perhaps word ""science"" should be omitted).",Odysei,2006-07-03,2006
6.0,"2 Fast, 2 Furious ... but unfortunately 2 Much","Lucas Black takes the leading role from Paul Walker in this the third outing of the Fast & Furious series, that - unlike the previous two movies - focuses on the art of 'drifting'. Director Justin Lin does a decent enough job here, with a lot to contend with from its superb predecessors. The setting is the streets of Tokyo, Japan, as Lucas Blacks character is shipped off from the US to Japan in order to avoid jail. There he gets involved in the underworld car racing, or should I say car drifting, scene.The acting is average at best, with the relatively unknown Black doing the best he can, but clearly lacking experience. The racing scenes are, as expected, top notch, but the plot just seems silly, and it is these racing scenes that are needed to carry the film through to the end. The main problem with this film is that it really needed a stronger on screen presence, but since none of the original cast returned and all the actors are relatively unknown this was clearly lacking. Overall it was an average attempt at a movie. The action is good but the acting and plot struggle throughout, and I think personally this was significantly lacking when compared to the first two movies. Without spoiling the film, there is a nice surprise during the final couple of minutes, that added a point to my rating, but it wasn't enough. It gets an average rating of 6-10 - watchable.C><",craigy101,2006-07-03,2006
10.0,What an adrenaline rush!,"OK, well it wasn't an Oscar winning kind of movie, nor was it meant to be, but it is an amazing thrill ride that doesn't slow down. Before i went to this movie on the opening weekend, i had read some bad reviews of it and so i went in with mixed thoughts. But i came out with a clear thought in my mind, WHAT A FILM!It is so well directed and the actors are perfect in each role and the cars, wow! (but that mustang at the end would have never drifted like that)Don't listen to all the a******s who keep moaning about it being to unrealistic. Just go in for a good fun 2 hours that really gets your blood rushing! If you liked the two previous movies then you will love this one. I am a huge car and fast and the furious fan, and i really enjoyed this one and it is by far the best in the series (you may not like Lucas Blacks accent in it, but you may get used to it).",Tom-AVA,2006-07-03,2006
6.0,Could do with some polishing.,"I'll say the first thing that came to mind when I was going to offer my comments/reviews on this film: The first two were obviously better. Mainly because the story lines were thought about carefully. FF3 was to me, absolute rubbish in certain parts of the film. But I think I thoroughly enjoyed most of the action with the cars and because I love Japan, it was nice to see great views of it from every aspect. (From city night life to the school life) As much as I also enjoyed see a certain someone at the very end, it actually made the ending quite pathetic. I saw no logic behind it.But nonetheless, I enjoyed this film but I'm still deciding as to whether or not I should purchase the DVD. Soundtrack is a definite must though.",vanessa-jane-c,2006-07-03,2006
10.0,Tokyo Drift will make you drool on yourself.,"If your a big fan of the series like I am, you got to see this movie.First off, the movie stars Lucas Black(Shawn Boswell)who gets in trouble back home and is forced to move to Toyko to live with his dad to avoid jail time.+ The sound effects are awesome, whether it's shifting gears, or hearing the rubber burn off the tires as they drift down the hill, believe me, you will hear the noise. + The music is good especially because it fits in with the whole theme. It seems to me its some kindof Japanese music which is self-explanatory. + The plot was great in my opinion is one of the best action movies of the year! If you want action, and you love the franchise, then you have to see this. You'll be surprised at the end of who shows up. + Not only do you get action, but a little comedy in there. I laughed pretty hard at some of the things Shawn would say. It seems to me that some parts of the movies were dragged out. They could have left some scenes out but overall nothing else is bad about the movie. Hope you like the movie.",ADPollock1188,2006-07-04,2006

8.0,a cool movie that presents modern tokyo and has awesome drifting and action,"i personally LOVED this movie! and so did all my friends who watched it in the theatre with me:]As a overseas military brat, living in japan, and being half Japanese, i could really relate to the movie. Over here, drifting is definitely the cool thing to do. I don't know how popular it is in the states but here, anyone that is into cars is in love with drifting! So it was really cool to see all the action and the awesome stuff the characters did in the movie!The movie actually covers a lot of what japan really is, which makes me really happy. I don't think a lot of Americans really know what modern tokyo is really like. The girls are seriously annorexic! And the fashion is wild! A lot of girls where clothes that BARELY cover them. Short skirts, hooker style. Either that or they have some REALLY weird fashion, uber Gothic, or hair with crazy colors and weird cuts! Some of the things in the movie aren't really accurate, but overall you can see what the real japan is like in this movie! We don't carry samurai swords anymore. sorry...Even if you don't know anything about drifting, you should give this movie a shot, because there is a nice plot to it and the action sequences are amazing. It'll always have you on the edge of your seat, and cringing at every close call or gasping when there is an accident.i haven't seen the other fast and furious movies, but i loved this one and if you like action driven movies, this is the one for you!",meloncoke-1,2006-07-04,2006
7.0,Stupid but fun; probably unintentionally.,"While this is one of the stupidest movies ever, it was fun to watch. We ended up regularly laughing with/at the movie and everybody in my group who went to see it said they enjoyed it. When you combined this with the fact that it had some gorgeous women, it was a surprisingly fun movie. Even if you are not up to the Herculean task of suspending disbelief when watching this movie, it can be ""fun"". However, it is not, however, a ""good"" movie. While the adults playing teenagers do not even look the part, the character motivations are incomprehensible, the dialog is puerile, and many of the vehicular stunts are far-fetched, the movie is inexplicably fun to watch (with a group).",garretsr,2006-07-04,2006
3.0,Cheese Fest!,"Where do i start? This movie is just an excuse to flaunt sexy cars and women. There is no real, believable plot. In the first half of the film, it's in too much of a rush to race and it's soooooo cheesy at the beginning when the blonde says ""The winner get's me"". OMG - i was sat in the cinema thinking - do i really have to sit through this!? But it did get better towards the end. I'll be it, I love the race's and beautiful cars (that's why i've given it 3 points) but it's not enough JUST to have that going for it.Okay, does it make sense that three of the main characters are American and one is Austrailian but it's all based in Japan? Maybe the ""army brat"" background could have been feasible for one, but i think they went a bit over the top. If you were going to cast American's as the main characters, base it in America! I hope that the producers decide that this is the last Fast and the Furious. The first two were great, it should have ended there with Paul Walker if you ask me.The ONLY thing i was really impressed with was the soundtrack.",SwampyMcDizzle,2006-07-05,2006
9.0,Great Film...Best out of the Three!,"I watched the first two movies before watching this one and i thought ‘no way is this gonna surpass the first film…’ o man how wrong i was! opening credits...as soon as the film started, it was great, it introduced a young (not cop) character and showed him in his daily life. the first race! omg, best first race out of all the films, 1. raced for a girl and didn't get her which was funny and 2. the race was intense and put you straight into it. moving to Tokyo was great, seeing the customs and changes he had 2 endure then the whole movie took off. the characters all developed well with the story, and i actually felt bad when Han died. the cars were all as usual, great! especially the HULK mobile! lol the final race was off the scale and D.K getting owned by his uncle made everything better! overall.....AWESOME! best out of the three without a doubt, all we have to hope for now is a 4th film with the main 4 guys teaming up or something...lets hope!",nathanhannah_rulez,2006-07-05,2006

And the motor would fit in the engine bay of the mustang. Other than that the movie was very very very good, but to all of those people out there who think drifting is easy, you are wrong, drifting is very hard a should NOT be attempted on the streets. Drifting is a motor sport which should be left on the track. this fast and the furious is the best yet, and if there are more to come i hope that the movie makers find a better way to keep the attention of the audience, because Tokyo drift was action from the start to the finish.",fireball138,2006-07-06,2006
8.0,An action flick that thrives on its unique style and cinematography,"As a loyal fan to modified cars, I very much enjoyed watching The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift and would highly recommend it. I feel that this movie successfully differentiated itself from the other two movies in the franchise to create a new ""Fast-paced"" viewing experience as well as highlight the directors style. Despite views from critics, I hold this movie in high regards for what it has, rather than what it lacks in the acting and storyline department.What I most enjoyed about this movie was its perspective, and style utilized in displaying the action. Not only did it use unique camera angles and cinematography, the techniques and devices in general were well suited to the location and essence that the movie delivers. It is set in Tokyo, where fast cars, latest fashion, and state-of-the-art gadgets are abundant. To compliment this, my favorite cinematography device was the camera shots through the mobile phones. Personally I found that worked exceptionally well, and made for some great eye candy.I pity all critics that denote this movie in terms of acting, plot etc. What they seem to understand is that this sort of movie criteria is important and must be executed. What they don't understand is that this movie criteria is unessential for this genre of movie. Any survey done on behalf of this movie will prove that viewers of this action genre, come to see action and great visuals, rather than big name actors and intellectually challenging plots.I give this movie a generous 7/10 simply because i felt the action was unique, which included never before seen cinematography. Critics can say what they may about the acting, or the storyline, yet it is important to realize that this criteria was executed adequately, and that the movie was successful in delivering a great viewing experience.",EdwinTetlow141,2006-07-06,2006

Yes, I know the first two F&F were considered dumb, not worthy. Some of that I think is a residual class bias in the US. Muscle cars and racing has always been a trailer park thing. True enough and the stories, all three of them are cluttered with cultural touchstones: dumb, honest, sublegal. And the trailer park notion of girls as prizes.Well, if you are serious about movies, you pretty much ignore the stories. And in summer movies you know the icons transcend their cultural places and move to a grander cinematic place. So a hillbilly isn't a hillbilly, more of a hillbillybillboard. The real appeal is in whether it is cinematic or not. Now this is a tricky issue, and a matter of taste. Tarantino, for example, obnoxiously advertises the cinematic overloading of ""Bill,"" but that's just inventory, right? The Coens seem more genuine and satisfying. But with the Fast and Furious projects, the idea was a nostalgic one, to recall an obsolete cinematic value: the car chase. More, to do it without computer graphics, but with camera angles now common from the CGI era. In movielanguage, this is called doing it ""practically,"" meaning with real cars, mountains, cameras.Computer graphics is still enough artificial that we know the difference. That matrix highway fight or any one of the mission impossible deals might be exciting, but there's an extra edge to knowing that something is real. Like a Buster Keaton or Harold Lloyd stunt. The first F&F simply mined this. I liked it enough to consider my cinematic mind massaged. The second one obviously responded to market research that showed huge ticket sales in Asia. So they retooled the whole thing, both in the story (Asian girls, Asian cars), in the style (neon) and in the film-making itself.A huge hit in Asia. US viewers were almost disposable.Now this third one: actually set in Tokyo though filmed in LA. Its a step down in style: the production design is not nearly as polished and cool, instead it is more industrial, cheaper to do. The F&F production sponsors clearly are settling in for the long haul where they can make one of these every year or so indefinitely. Oddly, the sexy bodies  traditionally the cheapest thing you can get  are played down in this one.Anyway, the real value in this is the camera rush. There's some cool folding at the race at the end where phonecams merge with the cameras we see through. We become the spectators on the side of the road.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",tedg,2006-07-06,2006
4.0,This one's all smoke and mirrors,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, or 3 Fast 3 Furious as my friends jokingly called it, is the story of a troubled youth who is sent to Tokyo to his father in hopes he will stop his ways as a trouble maker and buckle down and focus on school. However, instead of focusing on school he falls in with a crowd of street racers who specialize in the racing style of ‘drifting’. Throw in some crap about the Yakuza (japanese mafia) and a protagonist who has the usual hissy fit about the main character ‘talking to his girl’ and you have a typical bland modern special effects show-off crap-a-rama. The writers throw together the usual Fast and the Furious storyline of a bunch of people who do nothing all day and race at night in cars that might cost more than your average American home, yet these people are not even slightly remorseful when the presumably 6 figure car is absolutey totaled. In fact most of the time they can be seen a few scenes later in another extremely expensive car that seems to build itself out of nowhere. This story is pretty much the exact same as 2 Fast 2 Furious, except it's in Japan. The acting isn't anything spectacular, in some spots it's downright poor. The race scenes are little drawn out and get boring after awhile. It's the usual cookie cutter action movie, forbidden love story-check, rich over privledged immature protagonist-check, crime syndicate tie in-check. There really isn't much story to spoil, it plays out exactly as you would imagine. Only go to see this one if you really cars or crappy cookie cutter modern movies.",Hungry-Dingo,2006-07-06,2006
10.0,Adrenaline Rush - Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift is a solid good third entry action flick!,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) in my opinion I think is a solid good action sequel, a very bashed and hated in the series. Which I don't think this movie is bad, I think is a much better movie than Furious 7. I always loved this movie, I think it is a good movie, but in the series is not the worst one, but is far from worst one that would be Furious 7. I think it was a different solid, good sequel in the series and I love it for an action film. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a fun movie to watch: it accomplishes what it set out to do and that's provide the most realistic yet gravity-defying racing sequences, backed with the eye-catching background of the electrifying, neon Tokyo. Plot-wise it suffers a bit and the acting isn't top-notch, otherwise the loud music, import cars, cityscape Tokyo, and Japanese pop culture more than make up for the flaws of the film that you'll watch it again and again.Plot: When convicted street racer Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) tries to start a new life on the other side of the world, his obsession with racing sets him on a collision course with the Japanese underworld. To survive, he will have to master drifting—a new style of racing where tricked-out cars slide through hairpin turns, defying gravity and death for the ultimate road rush.This movie is more the highest-octane installment of the hit movie franchise built for speed! There are more mind-blowing stunts and heart-pounding racing sequences than ever, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift will put you in the driver's seat. ""Strap yourself in for a blistering, super-charged ride.""-- Pete Hammond, Maxim"" The CGI I am sorry but in one way it is terrible which I really did not like when Sean (Lucas Black) and Neela (Nathalie Kelley) are slide down with the car during the car chase and they cross over the crowd of people without hitting anyone, you can see the camera, that it is made with a CGI that is the only main problem I have with the film, the rest was okay. This is a very simple film, not a big confusing plot and again this films, you know 5,6 and 7 the plots are still pretty simplistic.5 was a heist movie, 6 was this guy the evil version of you, we want him to bring him down simple.7 you killed this guy's brother, he is looking for revenge and he also try's to kill you so you get this, simple movie not complicate at all. That is one thing that this movies get right constantly.The racing in this movie: I think they did a better job than in 2, because I didn't noticed more of a CGI, because that's how they just do it now, a lot of wide shot you can tell there was a lot of practical stunt drive, it look good which I enjoyed that. I know a lot of people will put this movie lover down and I think it is a solid movie and a solid flick. This is the first time Brian Tyler made the score and this is also the first one that Justin Lin directed, he went later directing three next movies 4,5 and 6 which I love to death. I thought the direction is good, I like the resolves on the end of the movie, the sound track is good, I did not mind the cast you know. Lucas Black is the lead in this movie. Sonny Chiba is in this movie I always like the actor. This was Sung Kang's first introduction of his character Han who later appeared in 4 as a cameo, than in 5 and 6 as regular cast. Vin Diesel did returned with his character Dominic Toretto, who made a cameo scene on the end of the movie, which I thought was pretty cool. Bow Wow I didn't mind him in this movie and Nathalie Kelley was extremely hot and I really though she was much better sexy babe, than Eva Mendes was in 2 Fast 2 Furious. Nathalie Kelley lights up the screen as Neela and I would welcome her return to the series any time.Overall: Tokyo Drift gets a solid 8 by me it does lacks on the great characters and the cast of the first two movies in the series, but is redeemed by Han, awesome car scenes and a pounding score from Brian Tyler. I have enjoyed this movie and I think it is a solid action movie, I love this film and it is a step above than 2 Fast 2 Furious by me.The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a 2006 American action film directed by Justin Lin, produced by Neal H. Moritz and written by Chris Morgan. It takes place between the events of sixth and seventh films.

3.0,Bad,"In this week (Sunday 20th - Sunday 27th) I will watch all Fast and Furious movies. One per day. The first one was pretty good. The second was disappointing. The third was more disappointing… ‘Fast and furious: Tokyo Drift’ is just a bad excuse to watch racing games. The first Fast and furious had a good story. It was better in many different ways. It was packed with lot of action and well played characters. If you want to watch a good and exciting movie, then don't watch this. The story is bad, the acting in the movie was bad. To put it mildly: Do not watch this movie! PS. Sorry for my English! :)",tullemis,2016-03-23,2016
4.0,Catch my drift,"Despite featuring none of the stars (but for a surprise cameo at the end) from the original films, this third instalment and its modest box office success convinced Universal Pictures that there was mileage in the Fast and Furious series.Director Justin Lin re-tooled the franchise, introduced the elements and a kinetic style that would carry on when Paul Walker and Vin Diesel return for the fourth part.Tokyo Drift has the southern drawl of Lucas Black who plays Sean Boswell a troublesome teenager regularly in trouble with the police. A disastrous drag race against a rich kid is too much for his mother who sends him to Tokyo to live with his father and attend high school there even though he does not speak a word of Japanese he apparently goes to a regular school rather than some international one.Before long Sean flirts with the girlfriend of DK (the drift king) who is the nephew of the Yakuza kingpin and falls in with the underground racing scene that features the skill of drifting.Sean starts to work for the mysterious hustler Han (Sung Kang) who teaches him how to drift and he ends up challenging DK for top dog status after a tragic accident.Although largely set in Japan the film still manages to have a multi ethnic cast and an urban soundtrack that the films have become noted for. However the story is thin, there are no outlandish heists or preposterous plotting. Lucas Black is just too blank as the lead and it is no surprise that the enigmatic Sung Kang was the more intriguing actor hence why he featured in the subsequent films.Do note that a crash scene was later retconned in the closing credits of Fast & Furious 6.The film has its flaws but it is also an important chapter in the creative team of Lin and Morgan. They would continue with the Fast & Furious films, bring back the original stars and makes this into one of the most profitable modern franchises around.",Prismark10,2016-07-07,2016
4.0,Pointless instalment in the series,"TOKYO DRIFT is the unwanted second sequel in a film franchise that seems to have absolutely zero point in existing – unless it's to get teenage boys to part with their pocket money. Each film is a stultifying excuse for flashy cars to be raced around and wrecked while attractive women in little clothing look on and cheer or boo as required. The first movie saw Vin Diesel playing a bone-headed racer in one of his worst performances; the sequel kicked him away and left wooden leading man Paul Walker to make a mess of his duties. This film does away with them both in favour of Lucas Black, a guy who I used to like when he was a child actor in '90s TV series American Gothic.Nowadays Black is all grown up and as typically handsome-but-wooden as any other actor. He seems to have lost his charisma but then all the cast of this film live in a charisma-free zone. The light story sees him packed off to Japan to curb his racing tendencies, but inevitably he runs foul of a Yakuza gang when he starts racing again. It's same old, same old, with stock supporting characters and an uninteresting cast – aside from a cameoing Sonny Chiba, still proving his worth in a fun role as a mob boss.These films are all about the races and these ones are pretty predictable. There are some interesting crashes and a few stunts here and there, but my heart wasn't really in any of them. I could enjoy the explosive chases in a film like DEATH RACE but I couldn't stop yawning as I watched the races here. They're serviceable perhaps but they're not going to set anybody's world alight. Then the film ends with a laughable twist that sets things up for yet another needless sequel. When are these guys going to give up?",Leofwine_draca,2016-07-10,2016
4.0,The dude looks 40,"If you are looking for some backup noise while you do some housework this is great for that. Other than that it's really bad. The main character is so irritating and awful, every scene he was in I couldn't help but think This dude looks 40, what the hell is he doing in a high school? He suppose to be someone who don't really care about school only cars, yet he learns perfect Japanese in a few weeks. And this is just one annoying thing, the story has so many plot holes , I stopped counting. Why is he sent to Japan in the first place, who sends criminals to live in a foreign country as a punishment? If his father is in military why don't they live in the military base? And why does the Yakusa have any interest in high school drifting? And so on.... Its just bad, yet somehow better than the first sequence because that was even worse.",nyiri-timea,2016-08-20,2016
4.0,The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift Review,"The Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift(2006) Starring: Lucas Black, Shad Moss, Nathalie Kelley, Brian Tee, Suang Kang, Brian Goodman, Sonny Chiba, Leonardo Nam, Jason Tobin, Keiko Kitagawa, Alden Villaverde, Koji Kataoka, Kevin Ryan, Lynda Boyd, and Vin Disel Directed By: Justin Lin Review On the streets of Tokyo, speed needs no translation... You know I was never big fan of the whole Fast & Furious franchise until I saw five then they made six which I did not see, and seven which I will see even though I said I wasn't going too, because I love watching films no matter what and I want to respect Paul Walker. But Fast Five will always remain as one of my favorite films of all time and my second favorite high powered car film, my first is Speed Racer. This third entry from the series is when people became curious of the franchise, it revolves around a guy who gets kicked out of America for street racing and moves in with his dad in Tokyo. When he gets there he meets a group of people who are drifters, one in particular is the Drift king. You see Han from the fifth film(snacking as usual) and he likes the kid so he teaches him how to drift. Han is also stealing money from the Drift king and he wants to take down and his new prodigy with speed in the fast lane. The film wasn't all that fun which is what these movies are meant to be, their meant to be fun action movies . But the only fun out of this film like the first two is the street racing. That's it. Not any fights, not any characters, not even any shoot outs. This film just lacked the amount of fun you would want in an action film. The performances in this film are as bland as butter, the only one who seemed to be trying where Suang Kang and Brian Tee they were the only ones I bought in this movie. Everyone else is just bland or terrible. Don't even get me started on Bow Wow, the credit shows him as Shad Moss being the actors name but my TV said Bow Wow so I think LetterBox is wrong on that. But yeah he was the worst thing about this movie. The Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift does have cool car sequences but also a watered down and uninteresting plot, bad acting and characters you can't get into, I'm giving this drifter a two out of five.",Spideyfan-963-246215,2016-09-08,2016
1.0,Forgettable,"How can I describe The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift in one word? I would have to say ""forgettable."" I'm a huge fan of the Fast and the Furious movies. I think they're awesome. I watched Tokyo Drift once on TV. I wasn't impressed. After having loved The Fast and the Furious and 2 Fast 2 Furious, I hated Tokyo Drift. After that, I really had no interest to see Tokyo Drift again. But I saw it a second time only because I was hanging out with friends and one of the guys turned it on. I didn't leave. I watched it and decided to see if it would be better a second time around. The opening to Tokyo Drift really wasn't anything special. The race was nothing great. Especially when you compare it to the first impressive race they had to start off 2 Fast 2 Furious. The protagonist we are introduced to is Sean Boswell, but there is really no immediate reason to really like him. I also guessed from the beginning of the movie that the soundtrack was going to be terrible. And oh boy was I right. This movie had one of the lamest soundtracks ever. The storyline to the movie isn't really that original or interesting. It's basically Karate Kid and Karate Kid Part II, only with racing. The writers were clearly inspired by those movies instead of the previous Fast and the Furious movies when they wrote this. There's the new guy moving to a new place and starting at a new school. He meets a girl he likes, the girl has a mean boyfriend. The mean boyfriend and main villain of the movie is D.K. D.K is a cross between Johnny Lawrence from Karate Kid and Chozen from Karate Kid Part II. Only unlike Johnny, instead of kicking the protagonist's ass and humiliating him with karate, D.K. does it in a race. Sean, our very dull hero, realizes that racing in Tokyo is a hell of a lot different. It's a different kind of racing called drifting. He is taken under someone's wing and trains. D.K., like Chozen, gives our hero a beating, gets dishonored in the movie, and even has a powerful uncle that he respects and fears. There was one interesting idea in the whole movie and that was the new way of racing. They decided to try something new with the drifting. Personally, I prefer the good old street racing from The Fast and the Furious and 2 Fast 2 Furious. But hey, they wanted to try something new with Tokyo Drift. Unfortunately, the other new things just didn't cut it. The cast of Tokyo Drift was nowhere near as good as the solid casts they had in the other Fast and the Furious movies. The villain in Tokyo Drift is a weak villain, the love interest, Nathalie Kelley was nothing special, Sung Kang was nothing special, and Bow Wow just wasn't a good casting choice. Seriously, Bow Wow? Finally, I have to get to the star of the movie, Lucas Black. Lucas Black couldn't top Paul Walker or Vin Diesel. I didn't think he was going to. How could anyone? But he was just a terrible leading man. He was dull and boring and had zero charisma. Paul Walker and Vin Diesel are certainly not dull or boring. And they both have charisma. They were able to use that charisma to make you cheer them on and root for them as you watched the movie. I don't know what they were thinking when they cast Lucas Black to play the hero. I saw this movie twice and both times were out of curiosity. The first time, I wondered what it was. The second time, I wondered if I'd like it more. The movie didn't come through. To all of you Fast and the Furious fans out there that absolutely love this franchise, skip Tokyo drift and go straight to Fast and Furious. It featured Paul Walker and Vin Diesel and that was the way it started and should have stayed. Okay, 2 Fast 2 Furious didn't have Vin Diesel. But Paul Walker did great carrying the movie and Tyrese was just fine. Tokyo Drift had no one to carry the movie or save the movie. Seeing the Fast and the Furious movies that followed Tokyo Drift only make you realize more how bad Tokyo Drift really was. If you decided to start a Fast and the Furious collection, great. But I'd leave Tokyo Drift out and focus on the other movies that have everything you could want in a movie. We definitely could have done without Tokyo Drift. It's a shame they decided to tie it in to the rest of the movies because it was unnecessary. We also could've done without Sun Kang's character Han. And just in case you're wondering, Lucas Black wasn't used for the rest of the movies. He only showed up once and for a minute in Furious 7 to help tie in Tokyo Drift. The dull Lucas Black and his character are, like Tokyo Drift, forgettable.",mercury4,2016-09-19,2016
7.0,It's All Drifting,"OK Now I'm on Tokyo Drift .... Let's see, What I like about TD is the introduction of H A N Z. I love him in this installment with his fine self. I love his calm cool demeanor and those eyes. Yes those eyes ... He came in and played himself it's not like he took on the role of any of the other characters but then again I guess that may have been part of being allowed to use the franchise name and continue to push out installments. Just in case the originals ever got on the same page and in agreement to all come back and do another installment. But this installment I like because of the ""drifting"". It was a fresh and new at the time and I thought it was some of the better drifting I'd ever seen had me wishing I could do that and wanting to move to Tokyo ....I'm such a big kid, I know LOL. I don't think Bow Wow brought anything to the line up or the franchise. He was like a Luda type character. All the while I'm sitting here typing this review I'm watching TD and other than the drifting and Hanz, it was not as good as I remember.",hersheedontplay,2016-11-24,2016
6.0,Far better than the previous two,"Well, it is rather odd that IMDb is labeling this movie as a romance because I would hardly say that it is a romance beyond any other action movie that has a romantic element in it (and there are very few action movies that don't have a romantic element in them, but just because boy gets girl doesn't make the movie a romance). Anyway, what surprised me about this film is that there was no connection between this film and the last two (with the exception of a Vin Diesal cameo), and further more it didn't follow the lines of an undercover cop come drag racer infiltrating an illegal drag racing ring. In fact this film is probably more what the first film should have been as opposed to what it turned out as (though we should note that this film is set in Japan as opposed to the United States so there are some cultural differences that are relevant).So what we have in this film is the story of a rebel, Sean, who get his first speeding ticket the day after he got his driver's license, and is a bit of a loner namely because his carefree attitude means that his mother has to keep on moving. Anyway he lands up in another drag race which results in the destruction of two cars and a housing estate, and since the other participants have really rich parents he is the one who has to take the rap. So, he is sent to Japan to live with his father. The problem is that this is the type of guy that always seems to find trouble, and since he is a gaijin (non-Japanese), he ends up hanging with the other gaijin, and gets involved with illegal street racing there as well. The thing is that racing in Japan is vastly different from racing in the United States. Whereas in the US you have flat surfaces and long straight roads, you don't have that in Japan. As such racing here involves going up and down carparking lots and mountains in a form of racing called 'drifting'. Basically drifting involves navigating tight turns at high speeds without causing damage to the car, and winning the race. This is something Sean doesn't realise when he lands up in this new world – the rules of racing back in the United States – the 10 second race – don't apply here. In a way this film is similar to the other films, but different, and a part of me feels that this addition to the franchise kicked it off to the extent that it is now up to film number seven, though the rumour was that the actors in the previous films were not too keen on coming back and that this was going to be a reboot. However, what impressed me was that the story was completely different, though I would hardly call it original. In a sense it is one of those fish out of water stories, the story of a guy that simply wants to belong but has a lot of trouble doing so. We see this at the beginning of the film where we seems to wander around without any real friends. Obviously this changes once he gets to Japan since being different he is able to attract others who are different as well. Mind you, the one criticism that I do have of the film is that Sean clearly knows no Japanese so it makes me wonder how it is that he is going to learn anything in a Japanese school (and it was pretty clear that they taught in Japanese). Also, isn't it interesting that they always go after the girl that they can't have, and eventually get her. It doesn't really send a strong message to our impressionable youth. Mind you, the fact that the two protagonists in this film refer to women as 'their girls' doesn't do much in the way of dismantling the objectification of women, and further that one of the girls puts herself forward as the prize for the winner of the race is even worse. No wonder Hillary lost.",The-Sarkologist,2016-12-02,2016
6.0,"The Worst Of ""TFATF"" Movies, But Still Worth Watching","The third movie in the ‘Fast And The Furious’ movies — but chronologically takes place much later in the series — has a teenager (played by Lucas Black) sent to school in Tokyo because he's been a naughty boy in America and his illegal racing activities will get him sent to prison unless he goes to another country to live with his father. Huh? What? Hey, never mind this isn't a movie about logic and realism. Anyway Black is now in Tokyo, gets the hots for a classmate who is dating a gangster (played by Brian Tee), and is introduced to drifting (a controlled, sideways movement of a fast moving car). Ah! ‘Tokyo Drift’ you say with a big grin. Not wanting to look like a punk who can't drive, Black is taken under the wing of ‘TFATF’ alumni Han (played by Sung Kang) to be taught how to drift so Black can settle all his problems by racing and drifting. Makes sense? No? Well, it's not supposed to! This movie is for people who like to drive fast cars and want to see crazy, fast driving in the movies. I'm one of those people, but I also appreciate a well-written story. Oh, well, at least I get half of what I want. My most memorable, movie moment of ‘The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift’ is the scene when **SPOILER ALERT** Kang is being chased by Tee, and Kang's car flips over and explodes, killing Kang. Why is this so memorable to me? Because the Han character played by Kang is my favorite in all of ‘TFATF’ movies. Although ‘Tokyo Drift’ is my least favorite movie of this series, it still ties in to the storyline, especially to the later movies, so it's a must see for ‘TFATF’ fans.

5.0,A Different Type of Street Racing,"Constantly in trouble due to illegal racing, a high school senior named ""Sean Boswell"" (Lucas Black) is sent to live with his father who is in the military and stationed in Japan. When he gets there he immediately gravitates to a group of other students his age who are also involved in racing fast cars. However, because of the limited space in Tokyo the sport has changed to one that involves negotiating extremely tight corners in either an underground parking garage or a narrow road along the side of a mountain. The problem Sean has is not only that he is not used to this type of racing-known as drift racing--but also that his main rival is an arrogant punk named ""Takashi"" (Brian Tee) who is extremely jealous whenever his girlfriend, ""Neela"" (Nathalie Kelley) even looks at another guy. And there is some definite chemistry between her and Sean. It also doesn't help that Takashi thinks he can do whatever he wants because his uncle, ""Kamata"" (Sonny Chiba) is a high-ranking member of the Yakuza. One other problem is that Takashi is also extremely good at drift racing. In any case, with all of these areas of disagreement it is only a matter of time before Sean and Takashi have it out and when they do the stakes will be very high. Now, rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie certainly had some good moments here and there. Unfortunately, there were some scenes which were a little over-the-top and which caused the film to seem a bit uneven. That being the case, I rate this movie as about average and recommend it only to those who might enjoy a film of this type.",Uriah43,2017-01-15,2017
5.0,Drifting Into Franchise Turmoil,"It's been well documented how the F&F franchise was pretty much garbage before The Rock came on to the series, and Tokyo Drift is more of the same. I had never sat through the entire runtime until now, and just as I thought, it's definitely not one of the better ones.In fact, Tokyo Drift is the second worst of the series, just in front of its predecessor, 2 Fast 2 Furious. This installment takes the series abroad, as we watch Sean Boswell played by Lucas Black, get brought back into the dangerous game of street racing and become acquainted with the technique of drifting. Boswell is supposed to be a teenager who gets sent away to live with his father in Tokyo after getting into trouble one too many times back home in Arizona. Black doesn't look young enough to be in high school, nor do I really see the need for the writers to make him in high school. Why not just make him a high school drop-out, a few years removed from a structured life, and someone looking for a place to call home. Perhaps, even refer to him as a constant ""drifter"". Poor Pun? Probably.With no sign of Paul Walker or Vin Diesel, Tokyo Drift is forced to carry on with actors who are better off served in supporting roles. Surprisingly, there isn't that one character or performance that's distractingly over-the-top like in the previous two adventures. At the same time, there's nothing all that special about any of the characters to begin with. There's certainly more of an attempt to add depth to the characters, with both the protagonist and antagonist having some serious family issues, but it's not fleshed out in an interesting way. Instead, most of it is addressed in a disappointingly cliché manner.You can tell there's something refreshing about Justin Lin's direction. He isn't repeating the same beats as the first two films in the same way that 2 Fast 2 Furious did. The decision to take it outside America and bring new cars and new characters was probably the correct choice, but it could have handled better. In the same vein, the lack of creativity in the plot is puzzling. Introducing an antagonistic uncle to Takashi who I think runs some sort of shady business was unnecessary. Not only did they refuse to really address the nature of his work but I'm not sure he added anything of value to the story, at all.Does it matter that the second and third F&F movies are poor? Not really. With where the series is now, it doesn't really matter to me that the first few films struggled to find the right tone. What's important is that they have found the right speed now. See what I did there?+New locations, cars, and action-Characters are as generic as they come-Weak villain5.4/10",ThomasDrufke,2017-04-09,2017
8.0,"No rats in buckets, no CGI, just an entertaining flick featuring excellent car racing","Branching away from any original cast members of the first two films, thankfully, Tokyo Drift provides a refreshingly new look to the franchise.Tokyo Drift is possibly my favourite of the series, or at least its up there with the first film; it only has a few problems that can be swept under the ""It's Fast and the Furious, what do you expect"" carpet. The story follows American ""teenager"" Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) whose reckless driving lands him prison time, but to avoid this he moves in with his father in Tokyo. He attempts to move on a dangerous rival's girl, and must become a competitor in the street racing's drifting scene.I say ""teenager"" as that's what IMDb says, and he does go to school in the movie but honestly, he's the oldest teen I've ever seen. Along with every other ""teen"" in this movie! While I talk negatives, the majority of the film is set in Tokyo yet 95% of the dialogue is English and Sean has a knack of meeting every foreigner in the city. I don't mind this so much, but I fully expect all of the Japanese characters to speak Japanese, especially when Sean isn't present!But, unlike 2 Fast 2 Furious (choke) this film actually cares for its characters and their personalities (as Sean says early on: ""It's not about the ride, it's about the rider"") from Sean's fish-out-of- water acceptance, to his mentor Han's closet of skeletons. The villain isn't ridiculous either, his uncle is part of the Yakuza and he has a serious ""king of a little hill"" problem. Again unlike 2 Fast 2 Furious (gag) the cars have never looked better, sleek and refined and the drifting action is spectacular, especially when synchronized. Plus, no CGI, just skilled professional drivers, making the film worth seeing solely for the racing.There's no stupid Tyrese Gibson mugging at the camera, no rats in buckets, no CGI, just an entertaining (albeit poorly localized) flick featuring excellent car racing and professional stunts.",CinemaCocoa,2017-04-12,2017
4.0,The weakest of the F&F series,"The third installment in what was once the Fast and the Furious trilogy was a near total reboot with new characters and a new location. Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) is a troubled teen whose mother ship's him out to live with his military father in Tokyo. He encounters Twinkie (Bow Wow) who introduces him to the underground street racing culture of Tokyo. He flirts with Neela (Nathalie Kelley) and is challenged to a race by D.K. (Brian Tee). Loaned a car by Han (Sung Kang), Sean is introduced to drifting and the complication of trying to make the tight turns of this Japanese racing style. He destroys the car, loses the girl, and finds himself in debt to Han. Forced to carry out chores for Han, Sean makes a deal where he can learn how to drift as he familiarized himself with the underworld of Tokyo. Han takes him under his wing but there is trouble brewing with D.K.'s illegal business. With the help of Twinkie, Sean practices the art of drifting and attends his Japanese high school. The bully Morimoto (Leonardo Nam) is part of D.K.'s crew and beats up Twinkie before Sean steps in to stop him. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",swilliky,2017-04-13,2017
5.0,Change Of Pace Doesn't Seem Too Fresh,"First,the good,the cameos,they may seem unimportant,but they're very cool and honor the past.The racing,it is a bit different,and I like how there is a lot more practical stunts than CGI.I liked that the races were part of the plot,and even though it wasn't the best,the plot did flow nicely.Some characters,like Han and Twinkie(yes that's his name)were decently acted and entertaining.The main character had a few good scenes as well.The best part is the new setting of Tokyo,it is very different and the movie does a good job of exploring the racing culture.Now,the bad,the characters,they aren't nearly as memorable as the originals,and aren't acted the best.The main character is pretty wooden,and the villain had a weak motivation and wasn't that threatening or entertaining,he was just an asshole.The action,it all feels the same,but it's still pretty good.The movie mainly suffers from being unmemorable.All in all,Tokyo Drift has good racing scenes and a nice setting,but it also has weak characters and isn't the most memorable,it probably should've been a direct to DVD movie.",jordansepticeye,2017-04-17,2017
6.0,the 3rd one is so much better then the 1st.,I did not like The fast and the furious. But I like this movie. 2 fast and 2 furies is better. Fast and furious new model original parts is also better. Fast five is also better. Fast and Furious 6 is also better. Furious 7 is also better. But still this movie has a great story line. It also has great acting. See it. It is one of the best action movies from 2006. This is a lot better then V for vendetta that movie stinks. But this movie is so mush better. It is very fast past. See this movie. It is a great movie. You need to see this movie. If you like action movies you like this movie. I is awesome. See it. It is a great movie. A lot of action. You need to see it. It is awesome.,jacobjohntaylor1,2017-04-18,2017
10.0,This was the ONE movie of the franchise connecting all others,"*** This review may contain spoilers *** When I first heard about Tokyo Drift and realized that it would feature none of the original cast members, I was hesitant to see it. Can you imagine what a risk the producers took to make this one? At that time we did not know it was the ONE movie of the franchise connecting all others with one of its major characters. Sung demonstrated a lot of talent, making his heartbroken character believable. We see his emotions throughout the movie and we want to know what happened to him, to understand him a little better. After watching Fast 6 come back and see this one. It will all add up. I've seen so many reviews saying that character development was too hurried, for those saying that I only want to say this: Have you watched all the movies???? It annoys me so much seeing people review without knowing what these movies are about. Tokyo Drift takes place after 6, which shows how much effort the writers and producers put into this franchise. It was all written way back. To have that imagination is effing amazing. When I first saw Tokyo Drift, I could not see what it had to do with The Fast and Furious series. I got mad. I just couldn't get it. Funny thing is that the character I loved the most was HAN. My brain was blow away when I saw the other movies. I was like ‘What's happening? Isn't he dead?’ ‘What? How? When?’ So you can imagine that after knowing he's going to die seeing the relationship developing with Gisele was killing me. Now I could see why he wasn't giving a s**t. Like, he was the coolest out there without showing it. Why wasn't he claiming his spot? Because he lost everything that really mattered to him. Ride or die, remember? What a way to blow our minds. You killed it with the whole plot dear writers. I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF THE 8 MOVIES launched so far. And yes, I will be a die hard fan of this franchise even when I'm 50. Thank you Sung Kang and Gal Gadot for giving me one of my favorite on screen couples with just a few scenes.",andrbdeea,2017-04-20,2017
4.0,The black sheep of the fast and furious franchise,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift was prime evidence that the franchise desperately needed a makeover. Not only did it dispose of its popular protagonist in exchange for a cheap lookalike, but also, aside from a couple cool race scenes, it's really just a huge mess. The plot simply advances because the writers need it to, there aren't any real substantial plot elements that keep the audience involved. The story itself seems just like a rehash of any classic gang feud film, and it comes as no surprise to me that the franchise was turned towards high-octane heist films. That transition was definitely for the better, because this formula quickly ran thin.Not even a quick appearance from Vin Diesel could save this film, as his appearance only served to up audience ratings before its release. It may seem like a cool little nod to the previous films, but it doesn't make me care about this new character any more than I already didn't. The film's look is extremely dated, even for 2006. It felt like a real step back from 2 Fast 2 Furious, rather than a revolutionization of the series. I wouldn't have minded Paul Walker's absence if these characters could have held their own, but sadly they just fall flat before the story can even pick up steam.This is probably my least favorite entry in the franchise, and not because Paul Walker wasn't in it. While his absence didn't help matters, the story as a whole felt very uneven and didn't flow through very well. It was pretty unbelievable at times as well, not because of the stunts, but because of the plot itself. Certain things happen just for the sake of happening, with no real substance or process shown in between. It's too convenient to be a good film, despite the stylish driving tactics. Drifting car races are the highlights of the film, but everything in between is just too pointless and shallow to make this a good film. It's a mediocre at best effort, and the weakest entry in the franchise.",ryanskywalker-87402,2017-04-21,2017
4.0,"Only worth watching as part of the full ""F&F"" series, and after 6","In 2006, ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" undoubtedly deserved to be panned by critics. The series had fallen so far off the course that only its ugliest, most formulaic bits stayed alive. It's only as part of the franchise that was revived three years later and has gone on to become a billion-dollar enterprise that ""Tokyo Drift"" reclaims some sense of its dignity.Let's get the good out of the way. ""Tokyo Drift"" was a vital proving ground for director Justin Lin, who would go on to make the next three ""Fast & Furious"" movies. His work on this entry was too good for the material, frankly. His shot variety and the editing team give the film a legitimate action feel that the first two films don't even come close to touching. As much as the film overloads on race sequences, Lin nails them.As for why screenwriter Chris Morgan got the long-term gig for this franchise after his work on this film, consider me stumped. The story of Alabama teenager Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) shipping off to Tokyo, discovering the drift racing scene and burrowing his way into the innermost circle is ambitiously preposterous.Obviously the plot of the ""Fast & Furious"" movies is known to be second fiddle to a handful of other components, but this particular plot has some problems as far as race – and unfortunately not the car kind of race, but the people kind. In a nutshell, the story of ""Tokyo Drift"" is misunderstood troubled white teenager flees the consequences of his actions to Tokyo where his dad lives, defies his father's wishes, asserts himself into a racing gang, stands up to the cocky Japanese ""Drift King"" (Brian Tee), tries to steal the man's girlfriend (Nathalie Kelley), earns the trust of his partner (Sung Kang) and ultimately aims to prove he's better than him. Only one of the five major characters in this movie is actually Japanese, and it's the bad guy. The movie is very interested in appropriating Japanese culture and aesthetics for its mostly non- Japanese cast. For starters you have Black, who looks like he's in his thirties and is playing a teenager. Boswell is also written to have the same personality and temperament as Paul Walker's O'Conner, so he's essentially a stand-in/replacement. As for Boswell's first friend, he's of course played by a black rap star (Shad Moss a.k.a. ""Bow Wow"") and the girl he's after? She's an ethnic Australian. Tee's D.K. is painted as the bully, so he doesn't stand as much of an exception. Only Kang's character Han has dimension beyond stereotype, but Kang is a Korean-American actor. The producers' foresight to bring the Han character into future ""Fast & Furious"" films and paint ""Tokyo Drift"" as taking place after the sixth movie was surprisingly astute. When viewed after the next three films instead of before, Han becomes more than just the most interesting character in the movie, but the character we're most interested in given his character arc in those other films. It also makes the movie's surprising cameo at the end make a lot of sense. All this to say, ""Tokyo Drift"" might be garbage as a standalone movie, but given what the franchise has become, Morgan used future movies to position what once seemed like an accident/stop-gap film into being a spin-off. In other words, if you're going to put yourself through ""Tokyo Drift,"" do it after watching the fourth, fifth and sixth ""Fast & Furious"" movies. Lin's style does give ""Tokyo Drift"" some additional value, but for most people it won't be enough to watch it under any other circumstance but as part of the series.~Steven CThanks for reading!

6.0,It's passable but not as good as the first: Would Recommend,"Directed by Justin LinStarring Lucas Black, Natallie Kelley and Sung KangPlot Overview: ​Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) always feels like an outsider, but he defines himself through his victories as a street racer. His hobby makes him unpopular with the authorities, so he goes to live with his father in Japan. Once there and even more alienated, he learns about an exciting, but dangerous, new style of the sport. The stakes are high when Sean takes on the local champion and falls for the man's girlfriend.After two very successful movie(commercially not critically), Justin Lin had a tough time trying to continue the franchise with none of the original cast members in it and I respect how good this movie is in spite of that. That doesn't make the movie 'good' however. It's a perfectly passable movie that I can see myself watching maybe every once and a while but it lacks a certain intrigue the first one contained and a neat charm the second possessed. The transition of directors in a franchise can be difficult and I understand that. I will also admit that it's better than '2 Fast 2 Furious' but that doesn't make it a very good movie. I imagine you will be entertained, and it is definitely for fans of the street racing aspects of these movies but I can't really say you'll be blown away by anything in this movie.The story isn't generally the thing you focus upon in these movies but if you do genuinely care then you'll be satisfied. It's a more grounded, race driven story that is very centered around one specific thing and sticks to that thing throughout the entire movie. The ending is actually pretty decent and I like how they stitch the franchise together.It's honestly quite hard to be the worst actor in a franchise that included Vin Disel but Lucas Black steals the only thing Disel had going for him in this franchise. I get he had no professional training but then in that case he shouldn't even be there if he possesses no ability to act. Sean's backstory isn't that interesting and he possesses no traits that make him a genuinely enticing character. Nattalie Kelley was also pretty poor as Neela and her character was pretty irrelevant. Sung Kang was good as Han and is this movies main saving grace. He's cool but you don't know WHY he is cool and that is really interesting. Bow Wow was meh as Twinkie but I can see the reason he hasn't been featured in any more movies up until this point. Brian Tee was also really weak as DK and wasn't a very good villain at all either. Brian Goodman was fine as Major Boswell.From a technical standpoint, the movie is fine. The cinematography was mostly fine and the actual race sequences were handled infinitely better than in the first two. Costume design was fine but the Set Design was really cheap, lazy and not natural.The actual action in this movie is extremely weak and the set pieces are awful. I get that wasn't the primary concern of this movie but that doesn't excuse it being weak. It is more enjoyable than '2 Fast 2 Furious' but inferior to 'The Fast and the Furious'.In conclusion, this movie is fine. It is a perfectly passable, average sequel that exists for the sake of existing. It is better than it's predecessor but inferior to the original. There is some enjoyment value to be had and I do sort of recommend it but I am blown away this movie was as successful as it was.6/10Would Recommend",EthanBJones_03,2017-05-09,2017
1.0,The neurons escape 2 fast,"Infumible garbage, a full-blown torture and a shame in every scene. The third part of this franchise is one of the worst movies you can suffer. Do you know those simple stories of embarrassing script that were the previous ?, because this is not even simple. There is no story, there is nothing.The thing can be tried to explain in this: a Lucas Black trying to sneak as a 17-year-old boy, gets trouble in car races. Instead of going to the jail or the juvie, he goes to Japan, where his father lives, and in their class they're all in the races, where you give him a car because he has the money, and when he breaks it, he gives him another one. There are more races and another guy who also has money left gives him wads of bills to continue trying to kill himself. His biggest rival is another kid with fantasies of greatness who, well, likes the same girl as him. All this dense and intelligent plot will settle with a race in which the winner takes the girl as a trophy. Is the same history of ""Karate Kid 2"" 20 years after (KK2 was in 1986), this time with tuned cars.And that's it, that's all. Really, there's nothing else, that's the movie. It is even surprising that you can make good the previous two.The races ?, can not be described as action scenes, are over the top of a higher level, with cars making impossible drifts thanks to a sultry CGI.What's the moral? For men: don't study, don't be smart, don't strive, don't work, life will give you everything done, money will rain from the sky, you will always be surrounded by good girls, drinking champagne for the day while playing Ludo with the baddies of your friends, and destroying $ 20000 cars up in the evenings. For women: don't study, don't be smart, don't strive, don't work, just go to the prototype man described above, you can always be the trophy with which will remain the most pouch of all; a good girl who pleases the macho men.Vomiting.",stormhawk2021,2017-07-13,2017
6.0,"It's okay, but far from great.","If it wasn't for this movie being incorporated into the franchises overall story I think I might be less enthusiastic about it. Because other than the character of Han and a few good races there's not a lot I like about Tokyo Drift. Sure it's easy to just say this movie sucks because it lacks most of are favorite characters, and I'd be hard-pressed to disagree with that. But even this movies story is kinda lame. I know people praise this movie for really giving you a feel for the culture, but I'm not a car guy so that doesn't really matter to me.What matters to me when I watch a F&F movie is great, exciting action/racing scenes and a half decent story. I know it's F&F so asking for an elaborate story is comical to say the least. But Tokyo Drifts story is really hindered by that fact that 90% of the characters are in high school. So the result is a movie that feels smaller than the ones that came before it, and with far less stakes for it's characters than the ones that come after it. All in all if you stack it up against some of the others it doesn't compare, but as a standalone movie it's alright.",joshua-c-s-1996,2018-03-03,2018

8.0,Gets Better with years.,"As a child, i do remember, seeing my friends and spending the whole afternoon watching this film. Everytime. I'm in love with the franchise, but especially, i'm in love with Tokyo Drift. First of all, the soundtrack. 
One, simple word. Amazing. From the first scene to the last. Still singing ""My Life be Like Ooh Aaah"" one decade after. The ""Barracuda"" song, also. The one that spells the word ""Barracuda"". Awesome. And of course the song in the parking lot, ""Fast And Furious"". The famous one. Then, the characters. 
Characters are well written. Of course they are full of clichès. It must be. It's a fast and furious one. Nathalie Kelly looks like a dream. Lucas Black is also a great main character. Bow Wow, he makes me laugh. And Sung Kang, the one playing Han, he's the real hero. So cool. James Dean of the franchise. You can easily fall in love with every character. Even the bad guys are cool. And, last but not least. The Cars. 
Changing to one driving style to another. To let the franchise fresh. Good choice. But then. Cars are so hot in this movie. From first till last race. I'm in love with drift cars. With the red Lancer, the Slylines and of course with Han's RX7. Amazing. If own a car, or a motorbike, and you love it. Well that's the movie for you. Definitely. I'm huge a fan. So this is gonna be a huge 8. Please, do not kill the franchise, ever.",yepp-922-27352,2018-09-08,2018

5.0,An Average By The Numbers Action Movie,"24 October 2006. This movie did what it was designed to do - show of fast cars and a little bit of female legs for the young men going to see this movie and make a little profit for the producers. This predictable movie without much more provided the typical thrills and melodrama that any tame male macho movie is supposed to, except for its more exotic locale - Tokyo - which is used to a degree. While the plot is mostly straight forward and the action decent, there isn't much else, except for a small attempt at avoiding a fight scene and a weak attempt to introduce Japanese culture to the American movie scene or vice versa. The chase scene that includes lots of drifting unfortunately was handled in the most obviously set up way with cars set up in patterned, artificial ways so that safety came first (while essential) really made the movie look cheap. The character development of course was flat, the relationships nothing special, the integration of Japanese culture only mild - not much new or learned here. Just a fast-paced, not even that sexy, a movie that at least held together decently. Five out of Ten Stars.",tabuno,2019-01-21,2019
1.0,"I never thought It was going to get a worse than ""2 Fast 2 Furious"".","But from the start, it set off things with one of the worst casting ever. All the characters look super old, not even close to teenagers. Besides that, the acting and dialogue is even worse than before. Was this on purpose to make Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson look like better actors?First scene: a woman just offers herself up as a prize for a race between her boyfriend and our protagonist. Excuse me? ""I thought you loved me"", she says when the race is about the finish and it is close. WHAT?After that pathetic start, nothing gets better, which is really a hard thing to do. The plot is stupid, as the poorly presented ""troublemaker teen"" is sent to Japan with his father... only to remain the same and fall for a ""girl that he can't have"". That's it. That's the story. There are idiotic actions and reactions, that ends up involving Yakuzas(!) and cars, to the fact he likes a girl (and she likes him back for no reason other than he's a white American in Japan. Apparently the producers didn't realize Black is not Paul Walker), but they don't really add anything interesting.Absolutely atrocious.",educallejero,2019-03-24,2019
1.0,Watched it for the lol,"I could not possibly take this movie serious. I watched all the previous parts and pained my way through it. First there was this slightly to OLD main character Sean from high School. It started of course with a race. But the Price was this blonde Girl. She even set herself out as a Price. I mean common, I didnt´t know this franchise could go any lower in objectifying women. But here they went. The first race was really neckbraking and Sean even drove through a construction building. When the Guy and the Girl crashed - I thought they must be dead. But they only had scratches. At the Police Station, the cop said Sean would go to prison. Which I fullhearted Support! When they said he allready had a full Register with illegal car races and nothing happened to him, it made me so angry... I couldn't like the main character. I am glad the mother kicked him out. Of course, the first Thing you think of to give your son a lesson for live: Send him to Japan for correction. There he lived with his dad who tried to give him some boundarys and threatens him with consequences. Next day he already went to School. Just like that.. in Tokio.. and he doesn't speak one word japanese. The first Thing in class was of course the non-japanese love interesst in the movie. Also he met some African american bloke who oppenly tried to sell him stolen goods. I thought (or wished) it would be a film about integrity, but no - It looked so american I could only guess they filmed it in a japanese area somewhere in a bigger City in the US. I dunno Sean soon discovered he could start racing again in Japan. Although his father would kick him out as promissed. Sean didn't care. And Oh - look, of course his new Girl was the GF from his racing Opponent. And more to come: As he doesn't have a care. Some RANDOM bloke said: here take mine. Although I don't know you and your skills, please, take my expensive racing car. Of course he shattered the car in pieces... and we find out the car owner belongs to yakuza. I have to addmit I drifted of to sleep by myself very often. They had a lot of races in between, but: the never drove like.. straight through the streets. They always drifted. I got it in the parking house... but why would they do that on a straight street? Eventually someone actually died in a race. They Kind of didn't mourn or took a lesson out of it. NO! Sean got in a hassle with some yakuza Boss who surely would just shot him down, but Sean asked for forgivness by driving a race and everything would be forgotten? Stupidest Thing I have ever heard. And they did so! Another race was coming and in the end, the Opponent DK (Donky Kong I thought first) crashed horribly and could have been dead. I hoped for the movie: Sean gets a grip, Ends the race early and Looks after DK if he is alright. No, he doenst. Driving straight to the Yakuza Boss who nods and no lesson was learned that day. It taught the audience, driving riskfull, even getting People killed, is ok. There will be no punishment. Women will like you even more. You also don't have to study or work. You just get new cars. Women offer themselve willingly to even the biggest brats but if you got enough horsepower.",lythis-love,2019-04-19,2019

9.0,Underated Movies in the series - definitely one of the better ones.,"This movie seems to be one of those that people either love or hate. On the one hand, its very different to the other movies, and a lot of people dislike it.
But some of the rankings for the whole series put this in second place.The advantage Tokyo Drift has is, at its core, its a story about a boy in trouble, in a foreign place, and with little support from family.
There's not machine guns or CGI or unbelievable stunts. There's not the Rock or Vin Deisel. It's fairly realistic, and the setting in Tokyo is superb.
The main actor plays it understated, and none of the over the top charactatures we see in the other movies.

There weren't any HUGE glaring inaccuracies (other than daddy throwing sonny the keys to a car with NO ENGINE in it...) The three cameos in the film were well placed, though a bit campy at the very end.

7.0,This franchise drifts back into fun,"After an entertaining first movie and nearly unwatchable second, Tokyo Drift brings this franchise back into the positive with an absolutely refreshingly fun and unique twist on the formula. Set almost entirely in Japan, which is notorious for winding mountain roads perfect for drifting (as seen in Initial-D, which is recommended if you liked this, both the movie and the anime), this movie brings back the cars and action sorely underutilized in the second movie and spices things up with a bit of Japanese culture and swanky mid-race camera tricks.Tokyo Drift won't be winning any awards for acting; the acting here is cheesy and oftentimes teeters on bad, particularly when it comes to Neela (played by Nathalie Kelley, who switches accents from scene to scene and seems to think she's in a Disney channel show). But that's not why we're here, is it? I didn't expect a masterpiece of acting when I watched this so I won't knock the movie for it. What I will say was disappointing was the focus on American characters in Japan (for what it's worth, I am American myself). Initially, I didn't know the main character of Tokyo Drift was an American, though as the movie played out I accepted it since it's genuinely entertaining to watch an Alabama boy try to assimilate into Japanese culture. But quite a few main characters weren't Japanese, including Neela and Twinkie. For being set in Japan, I was hoping for more Japanese characters. Han was awesome and quickly rose to be my favorite character of the franchise yet. While I won't spoil anything here, the choices made for Han's character disappointed me greatly, though I have to give the film credit for actually *going* there.Overall, I found this the most entertaining film in the Fast and the Furious franchise yet. While I know the films branch out from here, I only wish for more racing/drifting films set in Japan because it's stuff like this I can't get enough of. The climax race of this film (American muscle versus Japanese drift) was an absolute thrill. More like this, please!",fewald139,2019-08-25,2019

5.0,"An honest, real review","I'm gonna be Real Honest here.
Love fast and furious movies,they're fun to watch, so was watching them all again, and can't help myself now but have to comment on this movie because it is sooooooooooooooo annoying thinking about the fact someone, or more than one person, actually got paid for the casting in this movie!?Nothing personal against Lucas Black, not saying he's a bad actor, but what kind of mentally challenged guy or team of people thought he was the right fit to play a 17yo troubled teen in this movie????I mean seriously?? Whoever payed anyone to do the casting for this movie, call me next time in stead to cast ur movie and I will do a million times better for free...Picking a 35year old looking guy to play a 17yo kid (with a terrible southern accent)... It blows my mind... Again, not judging Lucas Black, if someone would pay me a lot of money to play a 15yo girl in a movie once, fk it, I will do it too.But I'm a 34yo man, I am not right to play that part! I'm writing this review in the middle of watching the movie, and going to finish watching it now.But will still be so annoyed the whole movie long watching some 35yo looking dude struggling to act like a 17yo kid...Really worst casting ever, they might as well had anthony hopkins play the main charachter, would've been just as believable.",davidplees,2019-09-15,2019

8.0,Best of the Series. Fight Me.,"This movie is crazy fun. Justin Lin is a perfect fit for this franchise, and the way he shoots the drifting scenes gives us maybe the best-looking car action in the whole franchise. Best of all, it gives us the coolest character in the franchise: Han. He single-handedly expands the way the series treats the role of the ""alpha male"", something if Hobbs and Shaw is much too insecure and stupid to tackle or understand.",matthewssilverhammer,2019-11-04,2019
3.0,Stylistically excellent; Otherwise atrocious,"I watched this 2006 movie in 2009, in advance of the fourth installment coming out. I found it extremely poor and I want to let you know why. 1. It's not a ‘The Fast and the Furious’ movie. The first two installments established the franchise as involving illegal streetracing, organized crime, and undercover law enforcement. This movie is about a high school outsider who proves himself, finds his place, and gets the girl (a plot in which streetracing is a trope and organized crime is incidental). There's nothing wrong with that kind of movie, except the title in this case. (It's like The Karate Kid but with cars. The Car-ate Kid.) In fact, it's more of a sequel to director Justin Lin's 2002 film ‘Better Luck Tomorrow’, since it at least has a character in common with that movie (Sung Kang as ‘Han’). Might as well have called it ‘Better Luck Tomorrow, White Boy.’ 2. Lucas Black is a terrible actor. Who decided to turn this guy into a lead performer? I thought his 'Bama accent, wooden expressions, and awkward approximations of feeling were laughable when he was a child star on ‘American Gothic’. As an adult with ten years of experience, he should have made some progress. Alas, he has not. When your lead is inaccessible and unlikeable, your movie tends to suffer. 3. The cinematography and style are excellent and groundbreaking. The story is cliché and clumsy. The 3/10 score I gave it is ALL for the former. 4. Ooh, he wins the big race using an American car with Japanese guts. Do I smell symbolism? Yes I do, and it smells awful.",murrayspeer,2019-11-04,2019

9.0,My Favorite of the series,"I've watched all the series (except for the Hobbs spin off) and Tokyo drift is my favorite. Its like OHMSS of the Bond series, in that it fits in evolutionary point of the series where they get things just right, and there is a great balance.Lets face it, this is a divisive FandF movie. A lot of people hate it, and to many its one of the best, if not the best of the series.Tokyo drift doesn't have some of the ridiculous over the top unrealistics scenes, like cars shooting at planes, and fighting tanks or racing submarines. Some of those action sequences in the later movies are fun, but unbelievable and really take away from the tone of what is really a straight car action movie.Tokyo drift doesn;t ahve the other the top military aspects. Sure there is a Yakuza element, but ultimately, these are just people racing cars. There's no machine guns involved, no martial arts fights... its about car culture, and how that fits with people.The movie gets it just right. Justin Lin has come in and made it slicker than the first two movies, however it still relatively realistic unlike the later ones.On top of that, its set in an interesting exotic locale, and Lucas Black's character as a fish out of water character is interesting enough, as are some of the supporting characters, including Sung Kang. That said, bits of it are not authentic, and while Sonny Chiba is an icon in Japan, his English dialogue is stilted here.Overall, its the only one of hte series I watch regularly. The series could really benefit from having Lucas Black's character back involved!",info-5918,2019-12-18,2019

7.0,"Stellar for a Sequel, Just OK on its own","My first exposure to this movie was the theme song aptly named 'The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift'. The movie, once viewed, lived up to the expectations I had based on the style and energy of the song. Troubled youth Sean Boswell is shipped off to Japan to avoid jail time and falls in with a group of street drift racers. He befriends the only other non-native people, Twinkie and Neela, and becomes entangled with the local mob and his school peers. There is little need for the movie to exist, but boy is it fun. It feels almost like a playground drama blown out of proportion by the participant's minds, though the death and violence do upgrade the rating above PG. It feels a bit like a 'white man saves the day' story, given that it took an American to end Takaszhi's aggression in a flashy race. That being said, the franchise does tend to feature a specific type of leading man, and this is no exception to that theme.",rachelgallit,2020-01-30,2020
8.0,Best movie of the series,Tokyo drift was something different from the other movies of the series. Having a relatively unknown star-cast devoid of any superstars actually worked in favor of this movie. There was not much technology used here for planning a robbery or saving the world like the others. This movie gave a good introduction about drift racing especially on mountains like it has been shown in various video games as well. I would highly recommend this movie for a car racing as well as racing video games fans.,hemil_3000,2020-02-03,2020
4.0,The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006),"Directed by Justin Lin. Starring Lucas Black, Sung Kang, Brian Tee, Nathalie Kelley, Shad ""Lil' Bow Wow"" Moss, Brian Goodman, Sonny Chiba, Leonardo Nam, Zachery Ty Bryan, Nikki Griffin, Lynda Boyd. (PG-13)After getting busted for racing Tim ""The Tool Man"" Taylor's kid, American teen Black is shipped off to Tokyo to live with his Naval officer father (Goodman); there he attracts the attention of a girl (Kelley) who looks like she came from Japanese High School Musical, and her flat-nosed boyfriend (Tee), whose uncle (Chiba) has powerful Yakuza ties. Third outing has little connection to the rest of the series--at least, until a little retconning was done--but offers much of the same thing one has come to expect from the franchise: sleek autos, bare mid-riffs, incessant soundtrack cues, instructions to turn off the brain, etc. Lame, barely-existent plot spends way too much time away from revving engines; of the cast, only Kang's zen calm style is worth positive notice. The drifting scenes are sometimes engaging, except when mediocre CGI and aggressive editing spoil the fun (good luck figuring out what the heck happens during the last minute or so of the climactic chase). Even though it was and still is the least successful ""The Fast and the Furious"" movie--and nearly killed the then-flimsy franchise--director Lin proved the best fit yet, and was brought back for the next three entries. (Not much of) a surprise cameo pops up at the end for those who stick around that long.37/100",fntstcplnt,2020-02-09,2020

8.0,A Different Concept for Fast and Furious Series,"Tokyo Drift is a movie that brought a different concept to the Fast and the Furious Series. Previous films had ten-second speed races on the straight track. In Tokyo drift, races are not like that, the main thing is not to be fast, but to finish the race by doing good drifting on sweeping roads.It offers a different style to the audience as cars. We got used to classic American cars from previous movies. The audience also had the opportunity to watch Asian cars in this movie. There are plenty of racing scenes in the movie. It saturates the audience with races and action.The film generally focuses on Han. In the 6th film of the series, he talks about his life in Tokyo after Han decided to return to Tokyo.My favorite scene in the movie is the scene between Han and Sean on a balcony. There is a message about life here. I like that it contains messages about life in movies. The surprise at the end of the movie was nice, but I wish they didn't finish the race without showing who won.Having erotic scenes in the movie was not good in terms of the movie. I especially learned from the sex scene of two girls. I have never admitted having obscene scenes in movies.",drmuhammedsamiduru,2020-04-21,2020

There are more mind-blowing stunts and heart-pounding racing sequences than ever, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift will put you in the driver's seat. ‘Strap yourself in for a blistering, super-charged ride.’-- Pete Hammond, Maxim’ The CGI I am sorry but in one way it is terrible which I really did like when Sean story about him trying to start a new life on the other side of the world his obsession with racing after flipping his car in lA during a high school race through deserted building site. In Oro Valley, Arizona, high school students Sean Boswell and Clay race their cars to win the affections of Clay's girlfriend Cindy, driving their respective vehicles, But any way getting under the nose of the Japanese underworld he has to master drifting a new style of racing watching cars slide through corners and avoiding the edges of ravens as his nemises has killed han in a downtown race because (Lucas Black) and Neela (Nathalie Kelley) are slide down with the car during the car chase and they cross over the crowd of people without hitting anyone, they make this real looking the rest was okay. This is a very simple film, not a big confusing plot and again this films, you know the plots are still pretty slight this is not a heist movie, it's more about honour in japan was this guy the evil version of youSean has a confrontation with Takashi-the Drift King (DK)-over Sean talking to Takashi's girlfriend, Neela. Though barred from driving, Sean decides to race against Takashi, who has ties to the Yakuza. He borrows a Nissan Silvia S15 Spec-S from Han Lue, a business partner to Takashi, but loses his first race with Takashi and ends up totaling the car due to his inability to drift. To repay his debt for the car he destroyed, Sean agrees to work for Han. This leads to the duo becoming friends, with Han agreeing to teach Sean how to drift. Han also loans him a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution for future races, explaining that he is helping him as Sean is the only person willing to stand up to Takashi And a drive off for honor we want him to bring him down simple.7 you killed this guy's brother, he is looking for revenge and he also try's to kill you so you get this, simple movie not complicate at all. That is one thing that this movies get right constantly. From this film every time a Furious film is coming to the cinema I'm already on the seat for it to open. 6/10 This is the lowest in Grossing terms in the box office.

7.0,Fun but immoral,"The plot wasn't bad, but it was a bit wired that Japanese people in this film are not Japanese at all.

4.0,Uncharismatic,"The first true side story in the Fast & Furious saga. We leave behind both Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and instead focus on Sean Bowell (Lucas Black), an Arizona youngster, who gets into trouble with his reckless driving and gets sent to Japan to live with his father. There he yet again gets into trouble due to his need to go fast.And that's fine. On paper it'd be nice to explore other cultures and their takes on street racing. The story is also loosely tied to the overall saga with the introduction of Han (Sung Kang), who joins Brian and Dom in the following films as a part of their crew, becoming a beloved character.Unfortunately the plot and characters in this film - with the exception of Han - are as bland as rice paper. Sean as a character pales miserably next to the raw charisma of Walker and Diesel, and the fact that he's supposed to be a teenager doesn't exactly help things. (Black was in his mid-20s when filming this film. So almost a decade too old.)And even though the racing in the film is nice, like it's in all of the Fast & Furious films, it's not enough to save the film.Out of all the F&F films, this is the only one I'd say you can safely skip without losing pretty much anything.",Vartiainen,2020-05-08,2020
3.0,Worst of the trilogy,"The first movie was good, the second not so much...this one is terrible.
The main actor has to be one of the worst I've ever seen, he sounds like Forrest Gump and his 'acting' is like a child at a school play. The cars were good and some of the women nice to look at so if that's what you're here for you'll probably enjoy it.",Narcissist00,2020-05-21,2020
10.0,Favorite film of the franchise,"The original The Fast and The Furious was the Point Break of street racing movies. The film was so popular and well-received that it has spawned a bunch of sequels and offshoots. At this point almost 20 years later, it's kind of gotten out of hand. The franchise is now less about street racing and more about crazy superhuman stunts and world-ending subplots, basically James Bond with flying cars. It's pretty silly now. But, for my money, the first 3 movies of the franchise are ace. While the stories are pretty good, at their very core, the original trilogy of movies are about speed and the adrenaline rush of the race. And I'm probably one of the very few people on the planet whose favorite FnF movie of the franchise is this this third one THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS:TOKYO DRIFT (2006). Tokyo Drift is a simple fish out of water tale and the hero in this one is neither Brian nor Dom, but an outlier in the series high school student Sean Boswell (excellently played by Lucas Black), a troubled rebel loner who gets into trouble in the States in the film's opening sequence, as Sean takes part in a thrilling street race against the school bully (Home Improvement's Zachery Ty Bryan in a cameo role). The two boys are dueling over the bully's girlfriend and end up tearing up a bunch of property during their race. To keep Sean out of trouble, his mother ships him off to Japan to live with his estranged, stern father (well played by Brian Goodman). During his first day at his Tokyo high school, Sean struggles to fit in and is shown the ropes by fellow American Twinkie (played by rapper Bow Wow in a scene stealing performance), who hustles all kinds of products to make money. Sean also meets Neela (a stunning Nathalie Kelley), a beautiful Australian import who's lived in Tokyo since childhood. As Sean attempts to woo Neela, he meets resistance from her boyfriend DK (played with appropriate menace by Brian Tee), a local thug and nephew of the most powerful gangster in Tokyo. Sean and DK get into a race over Neela...sound familiar? They race in a high rise parking garage where DK easily schools Sean in this first encounter as Sean doesn't know how to ‘drift’ his car, a special technique that allows the driver to smoothly manipulate sharp curves while still maintaining complete control of the vehicle and stay in a race. The car that Sean damaged was owned by Han (confidently played by Sung Kang), a rich and mysterious player in Tokyo who seems to have a history as deep as his pockets. So Han decides to take Sean under his wing and have him perform special jobs for him to pay him back for the damaged car. During their joint venture, Han shares wisdom with Sean, while at the same time Twinkie helps Sean navigate the streets of Tokyo. Eventually, the trio come together as Sean, Twinkie and their crew including funny duo of non-talking side characters Earl and Reiko teach Sean how to drift so he can eventually have a final showdown with DK. Tokyo Drift is easily the most entertaining movie of the entire series telling the cliche underdog rebel story with energy, flair and humor. The cast plays well off each other. I find the Sean-Han dynamic to be just as engaging as the Dom-Brian one from the original film. And the movie never slows down. Even the heavy dialogue scenes are good. The scenic, eye-popping Tokyo setting is a welcome contrast to the more grungy American locales of the first 2 movies. Tokyo Drift is an anomaly where the 3rd film in a series may actual be the best of the lot.",hnt_dnl,2020-05-29,2020
5.0,Too much of a departure,"This film takes place in a completely different setting and has different characters from the rest of the series, although it is shoehorned into the continuity later. With all due respect to the main actor, he was clearly far too old to play a convincing high schooler. The cars and racing were cool, for sure, but the whole time I just wondering about the original characters.",briancham1994,2020-05-31,2020

6.0,Not Bad Not Great,Overall rating 6.4: The third film is definitely the black sheep of the franchise. I don't mind Sean in this movie but I would've liked to see Paul Walker in this film. I liked Vin Diesels cameo in the film and I think it was a nice touch. The film isn't as exciting as the previous two instalments and I think that Takashi is a pretty mediocre villain.

8.0,The fast and the furious Tokyo drift,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) in my opinion I think is a solid good action sequel, a very bashed and hated in the series. Which I don't think this movie is bad, I think is a much better movie than Furious 7. I always loved this movie, I think it is a good movie, but in the series is not the worst one, but is far from worst one that would be Furious 7. I think it was a different solid, good sequel in the series and I love it for an action film. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a fun movie to watch: it accomplishes what it set out to do and that's provide the most realistic yet gravity-defying racing sequences, backed with the eye-catching background of the electrifying, neon Tokyo. Plot-wise it suffers a bit and the acting isn't top-notch, otherwise the loud music, import cars, cityscape Tokyo, and Japanese pop culture more than make up for the flaws of the film that you'll watch it again and again.Plot: When convicted street racer Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) tries to start a new life on the other side of the world, his obsession with racing sets him on a collision course with the Japanese underworld. To survive, he will have to master drifting-a new style of racing where tricked-out cars slide through hairpin turns, defying gravity and death for the ultimate road rush.This movie is more the highest-octane installment of the hit movie franchise built for speed! There are more mind-blowing stunts and heart-pounding racing sequences than ever, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift will put you in the driver's seat. ""Strap yourself in for a blistering, super-charged ride.""-- Pete Hammond, Maxim"" The CGI I am sorry but in one way it is terrible which I really did not like when Sean (Lucas Black) and Neela (Nathalie Kelley) are slide down with the car during the car chase and they cross over the crowd of people without hitting anyone, you can see the camera, that it is made with a CGI that is the only main problem I have with the film, the rest was okay. This is a very simple film, not a big confusing plot and again this films, you know 5,6 and 7 the plots are still pretty simplistic.5 was a heist movie, 6 was this guy the evil version of you, we want him to bring him down simple.7 you killed this guy's brother, he is looking for revenge and he also try's to kill you so you get this, simple movie not complicate at all. That is one thing that this movies get right constantly.The racing in this movie: I think they did a better job than in 2, because I didn't noticed more of a CGI, because that's how they just do it now, a lot of wide shot you can tell there was a lot of practical stunt drive, it look good which I enjoyed that. I know a lot of people will put this movie lover down and I think it is a solid movie and a solid flick. This is the first time Brian Tyler made the score and this is also the first one that Justin Lin directed, he went later directing three next movies 4,5 and 6 which I love to death. I thought the direction is good, I like the resolves on the end of the movie, the sound track is good, I did not mind the cast you know. Lucas Black is the lead in this movie. Sonny Chiba is in this movie I always like the actor. This was Sung Kang's first introduction of his character Han who later appeared in 4 as a cameo, than in 5 and 6 as regular cast. Vin Diesel did returned with his character Dominic Toretto, who made a cameo scene on the end of the movie, which I thought was pretty cool. Bow Wow I didn't mind him in this movie and Nathalie Kelley was extremely hot and I really though she was much better sexy babe, than Eva Mendes was in 2 Fast 2 Furious. Nathalie Kelley lights up the screen as Neela and I would welcome her return to the series any time.Overall: Tokyo Drift gets a solid 8 by me it does lacks on the great characters and the cast of the first two movies in the series, but is redeemed by Han, awesome car scenes and a pounding score from Brian Tyler. I have enjoyed this movie and I",dilipbts,2020-06-09,2020
6.0,Better than F2!,"Without any of the original cast members I wondered how this installment would play out. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it more than '2 Fast 2 Furious'.The premise and the characters were much better than it's predecessor. This standalone sequel had lots more action than F2, and the action sequences are stunning! I cared more about the characters, and thought the actors did them justice with good acting. With the lack of comic relief that was just too much in F2, this was more serious and therefore more suspenseful.The events leading to the finale was well set-up as it built to a climax. By that time we knew the characters, and there's been great character development - especially from the lead, Sean (played by Lucas Black). Off course the stunning cars are back - more impressive than F2, and the film has a great rocking soundtrack for most part. The stunts are jaw-dropping.The finale was a thrilling, fast-paced visual spectacle. The film has a highly effective score - especially during the finale. Everything about this film was better than F2. Wow, this was incredible. I loved it! This is a darn good action film!",paulclaassen,2020-07-23,2020

3.0,Throw off the timeline,"Justin Lin comes into the franchise here and, well, he has none of the original cast members coming back. So what do you do? Concentrate on the cars. Also, the chronological history of the story would change from here on out, with installments until 2015's Furious 7 being set between 2 Fast 2 Furious and this movie. Yes, you'd be shocked how confusing - and deep - these movies go. I watched all of them within a day or two, so I'm still amazed how we go from street gangs to the family basically being the G.I. Joe team. High school student Sean Boswell keeps getting arrested for street racing, so he is sent to live in Japan with his father. There, he discovers, well, street racing. Are you surprised? There he meets Twinkie (Bow Wow), who gets him in and he starts doing that Tokyo Drift, as they say. Sung Kang, who plays Han Lue, originated that role in Lin's movie Better Luck Tomorrow. He'd return in Fast & Furious, Fast Five, Fast & Furious 6 and Furious 7, as well as the short film Los Bandoleros, all set between the events of Better Luck Tomorrow and this movie. Han's explosive car crash was revisited in post-credits scene of Fast & Furious 6, which introduced Jason Statham's Deckard Shaw. Boswell would return in Furious 7, while he, Kang and Twinkie will all be back for F9. How is Kang still alive? We'll see. Following poor test screenings, Vin Diesel agreed to make a cameo as Dom in exchange for Universal's ownership to the rights of the Riddick series and character. No money exchanged hands. I'm always amazed at how canny Diesel is. This allowed him to make 2013's Riddick as an independent film. Also, of course Dom won in the race against Boswell.

I thought actors were pretty good, at least main ones were really into their role , DK didn't even have to say anything he looked mean enough. Han he was sort of cool guy just sitting in background, and Sean was really into his role of learning how to drift. Neela is really pretty, prettier than other girls from the series.

6.0,A side story,"This review contains spoilers. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is the third installment in The Fast and the Furious franchise. It is a movie that stars a new cast of characters that engage in drift racing rather than the previous two movies' conventional racing. The movie follows Sean Boswell, played by Lucas Black, that is exiled to Japan following a street race that lands him in jail. Sean shortly after meets Han, played by Sung Kang, who teaches him drifting and the two form a friendship. Surprisingly, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift has a coherent story. This is a welcome change from 2 Fast 2 Furious' incoherent story. The movie follows Sean and the audience can see his journey as he tries to make things right with Han and his own father. The story and the characters are the good parts of this movie as I was engaged to find out more about Han and the drifting culture. The downside is the villains are not intimidating. I did not find them engaging and it felt that it was only a matter of time until they were overcome. The cast of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are not present as main cast members in this movie. This can be a disappointment to fans of the previous two movies as the two actors can be charismatic in their roles. This movie did feel less like the previous movies and more of a side story. The movie felt plausible in its execution of stunts and for this the movie can be enjoyed as a side story set in the same universe as the previous movies. The story keeps up the light-hearted fun of the first two movies but can delve into interesting plot turns. Han is a great character and I enjoyed every scene that he was in. I would recommend The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. Although the movie is not perfect, the movie is a complete stand-alone movie in The Fast and the Furious universe. Grade: C",anselmdaniel,2020-09-25,2020

7.0,Good film,"The plot is somewhat predictable, but it has some twists and turns (pun intented) along the road. I expected a more predictable plot and the racing is also nicely done. Not perfect, since some things are a little too much over the top in my opinion. Could recommend it to most car lovers.",jeroen_schepel,2020-11-12,2020
10.0,The best in the series,This is my favorite in the series. Han is my favorite character in the series.,randalgraves-26599,2020-12-09,2020
7.0,A fun car flick,"I feel like what the first two films relied on too much was CGI to make the races feel more vibrant. But there is a surprising lack of CGI here and that lack of CGI makes it feel a lot more real. As far as the races themselves go, I think the opening race (which these early Fast & Furious films had quite frequently, for those who don't know) is probably my favorite in the franchise, at least that I've seen. I'm not a super big fan of the main character (I'm terrible with names), I feel like he was not cast right and I think he was a very badly written character. In fact I'm not really fond of these characters in general. I felt like they were quite forgettable and, well, bland.If you're in the mood for a fun car flick and insane stunts, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is the film for you.",Z21708,2021-01-09,2021
10.0,Loved it,With neither of the main characters that fast and furious she is based around in I didn't think this would be great film but it's so good. in each movie after they introduce another character another bring Hans into it.

10.0,I watch this film at least 4 times every year,Not a huge fast and the furious fan but this is a whole other entity genuinely 15 years old now and still holds up the nostalgia is something else reminds you of great times - plus has one of the most iconic sound tracks of any film I've sent every song is spot on I just absolutely love this film and I hate cars,cameronmcclure,2021-01-31,2021
5.0,"For all its flaws and bad qualities, Toyo Drift still has its own appeal that makes it stick out from the rest of the FF series","Tokyo Drift has terribly written characters with a halfway decent story. The film feels a bit dumb at times, but still, setting the story in Japan which complimented the vehicles and the nightlife of the characters was a good choice, there are groovy tunes, cool cars, and even cooler street races that makes up for all of the films flaws. The street races in particular are pretty good and is what I would consider to be Tokyo Drift's most redeeming quality. It is also the film from the Fast and Furious franchise that doesn't feel the need for viewers to have seen the other FF films to understand what's going on.In short, dumb but fun.",CasuallViewer,2021-02-13,2021

9.0,The best F&F movie of all time !,"By far, the best car movie i've ever watch in my entire life ! This movie takes place in Japan and shows lots of cars especially from Japan such as the Nissan 350Z, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IX, Mazda RX-8, and many more Japan cars. This movie not only talks about Japan cars, but also talks about the Japan life such as the Tokyo's underground street racing, Japan night life, the school life in Japan, and Yakuza. Different from other fast and furious movie which shows about a heist movie with pretty cars, Tokyo Drift is made for car enthusiasts. What I like about this movie is how Japan people spends lot of time and money for their cars and do races with the cars they build. This Japan cars is mostly known as JDM cars which lots of car enthusiasts love them. The races the do in this movie is very intense and interesting to watch. In conclusion, this movie is made for car enthusiasts from all around the world who love cars very much, especially JDM cars. I highly recommend this movie because I love cars so much ! From 1 out of 10, I would rate this movie a 9/10 !",matthewjovian,2021-03-15,2021

8.0,One of the best movies of the franchise,"I don't know why this movie is rated 6/10, it's one of the best FF movies in the franchise.It has an original storyline out of all of them, great cars, great location, fab car races and quite stylish is some places - I mean it's Tokyo!The cast are also quite decent, I liked Lucas Black, who doesn't play a typical FF male airhead character like Vin Diesel and even (rest in peace) Paul Walker. Plot twist, he's a teenager too. Han is great, the gf and the villain/yakuza storyline.All later movies have just become unoriginal, car racing movies with dumb stunts tbh. I'll still watch them, as I always loved the first movie when it came out.But number 3 has held up quite well. Even in 2021.",indiana1981,2021-03-26,2021
7.0,The last one about actual racing?,"Look behind the woeful accent and this is actually a good movie. The first F&F was about racing, then went all Miami Vice. A final return to the street racing scene had to move away from the original cast as they had lost their 'From the streets' appeal.Anyway back to this, some sweet cars that aren't the massively expensive hyper cars of later episodes and some trick driving to boot.A quality film if you manage to watch it a couple of times and don't dwell on the accent.",sarnieken,2021-03-27,2021

I found the film to be pretty good! The fast cars, the action, the dazzling colours & the eye candy was all there & on point! The story was pretty good as well & the change in setting was decent!

3.0,Cinematic Noise,"The third film of The Fast and the Furious was cinematic noise. It was just engines revving and an obnoxious soundtrack that was used to tie together a flimsy plot and generally unlikable characters. It was a sequel that did not feature any of the previous actors (except for a cameo at the end) and could have easily been a straight-to-DVD film with little connection to the original. It was properly due to the film being shot in Japan that forced it to be a cinematic release. The filmmakers were even able to find a lead that was less charisma and acting ability as Vin Diesel and Paul Walker.The Tokyo nightscape was nice and there was some decent race sequences, but it not enough to redeem Tokyo Drift. It's amazing to think that Justin Lin and Chris Morgan were able to turn The Fast and the Furious into the juggernaut it became.",freemantle_uk,2021-06-16,2021
5.0,Disappointing,"I was really excited to see the city of Tokyo in a ff film and the city is truly beautiful. But everything else was lame.

And it clearly tries to copy so many things from the original.The only good thing to come out of this movie is the character han. The drifting was pretty cool too.

8.0,The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,"When I am watching the Fast and Furious movies I am not looking for a mind bending plot, I am looking to be entertained. That is exactly what this movie did. I really liked the how they kept the street racing aspect, but put a spin on it. The drifting was really cool, and the final race was arguably the best ending to any Fast and Furious movie at the time (It definitely wasn't after the later films came out). They probably should have brought back the original crew in this movie instead of waiting till the fourth installment, but just like 2 Fast 2 Furious, it ended up working out. I also really liked how this movie takes place after Fast and Furious 4, 5, and 6. I am so happy they did that and if you watched this movie, you know why.Don't listen to the critics, this was a good movie if you can get past the shaky plot, and decent acting, I recommend this for you. The movie did make up for that with great directing from Justin Lin who came back for Fast 4, 5, and 6, and some very likable characters like Han (Who is the only person besides a cameo from Sean in Furious 7 to come back). All in all, this was a pretty entertaining movie.",kaden_lewis,2021-07-02,2021
3.0,Short & Sweet,This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.It even has bow wow in it for some reason. He even winks at the camera at one point. So unbelievably stupid.,squall_teh,2021-07-09,2021
4.0,One Person Ruins the Whole Film,"The racing sequences and the entire concept of drifting elevate the Fast and the Furious franchise to a new level. Unfortunately, the casting of the protagonist in Tokyo Drift makes this film borderline unwatchable. Lucas Black does not look like a teenager, does not act like a teenager and is the opposite of what his character is supposed to be. Rather than a charming southern boy trying to find his way in Japan, Sean comes across as a creepy man-child too arrogant to respect those around him.I would only rewatch this film for one of two reasons: 1) To watch the epic drift race down the mountain (if only we could cut out the horrible, flip-phone huddled reactions) and 2) Han (easily one of the best characters in the entire F&F franchise). Justin Lin is better than this, which he goes on to prove with Fast Five and arguably the best episode of Community.",jace_the_film_guy,2021-07-15,2021
4.0,For me the film is an average movie,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is an action film directed by Justin Lin and stars Lucas Black, Bow Wow, Nathalie Kelley, Sung Kang, and Brian Tee.The movie is third installment of Fast and Furious series.The film is based on the life of teenager who is sent to Japan in order to avoid jail term is again being caught in between the drift racing.This is probably one of the most script-less film i have seen and it seems that the film is being made on the whims and fancies of the writer and director.The protagonist who is sent to Japan is being enrolled in school but i haven't seen him attending him any single class apart from only once scene of the school. From here the movie goes into predictable mode.The screenplay of the movie is decent but for me the movie was predictable and doesn't have anything new to offer.Acting was average and none of the character was memorable. The climax of the movie is also predictable.For me this is an average movie with nothing exciting to offer.",sauravjoshi85,2021-07-26,2021

6.0,Addicted to drifting and Japan Automotives.,"The movie is good, old-fashioned genre cinema done in a no-nonsense, straightforward style that is uncommon these days. The plot, about a troubled adolescent sent overseas to be straightened out, is completely conventional. Director Justin Lin demonstrates a talent for energetic filmmaking that was not even hinted at in his debut effort. Chris Morgan, the screenwriter, is well-versed in genre standards, providing just enough personality qualities to imprint characters in the minds of viewers.

The film is also instructive. One of the heroes, who is a mafioso in the film, said one phrase that I adhere to in life (and I advise you): ‘Because of a nail that was not hammered, a horseshoe fell off, a horse died because of a horse that died, a soldier did not deliver a report, because of an undelivered report, the war was lost.’ In general, the film was very cool and it is interesting to watch it all the time.

The thing is, the stunts are top notch, really good. But the story doesn't carry through Lucas Black seems to loathe every minute he is on screen, while cursing his agent, who got him the role(?). Even Paul Walker felt more ‘right’ in the franchise. If you wanna fast forward and watch the stunts, you might add a point or two to my vote.",lubrikatya,2022-01-18,2022

5.0,A little bit lost as to what the point of this instalment was,"I'm a big fan of the Fast franchise, but I must admit I'm struggling to defend this instalment.Yes, we are introduced to Han who is a great character and gets a lot of mileage in the franchise, but that is not enough to excuse the many flaws of this film.The main character... I'm sorry but this part was woefully miscast. Lucas Black did not work in this role at all. To offer some defence, the part was bland and the character awfully written, so he had little to work with, but in any case he was not the man for the job.The story is weak. There are some decent racing sequences but aside from Han the characters are such a chore.Ultimately this film suffered from being too detached from the main franchise. I think I benefited from watching it after having seen the later instalments with Han in, so it was nice seeing his origins. Aside from this though there is little to redeem this pretty bland entry into an otherwise solid franchise.",ethanbresnett,2022-03-26,2022

5.0,"half decent, half bore","I think it is ironic that this is called fast and the furious when half the film is utterly boring and pointless. The film had great potential, especially in the beginning. It covered the cultural shock quite well and in some ways, was hoping it would expand on it. However, after about 40% in, it decided to focus more on this ""drift world.""That in itself is not a problem, but suddenly it went from creative to cliche. At this point the plot just dragged and literally nothing happens for a while until the ending sequence.A better editing definitely could've helped, I would say trim it down to around an hour and 20 to 30 mins would make this film run a lot smoother.5/10.",Luv2Spooge,2022-07-03,2022
7.0,New story and new race.,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. New story and new race. Slightly different from the previous two films, the third part retains the style of FF, but adds a cool thing - drift.",kelvinselimor,2022-07-04,2022
6.0,Doesn't quite make it,This spin-off attempts to take the series into a new territory but it doesn't quite succeed. The main issues being some miscast actors and the insane lack of coherency with the storyline.,carberav,2022-07-29,2022
7.0,great cars great movie,"From the fast and the furious series, this film is one of the closest to its subject. The cast in the film, of course, does not reach the Oscar level, but not the worst either. The main character is not as charismatic and pleasant as Paul Walker, and the secondary characters, with the exception of Khan, are not as interesting as in the first two afterburners. It is quite possible to believe in the worldview and thinking of the characters. As for the plot, it looks quite logical and correct, but a little far-fetched. The combination of the mafia with street racing looks interesting, but at the same time a little strange, while watching, in principle, you don't think about it. Subplots such as the development of Lucas Black's character and Natalie Kelly's relationship are clichéd and simple. The cast in this fast and the furious film is new and it was a little unusual not to see the old people, and it's even a pity that they weren't there or they didn't participate in the film in any way. I think the fans would love that. As for the main icing on the cake for people watching this series of films, which is racing and cars, Justin Lin - the director of this film did an excellent job with this task. We see great tuned cars, and some of them are quite rare. It can be seen that they were not at all sorry for the moment with the breaking of one of the 350z, which makes us, the fans, very happy. Races are built in such a way that, from the point of view of logic and the most beneficial behavior of cars on the road, if you think about it, it's ridiculous. But despite all this, the action and beauty of drifting give you a great reason to close your eyes and just relax. And drifting in this film is the main driving technique. The film has some action, it's not hard to understand, it's a pleasure to watch because of the large number of cool and fancy cars that we never or very rarely see on our roads. He was created in order to lie down on his favorite sofa after a hard day, without loading his brain and enjoy what is happening in this film, which, in principle, he easily coped with as he should.",batyrkhanmanov,2022-09-07,2022
5.0,SOLID BUT PREDICTABLE,"Solid third installment of F2F franchise. The characters were interesting. The production design and the setting really helped propel the film to new heights. It was exciting to watch, and every scene was packed with action-filled sequences. The only problem I had was the predictability and simplicity of the story: an American teenager takes risks in the streets of Tokyo with bad-ass gangsters against him but eventually he emerges at the top. The movie could use a little bit of plot twists. The stunts were crisp-perfect and the camera work was absolutely amazing. The director really excels in this film genre.",jeromesgabilo,2022-09-26,2022
7.0,Surprisingly Stellar Entry,"After the far-fetched yet successful second entry to this franchise, I don't think anyone was knowing what to expect from an entry that did not contain any of the original cast and would be taking the franchise in a slightly different direction. Directed by Justin Lin and written by Chris Morgan, Tokyo Drift follows a character named Sean, who is sent to Tokyo to live with his dad after he causes too much trouble while racing a snobby kid from his school. Not wanting to follow the rules that his father has set for him, he races in a drift race after his very first day of school, losing but befriending a group of racers who take them under their wing, particularly a character named Han. However, this also puts him at odds with the son of a mafia leader, whose girlfriend he falls for, named Neela. Naturally, this all leads to them having to race each other to prove who's better. While Tokyo Drift won't be winning the franchise any points for originality, it's still manages to stand out amongst the rest of the Fast and Furious films. Lin brings a lot more emotional depth to this film than the two previous installments, which is helped by Morgan's more down to earth portrayal of the characters. There's a lot more character development here, and a lot more dramatic weight to the plot than it just being a racing or action film. I also really like Lin's directorial approach. He focuses a lot more on the characters rather than the cars, and while the racing is still essential to the story, it's not the main highlight. Also, the father and son story line with Sean and his dad is a nice change of pace for a franchise like this. With that said, it's not perfect. Some of the character development really does fall into the cliché, particularly with the character of Neela. Her damsel in distress storyline really does feel out of place in a franchise where the female characters have been generally portrayed as very strong in will and mind. The acting is the biggest positive for this film and highlights the main strength in handing this franchise over to Justin Lin. He really pushes the actors to deliver great performances throughout the entire movie. Lucas Black, Bow Wow, Brian Tee and Sung Kang are all really good in this. The only real negative aspect to the acting comes from Nathalie Kelly. However, in fairness, I think it's far less to do with her acting ability, than the way the character is written in general, because as I stated earlier, the character is very out of place. So overall, this movie surprised me a little when I first saw it and continues to surprise me when compared to the rest of the franchise, outside of maybe the first movie. While the story is not original, it has a heart to it that really helps it along the way.",Ggconte,2022-11-14,2022
8.0,Tokyo Racing,"The ""Fast and Furious"" dilogy in the early 2000s became a kind of canon for fans to see cool pumped cars with bright neon lighting. Drive, powerful soundtrack, interesting story - all this was present in the films with Paul Walker. And it was surprisingly unusual to realize that the third part would focus on completely different characters, and even on the other side of the Earth. At first, I observed myself a certain rejection in this regard to this project. However, after just a couple of dozen minutes, the plot is addictive, and the picture is fun to watch.""Tokyo Drift"" undertakes to tell about the nightlife of the capital of Japan, where the main character arrives. And even if he is still a high school student, the guy joins the nightlife of the metropolis, where there is also an underground world of beautiful tuned cars. The picture, however, focuses not on speeds, as it was in previous paintings, but on drifting, when craftsmen manage to drive not only fast on small sites, but also fit into turns, sending their cars into a controlled skid. It was a fresh trend of the film, it was shown in an interesting and tasteful way. However, this does not mean that nothing has been prepared here for fans of racing through the dark streets of the city. Such things are necessarily in store from the creators, and the tricks are performed at the proper level.The screenwriters did not invent something extraordinary in terms of the plot, habitually placing the protagonist in new living conditions for him, where he will have to make his way to the very top, be sure to get a powerful opponent and of course get a passion. The film is unlikely to present any surprises in the course of the plot, but in general the picture looks very cheerful, not allowing the viewer to lose interest in what is happening on the screen. The film catches, probably, in another way: a good video next to it and an ultramodern soundtrack that successfully fits into the corresponding scenes.The work of the whole team is impressive. On the screen we see the actors, their vicissitudes, but much in the film depended on the stuntmen and stunt directors. The guys did a great job, giving a really driving action for all fans of this genre.""Tokyo Drift"" turned out to be a good ""Fast and Furious"". Other, unusual - this is a fact. But after a couple of films in the series, viewers will realize that this is quite an interesting part of the overall franchise, and this picture has only expanded the edges of a huge world with a lot of heroes and villains for us. And they did it quite worthily.8 out of 10.",alekspredator87,2022-12-13,2022
7.0,It's either you like it or hate it.,"Despite its flaws, I'm still enjoyed Tokyo Drift to this day and it is still one of my personal favourites from this franchise. This movie felt like it rather take it easy and simple, but sometimes, simplicity worked better than being convoluted most of the time. The action sequences are a lot better than before, especially the last race segment. There's fair share amount of hot babes, if that's one of the the things you expect from this movie, and the score are probably the best in the franchise, in my opinion. Some of the characters are one-dimensional and stereotypical though, especially the MC, the script is predictable and felt familiar at times, and the fact that this sequel is almost completely different from the other entries might throw people off.",rimuruu,2023-01-15,2023
2.0,Truly shocking to watch,"As an expat living in Japan, I had resisted watching Tokyo drift as long as possible due to the overwhelmingly bad reputation the movie has. Despite which, I can say with sheer confidence that the last 17 years have done nothing to improve this film. The plot is both non existent and extremely pandering to some sort of American feverdream about what Japan is (spoiler, Japan is nothing like this). It only takes a few minutes of scrolling through the IMDB page to realise that none of the main actors are Japanese and the majority of the filming was done in LA. Threadbare plot and complete lack of cultural understanding aside, nothing is as unforgivable as the main actor who can barely read his English language lines off the page, not to mention Japanese -- though to be fair, no one seems to be able to speak Japanese in this film (Was there even a language coach onsite?). Long story short, if you want to see an adult man masquerading as a teenager in essentially a rehash of the worst tropes of the other F&F films, you're in the right place. Shoutout to all the other incredible reviewers down here in the 1-3 star range, I experienced a wider range of emotions reading these reviews than watching the entirety of the movie.",megandbeale,2023-01-31,2023
4.0,Terrible,"This movie was truly difficult to watch, and many parts we just skipped through as we cringed through some of the scenes and dialogue.It's hard to take seriously this movie about teenagers racing when the main ""teenage"" character looks like he is in his 30's and still attending school. Many of the other ""kids"" also looked way too old for their roles.The plot and story-line are weak, characters shallow and unsuited to their roles. This movie did not feel part of the franchise, and looks to be some bad idea turned into a bad movie. The current IMDB 6.1 rating is generous, in my opinion.I found the movie frustrating and couldn't wait until we had skipped through to the end.",bluesquirrel2004,2023-03-01,2023

9.0,Overall Tokyo Drift Was Another Banger For Me!,"Tokyo Drift is bringing back the more serious theme in the franchise after the pretty much light hearted 2 Fast 2 Furious, Lucas Black as the Paul Walker in this one, and Sung Kang as the Vin Diesel in this one, Sean and Han was basically the friendly bond version of Brian and Dom, Brian Tee as D. K. is a very convincing bad guy, he was great, and just like the previous movie, Tokyo Drift also fills with great badass exciting loud action sequence, great music, and the story in this one is so far the purest race car story in the franchise, added with a strong friendship elements in it, overall Tokyo Drift was another banger for me!",HabibieHakim123,2023-03-16,2023
6.0,The Third Installment Of The Fun Story,"The third sequel to the saga that is fun and ultimately proves to be a solid addition to the entire franchise.Yes, it doesn't have the same amount of fun as the previous two, but it's still good enough and gives us enough action to make it worth watching.The action this time takes place in Japan, and the main character is a teenager who goes to his father to avoid a possible prison sentence. There he gets involved with potentially suspicious characters and that's where the plot begins.We have some good races in the film, bad guys that our hero has to defeat, and a love interest. Everything you need for a fun movie.And the movie, for all its faults, is fun, starting with the great cars, to the hilariously entertaining villains and some good action scenes.Of course, not every film in the franchise will be of the same quality, but at least it meets the minimum criteria, which is to be entertaining and not bore the audience with things that have no place in a film like this.The film certainly deserves its place in the story, and in the end it turned out to be worth watching. Solid entertainment.",dk777,2023-03-19,2023
7.0,Best races and actually car focused,"The movie that initially was just a one-off that doesn't have any relation to the other two got the best car chase scenes and still is the most car-centric movie of the franchise. From the first second the music hits differently and then the racing immediately shows this is already way better than the 2nd part. It has conviction and heart to it that even some of the wacky themes, acting etc can be overlooked. It really makes no sense why the main character and everyone around him act as they do and why that actor was even chosen to be a 17-year-old when he doesn't even look young enough to be his actual age at the time. But the music and the races, the focus given on the drifting etc sweeps away everything else for the viewer. It's also wild that the character of Han and the director Justin Lin turned out to be kind of central figures in the future of the franchise. This is where the potential for the franchise really opened up even if it feels like a one-off.",Jithindurden,2023-04-19,2023

6.0,Was a good movie,"""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" is a mixed bag of a movie. On the one hand, it delivers on the promise of high-speed racing and exciting car chases that fans of the franchise have come to expect. The drifting sequences, in particular, are impressive and visually stunning. The movie also benefits from its unique setting in Tokyo, which adds a fresh and interesting perspective to the franchise.However, the movie also suffers from a lackluster plot and forgettable characters. The story feels flat and uninspired, with a predictable and clichéd plotline that offers little in the way of surprises. The characters are also underdeveloped, with none of them being particularly memorable or interesting.The movie's lead, played by Lucas Black, is particularly bland, with little charisma or personality to speak of.

3.0,Sore Thumb of the Franchise,One of the worst acted movies that's not considered a children's movie that I've ever scene. The lead actor looks like it's his first time in front of a camera and the story is equally as bad. It's unclear what the problem to be solved in the story even is. It's clear they wanted to make a feud between Boswell and DK but weren't sure how to do that so they just concocted some story about Han taking money on the side. In the other Fast and Furious movies there is at least reason for the car chases. For this movie all they want to do is show you car chases and in order to do so they make up a feeble story in order to show you endless drifting. Clearly they are hoping that the viewer is just mesmerized by the drifting otherwise I can't see what there is to enjoy otherwise. Even the love interest between Boswell and Neela is awkward. You re told pieces of her story but in the end she's only used seemingly to be a piece to be gifted to the winner of the races. No doubt a demeaning role.The only role this movie serves is to give you some more time with Han and it at least fits with the ending of Fast 6.,ThereelscoopwithKK,2023-05-10,2023
7.0,Deeper and darker,"Justin Lin's film is deeper and darker than the first two episodes of the saga. With actions followed by consequences and a sense of responsibility to be developed in order to be able to turn mistakes into learning opportunities, the plot is enriched with a deeper pedagogical meaning. Last but not least, the violent and shocking death of one of the film's characters, as well as the warning message at the beginning of the end credits, concerning the professional qualities and the strict safety standards necessary to make the film, remind us that driving in the public space must never be a mindless act disrespectful of the highway code, which protects our health and our life.",OMTR,2023-05-10,2023
3.0,Can the Fast and the Furious franchise drive any lower? Yes it can.,"Can the Fast and the Furious franchise drive any lower? Here the story of petrolheads racing shiny cars around switches from the US to Tokyo, Japan adding something new to the franchise that appears to go on and on...An unknown cast doesn't help the film retain a degree of interest to the average viewer. Some of the characters are meant to be 17 years old but are several years older in reality. The only difference between Tokyo 'Drift' racing is there seems to be more twist and turn manoeuvres making frequent tyre changes necessary!

6.0,Some things work and some clearly don't,"Tokyo Drift was a great idea to do a film in a different country with a unique spin to it. The setting was great, the storyline was not bad and it had some good energy behind it. It also a nice departure from the main characters that drive the Fast and Furious franchise. A series could get stagnant after seeing the same people. Injecting some new blood and story adds flair and broadens the franchise.Tokyo Drift reminded me how important the main character is to carry the film. This is where things fall short. Lucas Black, the lead of this film, is a poor lead. From this terrible accent that is not believable to his subpar acting and mannerisms. He lacks appeal, charisma and is quite dull to watch. He is given poor support from Nathalie Kelley, the romantic interest who is dull and not interesting at all. Their on screen chemistry was weak. Brian Tee made a good villain but this was to no avail as the two main cast members do not carry this film. You end up having a somewhat lackluster film in the end. 6/10.",Kingslaay,2023-05-27,2023
6.0,"Beautiful Tokyo setting, and awesome racing!","Review: As with the second movie, this movie is more of a stand-alone feature, and not a direct follow-up to the Fast and The Furious 2001. However the story is good as are the two leads in this movie. The script could have used work though. Takeaways: -Director justin Lin does a good job with the visuals and the action and racing scenes. No wonder the Fast producers asked him to come back to direct the sequels. -Lucas black was believable as trouble young street racer Sean, who is sent to live with his navy father in Tokyo by his mother to stay out of trouble. He befriends Street Racer/gangster Han Lue, who teaches him how to drift. I like this character, but he is a hot-head. -Later on Lucas Black would star in 6 seasons of NCIS New Orleans as Agent Chris Lasalle. -Sung Kang was great as Han Lue. I love how this drifter is edgy yet kind. We didn't know that So much hurt happened to him before this (explored in the other fast movies when he lost his girlfriend) -Bow Wow (Aka Shad Moss) plays Sean's friend and sidekick as they race against the gangsters in the end. -The Cars are beautiful and of course the racing was intense. -Hey was that Brad Taylor (Zach Tyler Bryan) for home improvement? -The script could have been a little better. Some scenes and dialogue I just cringed at. -I loved the ending scene with.... VIN DIESEL!!!! DOM TORRETTO IS BACK!!! WHOOOO!!! Also be sure to watch Furious 7 after this because it shows a lot more of Han's death and that a man who wanted revenge was responsible.",myblueblazer,2023-05-28,2023
7.0,Fast and The Furious goes back to high school and to Tokyo.,"This is the third installment in the Fast and The Furious franchise and it takes the story back to high school where a teenager named Sean Boswell seems to have gasoline in his veins but might be a little light on the brains as he keeps challenging people to race...even with a car that isn't his, in a country he doesn't know. Sean is a Navy brat whose mom has had to move around because of his street racing and getting into trouble. After a massive crash in a new development he is given a choice, either go live with his dad in Tokyo or go to juvie.That is how we end up in Tokyo and how Sean ends up learning how to drift when he locks horns with a Yakuza mob boss' nephew. He meets and makes friends with a little hustler named Twinkie and gets on the good side of Han who becomes his mentor. We find out later thanks to a cameo by Dom himself that Han and Dom used to run together...otherwise there is no real connection to the first two films.Definitely better than the second film, there are lots of great race scenes with some pretty good street racing stunts performed by their stunt drivers. Lots of drool worthy cars for the gear heads out there and done of the shortest skirts I have ever seen inname life.Great action entry in the series with a better story than the second film (and better race scenes), but still not as good as the original film.",cgvsluis,2023-05-29,2023

6.0,Roppongi Vice.,"Honestly, I think this is the only film in the F&F series that I hadn't seen prior to this little burst of rewatches I've been doing around ""Fast X"". I wasn't looking forward to it, as it's the lowest rated film in the series, but I found it to be pretty watchable stuff.Having been involved in an accident whilst racing, Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) is sent to live with his father (Brian Goodman) in Tokyo. He struggles to fit in but makes a friend in fellow American Twinkie (Bow Wow) who introduces him to the local street racing scene. The enigmatic Han (Sung Kang) offers Sean the chance to drive his car but, unfamiliar with the drifting technique, he crashes it. Indebted to Han, Sean starts to work off his obligation, but Han's friends, particularly Takashi (Brian Tee) who has Yakuza connections, take a strong dislike to him.So, whilst 'good' is still probably a step or two beyond it, I did, as I say, find the film the be pretty watchable stuff. It's again even more low key than the original film, let alone the way the many sequels have gone. Though there's a tangential link to the Yakuza there isn't even really that much crime in this film, (ignoring the one murder for a moment) it is literally just about street racing and for not much more than pride and status. Black is alright in the lead role, but there's definitely a reason that Han would be the character to recur more often in the series going forward, even though it would require not one, but two retcon's of his death for it to really make sense (such as it does). The film also has the legendary Sonny Chiba appear as Takashi's Yakuza uncle.Even though it's missing the sorts of stunts that the series is now famous for I didn't mind my time with Tokyo Drift and whilst I can't imagine rushing back to it again anytime soon, It was a reasonable time.",southdavid,2023-06-09,2023
6.0,One of the better movies of the franchise,"When it first came out, I was in fourth grade and knew nothing about street racing or cars in general. But my evolving fascination with automobiles led me to this franchise, and specifically to this third installment of the series. The sleek cars and high-speed chases intrigued me, and it opened up a whole new world.Yes, you heard it right. Tokyo Drift was the first Fast & Furious movie I saw on television, thanks to a DVD disc I randomly came across.Seventeen long years have passed, and my perceptions of the series as well as cinema as a whole have changed considerably, but upon revisiting, I realised I still adore this movie, primarily because it stayed true to the central theme, which was racing. Unlike other movies in this series, where varied storylines frequently come to the fore, things have been kept fairly simple here.The fact that they prioritised ""Racing"" over everything else was something I really liked, despite the film's own share of problems. Therefore, it has always been one of the better entries in the F&F franchise for me.",SoumikBanerjee1996,2023-06-09,2023

It was also cool how it was eventually made to be tied in with other films in the franchise. The main character had a pretty decent origin and while it is far fetched that he would be sent to Japan after he committed a big crime in the U.

It's about JDM's in Tokyo and drifting, what's not to like about it? Lost people didn't like it and as a result, we're experiencing the PTSD of Fast 9 and X. This movie dared to be different and it worked. If they made another one similar to this focusing more on the Japanese car culture, it could've been a WIN. But no, we have to deal with the Fast X and I'd rather watch Transformers honestly. This is a great movie compared to most of the Fast movies. Vin diesel killed the Fast franchise. The series are becoming more like the expendables movies. If they think Fast 9 and x are great, then unplug me from this reality.",stevetelfer,2023-08-03,2023
9.0,A different world,"""Fast & Furious 3: Tokyo Drift"", the third installment in the franchise, shines brightly with its unique approach to the series. The film takes a daring leap by shifting its setting to Tokyo and introducing a new protagonist, Sean Boswell, portrayed by Lucas Black. This change of pace infuses the series with a fresh burst of energy, showcasing the fusion of American car culture with Japanese drifting techniques.The movie's greatest strength lies in its breathtaking racing sequences. The art of drifting takes center stage, transforming car chases into mesmerizing dances of controlled chaos. Director Justin Lin's keen eye for dynamic camerawork captures the essence of these moments, allowing viewers to feel the adrenaline rush as they immerse themselves in the high-speed world of Tokyo street racing.Tokyo itself becomes a character, with its neon-lit streets and pulsating nightlife forming a vivid backdrop for the story. The film's ability to transport audiences to a completely different culture while maintaining the essence of the series is commendable. The music, a mix of hip-hop and electronic beats, complements the fast-paced visuals perfectly, elevating the overall experience.However, amidst these positives, some aspects falter. The absence of series regulars like Vin Diesel and Paul Walker is noticeable and their absence creates a void that even Tokyo's vibrant energy struggles to fill. Lucas Black's portrayal of Sean lacks the charisma and depth of his predecessors, which sometimes makes it difficult to fully invest in his journey.In conclusion, ""Fast & Furious 3: Tokyo Drift"" stands as a bold departure from the franchise's formula, exploring new territories and introducing viewers to a different facet of the car culture. Its stunning racing scenes, immersive setting, and eclectic soundtrack make it a standout entry. Yet, the absence of familiar faces and a slightly weaker lead performance are notable drawbacks. Despite these minor shortcomings, the film successfully rejuvenates the series and remains a memorable chapter for fans and newcomers alike.",uhudsavascisi,2023-08-17,2023

ACTION DRAMAIn order to appreciate this film, one must first like to see street racing films and alter his/her mind to not affiliate it with other ""Fast & The Furious"" films because none of the main stars are from anyone from the previous films but can be made entertaining as a film as it's own film! Story centers on rowdy American teenager whose known to drag race and always gets himself in trouble with the law but is the final straw, and he gets sent to Tokyo to live with his father to finish his schooling. Soon after he gets mixed up with another Japanese teenager whose associated with the Yakuza, Japan's equivalent of the mafia, with at the same time build rapport with another Asian person called Nam who also is attached to racing as well! The racing is not like the other races he's done on America but is introduced to 'race drifting' where the driver is driving around narrow roads and passageways like a tall building parking garage! Director Justin Lin must've seen a lot of Asian racing films such as ""Full Thottle"", ""The Legend of Speed"" and Jackie Chan's ""Thunderbolt"" to name a few where the acting is not so great but the racing scenes are the main focus and not so much on acting or story! Also interesting is that the film allows the actors to use their natural accents for there's an actress who has an Australian accent, natural Southern American accent and of course Japanese and Korean! There's some good one-liners and beautiful scenic buildings of downtown Tokyo, where the lights look great upon the reflections on the cars, and the techno pop soundtrack all works well with this film except that in terms of car crashes done on this film- it consists of stuff we had already seen before or done on previous films made before it, with the only difference that they're done on Tokyo and done on those specific models which there is nothing wrong with that too.",jordondave-28085,2023-09-24,2023
5.0,"Women, yakuza and engines!","Tokyo Drift does not deny itself about the main character of the story, a disbanded boy. The story focuses on clandestine races, skirmishes with the mafiosi on duty and the inevitable love story between the protagonist and the beauty of the group. The result of a simple frame for spectacular drifting rides. The budget of the film, which however turns out to be quite high, has therefore served mainly for three things: special effects, luxury cars and to pay a small cameo by Vin Diesel. The direction is excellent, with shots that impeccably emphasize the action scenes, but it must be admitted that even at the current state of affairs manages to break the monotony of the series, which had seen the protagonists always and only run on classic American tracks, so abused as to be unattractive for the viewer.",il_criticone,2023-10-06,2023
4.0,Not that bad,"It just didn't age well. I mean. It's okay but with way too long driving sequences. Horrible acting and casting. Sad to say that bow wow is doing the best job and is most believable ... that says it all. Story is thin. Didn't expect much other than that, but even in that regard, the whole concept is just way too thin and unrealistic.But - it will keep you fairly entertained for an hour or so. So why not.One thing however. The main character ... supposed to be 17???? Like no. Like really, really no. Almost ruined the entire movie, because it was that unbelievable. How did this even happen...",ncarolines,2023-10-14,2023

6.0,Lead actor has zero charisma,"What a wasted opportunity. I enjoyed so much of it but Lucas Black ruined it for me. His accent, due to the uniqueness of it, although real sounds so fake. Terribly made up and forced. It made for a really looooooong movie. He sounded strange in the American setting but in Tokyo- ridiculous. I'd buy it if he made up for it with his acting but to quote someone on reddit ""has the charisma of a wet blanket"". Nor was he hot enough to be a main character in this. He didn't interest me enough to make me root for him like the other movies in the franchise. Luckily there's plenty of other f&f movies to watch.",sallymichellenelson,2023-11-08,2023
6.0,It almost got everything to form a band.,"It's probably the best racing movie I watched. It cooked up my natural teenage dream. And, then it soaked it in some off the race worlds biggest attractions and the power of the drifting takes. It's very infecting in the beginning. And, it actually takes across to a smooth ending without getting anyone obsessed. I didn't like the final battle. There's no baffle to the stake at the mountain. That mountain did not disrespect anyone. I've been to that mountain. I ran on that mountain. I ran down. I skipped and I avoided. And, I fell. I tumbled down. I turned my way to and out to the road. Some say walking and talking makes the way long. This movie has a great balance. Without looking back.",degokasari,2023-11-10,2023
6.0,Main character ruins the movie,"Great cars and chase scenes in this movie. Based in Tokyo it made the perfect setting for a movie like this. So everything is great and this should easily be 9/10 movie but one thing and one thing only ruins this movie completely..... the main actor. How can the directors pick the most unlikable actor when everything else was spot on. I get the character in the movie is supposed to be some annoying juvenile but there were probably hundreds of other actors that would have played this role a million times better, even ones that are not overly famous. For example...Sean Faris (main actor from 'never back down') would have been perfect. But even Borat would have done a better job than the current actor. Completely missed opportunity for potentially one of the best films in this franchise.",Haris-Khan-72702,2023-11-15,2023
8.0,tokyo drift,"The cast of the third movie, which has a different atmosphere than the first two series, includes new actors and new locations. First of all, the director of the series has changed again, Lucas Black plays the leading role, there are also prominent people in supporting roles, but I did not know anyone in the cast. Lucas Black's performance was okay, but he was too old to be a high school student under eighteen, D. K. He did justice to his evil character, but he was also very repulsive, the Han character was good. Unlike the first two films, the production takes place in Japan. Shaun, who had to go to Japan to his father because of a car race that ended in an accident at school, will try to establish himself here and beat the drift king. The movie starts with an average car race that starts with a trivial reason, and then moves on to the drift-filled nights of Tokyo. Although the script had no weight and was full of clichés, the racing scenes were very good, especially the chase before the finale and the final race were memorable, and both the Six Days and Tokyo Drift tracks were good, the other music was not bad either.",burakgezzginci,2023-11-26,2023
10.0,All about cars,"First 15 minutes of the movie was kind of off, but as the movie progressed, keeps you on the line to watch the rest of it. Movie that shows the reality of car fanatics. Truly mastering the art of drift step by step, not just planting an skilled character. I liked the development and the funny aspects of the movie. Rebuilding a car from scratch in the final race, showing determination to the art of true race. Also its all about the Japan car culture and the crazy modified cars out there. Truly underrated movie, came back to write this review after watching the 8th movie of the Fast and Furious series.",eleftheriaallagianni-09411,2024-01-24,2024
6.0,Overhyped,"Watched this like 18 years after its launch and was overhyped to the point of making it a religion. I am a weeb, so I understood some of the words like gaijin (meaning tourist or outsider). After watching it I also realized that DK had no traits that make him a compelling villain, the main character's gf (Beth?) just said ‘Oh we went to Touge to watch kids drift until we got out rides and started drifting together’ and ‘DK used to be so nice and kind before, until he started to assimilate himself into the yakuza world’. Which is such a lame ass backstory for someone who became the MAIN ANTAGONIST! He was given the worst treatment a character ever gotten, he only existed to be a villain, not a man who became the villain.",thinezequieltan,2024-02-16,2024
6.0,Different from the rest.,"""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" veers off the established path of its predecessors by transporting us to Tokyo, introducing a fresh narrative centered around the art of drifting rather than traditional racing. This third installment distinguishes itself with a heavier emphasis on visual storytelling, capturing the neon-lit streets and the unique underground drift culture. Although it departs from the familiar faces and racing styles of the first two films, ""Tokyo Drift"" offers a compelling exploration of growth and redemption, wrapped in a visually stunning package that pays homage to a distinct automotive discipline. Its deviation from the series' formula marks it as a standout chapter, enriching the franchise with its unique perspective.",schmittfalte,2024-02-24,2024
2.0,Famous Toyo Drift?,"There was nothing I liked about this movie (except maybe the Hulk car), so I can't even give it 3 stars. I wish I could, but my heart will not allow it.I was bored the entire time. The ENTIRE time. The highlights of this movie were still boring to me, and it didn't matter what the stakes are and how many visual effects or mind blowing drifts were there on the screen. I simply didn't care.I had no reason to, really. Why would I? We got completely new, random character and were told basically nothing about the guy, but the fact that he was a bad boy who liked to smash some cars and get as many girl as possible. After finishing the movie I still feel like I don't know him.The reason is - I didn't pay attention. I know I didn't and I could probably blame myself for that but then again why would I? The movie wasn't interesting. It didn't show me why I should forget characters from previous Fast & Furious and instead focus on the new Mr Bad Boy. I didn't WANT to pay attention. I just wanted to get over with it and skip to the next part.Maybe the reason why so many people liked it is because they remember it from when it came out. Maybe back then it was a real banger, maybe it was new and refreshing. But we're not in those time anymore, and as much as I love the first F&F, this one definitely didn't age well. Unless you're just a big boy who likes to watch cars. There's nothing wrong with that, we all like something that objectively, let's be honest, isn't really that good. This time it's just not the case for me.",polajakimowicz,2024-02-25,2024
8.0,I expected at worse but it is nice movie of the franchise,"After have watched the two movies of the franchise I expected a new character very bad and not interesting and a story very bad about it, well not I was completely I was hooked all the way through because the story is very nice and all of cast for the nice part or the bad guys was great they came out on top !!The two protagonist miss at the franchise okay but for this movie without them with new character it was very nice the movie stay anyway still interesting and entertaining is that we expected us as an audience !This third movie is the most stand out of the two prequels maked before, and that important cause the secondary movie was annoying this one, this third not at all !The script and directing is very nice.",tomlaju,2024-04-20,2024
8.0,I love drift,"""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" is a movie bomb. A completely different plot from the first 2 films with a story set in the future. The beauty of this movie is that you could also see it without watching the saga, although you would not understand the ending, which I really liked and has a crazy soundtrack. In my opinion the film really comes to life in its second part, the first is a bit more boring, the second is spectacular. Even here the characters are introduced very well: the best for me is Han, simple but essential, with a great interpretation of Sung Kang. I also liked D. K. with a great interpretation of Brian Tee and Twinkie of Bow Bow. One character that I never fully appreciated in all the visions of this film is Neela, she never gave me anything. The protagonist Sean has convinced me a lot and I can't wait to see him with Brian and Dom. The direction of Justin Lin in my opinion exceeds that of the first two chapters with many spectacular shots and has organized the film very well. In my opinion this is (compared to the first two films) the one with the best car races. I also liked the photography a lot. The most beautiful thing about this film are the soundtracks, unforgettable and perfect for the fantastic Tokyo setting. In my opinion this film, like the whole saga, is too underrated, these films are bombs and if they are seen to have fun and see the beautiful action scenes are masterpieces, stop. I never get tired of this movie, even if I've seen it five times..

5.0,Solid entry to the franchise,"This one is tough for me to rate because it has some interesting ideas in it, but not all of it works for me. Unfortunately I don't like Lucas Black as Sean Boswell especially his accent was really annoying me. The whole story of the American highschool kid getting tangled up with the Japanese mafia also isn't 100% believable. What saves this for me is the racing aspect of this movie. The actual racing sequences and seeing the whole training that goes into becoming a good racer was really enjoyable. The stand out character here is Han who really made his case here for being brought back for later movies of this franchise as they eventually did. Overall I can neither love nor hat this movie, but it does enough to have a fun time watching.",tk_ew,2024-05-30,2024
7.0,watch it again in 2024 !,"Watched tokyo drift for the second time after 18 yrs
yup i enjoyed it ..even more
i ithink its one of the best of the fast and furious series .. FF 1 , FF 2 and tokyo drift the other in the series just too many gimmickIn tokyo drift they have:
no CGI
normal car with a good modification....
normal person as a driver not a secret agent man or super soldier...
no such thing as a ""family""
more believable story than the other in the series , no car vs tanks, no car vs submarine , no car going to outerspace just car vs car
so please make FF series like this ..about race + nice car and speed.................",tio-01602,2024-06-03,2024
5.0,Karate Kid on wheels,"It's the exact same story as The Karate Kid only it takes places on wheels.. In Tokyo. Think about it.. New kid moves into town, gets defeated by the ‘villain’ early on, starts training, gets his revenge and wins the girl in the end.. Han may not have served as a mentor the same way Mr. Miyagi did but it's obvious where they got their inspiration from. Some people claim it's the weakest movie in the series while other claim it's their favorite. Personally I think it's one of the weaker ones but the standards are not particularly high to be fair. You watch these movies for the thrills and the hot woman, not for the ‘deep’ story, or lack thereof. This is the least action packed movie in the series and action is pretty much all this series has to offer. The Vin Diesel cameo was cool but that's the only thing positive I have to say about it.",askeland89,2024-06-07,2024
5.0,"Finally, a Fast & Furious for the weaboos!","The third chapter in the original Fast & Furious trilogy is the last car-centric film in the franchise, this time focusing on the car culture of Tokyo. It succeeds in being a love letter to the city, but changes the formula for the franchise too much in ways that don't work.An attempt at returning to the Teensploitation type tone, Tokyo Drift feels like a stand-alone film but is actually a monkey wrench in the Fast & Furious timeline. Han is easily the best character and is the only one to join the family in other entries in the series. The other characters are straightforward stereotypes without the cheesy charm of past leads like Diesel and Walker..",mediatation,2024-06-16,2024
5.0,The Flat and the Furious.,"My journey through the Fast and the Furious series has brought me to the third film, Tokyo Drift, which - alongside Fast Five - was one of the only movies in this series I'd seen some years ago. I remembered basically nothing about the film, and rewatching it, I can see why. It's a bit of a snooze, even though there are moments that are kind of fun here and there. I think it has a good final act... actually, that's where most of the fun stuff is. It opens with a stupid, over-the-top race, and then meanders for about an hour or so, all before finally delivering some decent action in the last half-hour.I'd say it's better than the first movie, and I genuinely wonder whether I'll get to the end of the series now liking all the sequels more than that one. I think it disappoints a little after the second movie, though, which I was pleasantly surprised by.Tokyo Drift did the impossible by making me wish Vin Diesel would return to the series. The protagonist of Tokyo Drift is very bland, and when Diesel shows up in his cameo near the end, he's so much more charismatic. Guess that sometimes, you don't know what you've got until it's gone. But Paul Walker still trumps Diesel at this stage, and I wonder if Tokyo Drift would've been a little better if they got his character wrapped up in all the stuff the actual main character does.Here's hoping the fourth movie and those after are better. I like these movies when they get silly and over-the-top (and when they're less about racing too, to be honest), and I wish Tokyo Drift had been more consistently goofy. I only really had fun in the final act, and most of the film before then made me feel tired.",Jeremy_Urquhart,2024-06-18,2024

8.0,It's honestly underrated.,"**Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift** - A Thrilling Yet Underrated Gem""Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,"" the third installment in the high-octane franchise, is often overlooked and underrated. However, it stands out with its unique setting, distinct storyline, and engaging car culture that deserves an 8/10 rating for its sheer entertainment value and innovative approach to the racing genre.Set against the vibrant backdrop of Tokyo, the film immerses viewers in a world of underground drift racing, a subculture known for its precision and artistry. Unlike its predecessors, ""Tokyo Drift"" departs from the familiar characters and locations, offering a fresh perspective and introducing a new protagonist, Sean Boswell, played by Lucas Black. Sean's journey from a troubled teen in America to a drift-racing sensation in Japan forms the crux of the narrative.One of the film's most vital points is its authentic depiction of Tokyo's urban landscape and the intricacies of drift racing. The cinematography captures the city's neon-lit streets and bustling energy, creating a visually stunning experience. The racing scenes are meticulously choreographed, showcasing the skill and finesse required for drift racing. The film does a commendable job of making these sequences thrilling and immersive, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats.Lucas Black's portrayal of Sean is earnest and relatable, even if it lacks the charisma of some of the franchise's other leads. His character's growth and adaptation to a new culture add depth to the storyline. Sung Kang's Han Lue, a fan-favorite, brings a sense of cool and calm to the chaotic world of drift racing, and his mentorship of Sean adds a layer of camaraderie and heart to the film.The supporting cast, including Bow Wow as Twinkie, provides moments of fun and grounding in an otherwise high-stakes environment.

The dynamic between Sean and Takashi drives much of the film's tension, culminating in a gripping climax.""Tokyo Drift"" is not without its flaws. The storyline can sometimes be predictable, and some character arcs feel underdeveloped. However, these shortcomings are overshadowed by the film's strengths. The soundtrack, featuring a mix of hip-hop and electronic beats, complements the fast-paced action and enhances the viewing experience.What truly sets ""Tokyo Drift"" apart is its celebration of car culture. The attention to detail in the vehicles, from classic muscle cars to sleek Japanese imports, is impressive. The film pays homage to the art of car modification and the passion of racing enthusiasts, making it a must-watch for automotive lovers.In retrospect, ""Tokyo Drift"" has aged well, gaining appreciation for its bold departure from the main storyline and its focus on a different aspect of the racing world. It serves as a bridge in the franchise, introducing elements and characters that become pivotal in later films.In conclusion, ""Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" may not have garnered the initial acclaim of its predecessors, but it deserves recognition for its unique contribution to the franchise. Its exhilarating racing sequences, authentic depiction of Tokyo, and deep dive into drift culture make it an underrated gem that merits an 8/10 rating. Whether you're a fan of the series or new to street racing, ""Tokyo Drift"" offers an engaging and visually captivating ride that shouldn't be missed.",zzbvrfwk,2024-06-26,2024
5.0,The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift - Jamison Slabaugh,The film is a fun thrilling ride like the first two Fast and Furious films. The street racing cinematography in this film is done much better in my opinion. The pacing and score aren't the best but they don't stand out as issues either. This film is very disconnected from the first two as the film picks up with a new character called Sean. He runs away from all of his problems. Every time he might go to jail he moves away. When he gets to Tokyo and doesn't know how to drift he gets humbled real fast. The love interest in this film is weak in my opinion due to the fact that she has no motives or real character behind the face. The antagonist is just fine. He works for the film but he's nothing special due to the fact that again he doesn't really have any motives other than the fact that Sean embarrassed him and he values pride. Now the relationship between Sean and his father works very well in the film. His father understands and relates to Sean making the decision to not run away from his problems this time. He also just wants what's best for him. Overall not a bad film. 6/10 STARS.,jamisonslabaugh,2024-07-05,2024
7.0,"""One car in exchange for knowing what a man's made of? That's a price I can live with.""","FILM: 7.0
Rewatching the 2006 film The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, I find myself enjoying it more than most people seem to. So, here's an unpopular opinion: Tokyo Drift ties as my third favourite film in the series. The film ramps up the fun straight away, ditches the cheese of the second instalment, and goes for an original plot.One of the aspects I appreciate most about Tokyo Drift is its unique setting and storyline. Shifting the focus to Tokyo and introducing the world of drift racing feels fresh and exciting. The races and chases are some of the series' best, with a kinetic energy that keeps me engaged throughout. The soundtrack is another highlight, with its thumping beats perfectly complementing the high-speed action.I know people heap crap on it for not keeping it in the ""family,"" but it's an undeniably fun ride. The absence of the core characters initially feels strange, but the new cast manages to hold their own. Lucas Black as Sean Boswell brings a different kind of protagonist to the table, and I find his journey from outsider to drift racing aficionado quite compelling.The character of Han, played by Sung Kang, is a standout. His cool, mentor-like presence adds depth to the film and makes for some memorable moments. The Tokyo setting is visually stunning, and the film makes excellent use of its locations, showcasing the vibrant cityscape in a way that's both thrilling and immersive.What I like about Tokyo Drift is its ability to balance the adrenaline-pumping action with a story that feels grounded. The film doesn't rely on the over-the-top stunts that the later entries in the series do, and that simpler approach works in its favour.Overall, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a fairly positive experience that brings something fresh and exciting to the franchise. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, I find it to be a fun and engaging film that stands out in its own right.FORMAT: Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.0

4.0,Worst one so far,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift brings a fresh setting to the franchise, trading the familiar street races of LA for the neon-lit streets of Tokyo. While the change in scenery adds some visual appeal, the film struggles to capture the same excitement of its predecessors.The drift-racing scenes are well-shot and provide some adrenaline, but the weak plot and lackluster characters weigh the film down. Lucas Black as the lead feels out of place, and his performance is wooden, making it hard to connect with his journey. The dialogue is often clunky, and the absence of key franchise characters leaves a void that's hard to ignore.The movie's saving grace is its depiction of Tokyo's underground car culture, which adds a unique flair. However, without much substance behind the flashy action, Tokyo Drift ends up feeling like a hollow entry in the Fast & Furious series.",Bmore-Hero,2024-09-20,2024
10.0,Underrated Movie Gem (11/10),"I really cannot state enough how much overhated this movie was back in the day and actually still is, one reason being that (Tokyo Drift) actually is The Fast & Furious film to follow the street racing format the most, while it also is one of the most realistic F&F films and it also have some of the best, most intense and most believable acting in the whole franchise, Though these reasons a not actually the reasons that I really believe that this movie doesn't get the love it deserves. No, what I really believe makes Tokyo Drift stand out is that how perfect the cast is and how nearly every actor in Tokyo Drift compliments each other in so many ways and gives it so much more believability, and really just makes it the best action movie having the aspect of cars, love and friendship being put so perfectly together giving you A Racing film which fits Don Torreto's way of thinking way better than the mainline F&F movies about what family is and how we as humans have to stand together with those who have helped us through life!!",RealCJHopkins,2024-11-01,2024
6.0,Probably the best entry in the franchise so far.,"Tokyo Drift feels like it's actually trying to be a normal film. There's barely any horrible CGI and the driving stunts are more impressive than ever.I remember a lot of the audience at the time being annoyed that Vin wasn't the main character. I couldn't care less. Sean is a decent protagonist and Han is the most interesting side character so far.The setting is the most interesting part, they manage to sell it as Tokyo pretty well and there's a great chase sequence in the streets.When it comes to the writing, the dialogue is laughable at times, and the tropes of the franchise are very prevalent in this one.However, the worst part about the film's story is that the writers for later films want us to believe this entry takes place in 2014. Ah, 2014, the age of flip phones and 2006 music. Yeah, nice work guys.At least it's a big step up from 2 Fast 2 Furious. Who could have predicted the trajectory of the sequels after watching this?",H4wke,2024-11-05,2024
7.0,Drifting into a Side Story: A Review of The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, released in 2006 (but still very watchable in 2025!), Like I said in my previous review for 2 Fast 2 Furious, this one also feels less like a direct sequel and more like a high-octane DLC or spin-off to the first two films. While it doesn't quite reach the heights of The Fast and the Furious or 2 Fast 2 Furious, it still manages to deliver a fun, albeit flawed, experience that car enthusiasts will likely enjoy.This installment shifts gears, leaving the familiar faces behind and introducing us to Sean Boswell, a troubled teen with a penchant for street racing. We get a fleeting glimpse of his life in America before he's shipped off to Tokyo to live with his estranged father. Here's one of the biggest drawbacks: Sean's backstory feels rushed and underdeveloped. His motivations beyond the need to escape trouble aren't fully explored. The absence of any real delving into his relationship with either his mother or father feels like a missed opportunity for emotional resonance, leaving them as mere plot devices rather than fully fleshed-out characters.The same can be said for the primary antagonist, DK, the ""Drift King"". While his scenes are effectively antagonistic, the movie glosses over his character beyond his rivalry with Sean and his connection to his mob-boss uncle. We barely scratch the surface of what drives him or his position in the Tokyo underworld, making him feel like a fairly one-dimensional villain. I think with more character development on DK and Sean's family, this would have been a much better movieDespite these shortcomings in character development, Tokyo Drift shines in other areas. The introduction of Han, with his effortlessly cool demeanor and laid-back wisdom, is a definite highlight. He quickly became a fan favorite for a reason, and his presence elevates the film. Neela, Sean's love interest, also provides a strong and engaging personality. She adds a layer of complexity to the story rather than just being a damsel in distress.Visually, Tokyo Drift is a treat. The detailed model cars, a reflection of the drift scene in Japan, are fantastic, and the vibrant soundtrack perfectly complements the fast-paced driving sequences. The film captures the neon-drenched, bustling atmosphere of Tokyo, creating an immersive and aesthetically pleasing experience. The drift sequences are exciting and entertaining, even if they don't always push the limits of reality. I think the cinematography and editing is quite good here.Overall, Tokyo Drift is a decent entry in the Fast & Furious franchise and is an enjoyable experience. It's a step down in terms of character development from its predecessors and feels more like a side story than a direct continuation, but It still delivers a visually engaging and entertaining ride. The Tokyo setting alone is worth the watch, and the introduction of Han makes for a memorable character. While not perfect, Tokyo Drift earns a solid 7/10, proving that even when the franchise takes a turn into a different street, it can still be enjoyable.",douglasc11,2025-01-03,2025
5.0,"This one is a little much, and deviates too much from the original","I like how they tried to tell a new story within the Fast and the Furious franchise, but this one goes a bit too far in trying to deliver on the action without the story to back it up. It just isn't the same with the main character being more of a loner than someone who teams up and is all about family. The cars aren't as good, the acting isn't as good, the story isn't as good. It is a fun watch if you are just looking for driving and action, but it doesn't go much further than that. It is still a big enough part of the franchise to put ""Tokyo Drift"" into our vernacular probably forever, but the re-watch of this one doesn't warrant a very high rating when compared to some other movies in the franchise.",jaredlemin,2025-01-08,2025
6.0,"Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift - Drifting, Clichés, and a Crash Course in Japanese","Sean Boswell, the undisputed king of crashing for no reason, gets shipped off to Japan like a faulty Amazon return. The guy arrives in Tokyo with all the finesse of an American tourist in socks and sandals. His mission? Lay low. What does he do instead? Finds the underground drifting scene and immediately forgets about staying out of trouble. It's like giving a GTA player a car and expecting them to follow traffic laws.Lucas Black as Sean is that guy from your high school who thinks he's cool because he can do donuts in the parking lot, but everyone knows he's one mistake away from wrapping his car around a tree. He tries to be the main character, but let's be real: his charisma is about as strong as a dying car battery. Han Lue, the real MVP, effortlessly steals the spotlight. Whenever Han's on screen, Sean might as well be a turn signal nobody's using.Justin Lin knows how to shoot Tokyo at night-neon lights, shadowy alleys, and a constant sense of danger lurking around every corner. But the most glowing thing here isn't the city or the cars-it's the clichés. We get it all: a bargain-bin romance, neighborhood rivalries, and women circling cars like they're waiting for a discount fashion shoot. Honestly, Mario Kart has more emotional depth.Where the film really shines is on the asphalt. The drifting scenes are filmed with so much care you can practically smell the burnt rubber. Justin Lin shows Michael Bay that you don't need a thousand explosions to create adrenaline-pumping action. The drifts are tight, the engines roar, and you're glued to your seat. But let's be clear: even the best car chases can't save a plot that barely fills a sticky note.As for the villain, DK (Drift King-seriously, who approved this?), he's a walking stereotype. The guy squints menacingly like he's either plotting Sean's downfall or struggling to read small text. The yakuza subplot? As threatening as overcooked sushi. You're never actually worried about Sean, because the whole thing is as predictable as sunrise.Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift is like grabbing McDonald's at 3 a.m.: you know it won't provide much substance, but it hits the spot for now. The drifting scenes are spectacular, but everything around them is as flat as a tire with a nail in it. Watch it once, appreciate Han's chill dominance, and forget the rest.",OniFR,2025-02-04,2025
