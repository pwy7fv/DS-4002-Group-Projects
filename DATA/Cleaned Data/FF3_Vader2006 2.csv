10.0,Definitely much better than Roper and Leno painted it!,"For one thing, the caption that identifies the jetliner as landing at Tokyo International Airport was very useful. Because, otherwise, ALL THAT SCENE SHOWED WAS A JETLINER LANDING! Something that could have been stock footage shot at some other airport, for some other movie, over the last twenty years. Secondly; the writers of this movie tell a completely new story (for the most part). No overseas assignment for FBI Agent Conner, the lead-footed undercover guy from the first two flicks. Nope! We get a whole new lead-foot, named Sean Boswell. A navy brat whose parents are divorced: the mom living in Texas. And, the dad living in Tokyo. The street-racing segment that gets Sean exiled to Japan is refreshingly realistic, with regard to the consequences (both medical and legal). So, too, is Sean's ‘fish-out-water’ feeling, during his first day in a school where English is REALLY a second language! That's where he meets Twinkie (an African-American army brat and Donald Trump wanna-be) And, through him, Han: a Chinese-American expatriate who is both rival and business partner of ‘DK’ Takashi (nephew of a local yakuza bigwig). The ‘Romeo and Juliet’ thing that develops between Sean and Neela (Takashi's half-gaijin girlfriend) is admittedly a little predictable. But, the way they start to get to know each other isn't any more far-fetched than, say, Ren McCormick and Ariel Shaw, in the deservedly classic ‘Footloose.’ Two strangers in a strange land, getting to know each other, and building up gradually, from there. But, the street-racing sequences are, of course, the main attraction. I admire the stunt doubles who REALLY handled the driving in those scenes! I certainly don't envy them, however. Especially, the climactic race down that Japanese mountain road. Hoo-boy! I swear: I got vertigo just WATCHING those shots of what waited just beyond each cliffside curve. I guess the only other thing I can say, in favor of this movie, is the uncredited cameo towards the end. You continuity addicts will love it. *Insert mischievous snickering here.*",Carycomic,2006-06-16,2006,0.022,0.899,0.08,0.9714,Positive
10.0,intense car chases leaving you on the edge of your seat!,"wow.. i had my thoughts about this movie.. i liked the first 1.. i watched half of the second one and i quite watching it half way in it.. and now were at the third one.. when it started i was like interesting. about not even 5 minutes in the movie, we see one of the many car chases/races that will leave you on the edge of your seat. for people that didn't think this movie had a story, it sure did, and it flowed good. the theathre was full and i don't think anyone left but i was too focused on the movie.. i can well say it was well worth the admission price. i highly recommend this for car racing fans or someone looking for a lot of action. 10/10!",video_game_lover_122,2006-06-16,2006,0.007,0.818,0.175,0.9663,Positive
10.0,Running in the 90's.,"Way better than the first two, though the lead actor had this mid-western accent which threw me off a little. Some of the drifting was unrealistic, but the storyline wasn't all hip-hop'd out with stupid walking styles and saying ‘breh’ and ‘brah’ at the end of every sentence. The Teriyaki boyz' theme song was good, the storyline was pretty good and the girls are hot of course. If anyone has seen the Initial D movie, then this movie is better than that one. There is a little love story kind of, but most of it is drifting action. Keiichi Tsuchiya (the real, one and only Drift King) makes an appearance in it as an old man fishing ‘You call that drifting?",blackdakkon,2006-06-16,2006,0.032,0.77,0.198,0.9756,Positive
10.0,this movie was off the hook it was better then the first 2,"The Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift not only contained evos, skylines and the vielside Mazda rx7 it contained a lot of hot girls and for u guys that like classic cars it contained that. The 67 mustang they supped up wit a skyline engine was crazy and i know everyone will fall in love with it. Also a great ending it just never stopped wit the action the whole audience was going crazy at the end wit Vin diesal return but its only for like 2 mins, but this movie u will be on the edge of ur seats. This one was much better then the 2nd movie and just a little bit better then the first but the lead actor black is the next Paul walker this movie rocked.",ballermm,2006-06-16,2006,0.04,0.83,0.13,0.9188,Positive
10.0,It was a great movie!,This movie was the best!! I am so going to buy it when it comes out! I think the writers of the movie should make many more of Fast and the Furious movies and the next 1 should have Paul Walker!!Vin Diesel! nd Lucas Black!!!!! all in the same movie. That would be so0o0 awesome nd it should be in Europe!!! That would be great!Well everybody told me they enjoyed this movie nd so did I. Well I really am going to be waiting for another one coming out.. with Lucas Black in it. Man was Lucas Black hot in this movie!!Well yea I'm really going to buy this movie without a doubt on my mind!I mean the cars were hot and everything was hot in this movie!,Dlife921,2006-06-16,2006,0.026,0.853,0.121,0.9266,Positive
5.0,decent,possible spoilers The whole movie was great until about the end. There was a good plot line and everything. then they take an American classic a early to late 70's ford mustang gt and put a Nissan engine in it. i realize some of you may not get this but i am the biggest fan of muscle cars. this pisses me off so much. i do not know what the hell they were thinking The main point of the movie though was good and the plot lines were done well. i do believe that they will do another movie to wrap up the series including Vin diesel and Dom torentto. i think that there idea of releasing a commerical ruined the surprise but there was a big competition between that and nacho libre.,Pschmeiser,2006-06-16,2006,0.091,0.792,0.117,-0.0065,Neutral
10.0,Beautiful Film,"At first, I wasn't sure how Justin Lin could pull off the whole drifting scene and make a story out of it. I went in with high hopes and left even happier. Lucas Black has another great performance in another great film. He has a bright future ahead of him. Every racing sequence in this film is amazingly done and is all real. In the first two films, you could notice that the racing sequences were all done on a computer. Here, you can tell it's really happening. I highly recommend that the car lovers should go see this film. Especially if you love drifting. I'm a fan of all types of racing and I loved this film. I know I'll be making another trip back to see it. Also, the first racing sequence is AMAZING. It's pretty accurate to how a race could start. I give this film, a 9 out of 10.",fenderbass2122,2006-06-16,2006,0.011,0.763,0.227,0.9912,Positive
10.0,Blew Me Away,"There is no doubt that automobile racing is becoming an obsession in many parts of the world, including Japan, it seems. Tokyo is a city full of lights and music and also a dark side, including gangsters and reckless racers, much like the untamed America of the prohibition era. Lucas Black, a rebellious Alabama teen racer, is sent to his father in Tokyo to settle down. Instead, Lucas learns the sport of ""drift racing"" from Japanese gangster youth in which racers use spinning tires and their brakes to make fast turns around the curves of parking garages and mountain roads. Those who aspire to win smiles from the foxy Japanese girls and the admiration of Japanese males have to win these drifting contests. Despite a steep learning curve, young Lucas does not disappoint in this matter. This movie has superb photography of the beautiful people and stirring landscapes of Tokyo. The exciting action and inspiring music have to be experienced to be believed. The ensemble of young men and women does a great job of providing a glimpse of this advanced culture of modern Japanese youth, overflowing with style and passion. This movie skillfully shows off modern Japan as perhaps a neglected subject of cinema. And, the well-crafted and intricate plot is full of teenage rivalry and violence, similar to an updated ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" very fascinating and passionate.",phillipstephenso,2006-06-16,2006,0.059,0.744,0.197,0.9892,Positive
1.0,Disappointing to say the least.,"For being an American movie on a Japanese concept, I first expected it to be a mess. But after checking out the movie website I saw that they did some homework, so I had moderate-low expectations going in. And with those expectations, I was rather disappointed. It was no Shuto Kousoku Trial and I'm well surprised that Keiichi Tsuchiya dared have anything to do with it.For starters the dialogue was terrible generic canned phrases all through the movie, but that was to be expected of a mainstream Hollywood production. Most notably would have to be the camera work which is the choppiest work I've ever seen done. In an attempt to make scenes more dramatic and appear faster than they were, the fast camera movement only wound up leaving the viewer with mere pieces of what was going on, rather than conveying an actual scene; it wasn't styled either, it was just bad. Even for being obviously low budget (canned dialogue, little scenery, etc.) the plot was clearly quite formulaic and the main character simply embarrassing to watch. I don't even want to start on the hair-thin plot and unnecessary sexualization. Maybe I've just grown out of that junk.There were, however, two or three good (yet painfully brief) scenes that just had a good feeling to the way they were done (like they kept the camera still for more than a second and combined elements like plot and environment). Also, the character Han is fantastic in his Japanese manner of doing things, but his character is ruined by two significant events, the first of which is something he does that is unfortunately way out of character. That's what brings this movie up to a 3/10 rating for me.",soulshinobi,2006-06-16,2006,0.11,0.796,0.094,-0.7378,Negative

5.0,Eye Candy just like the other 2,"Fun, Fast and Flashy. Like the other 2 it mostly ignores physics and completely ignores common sense. The drifting is cool but better in person with real professionals. I think a good half of the drifting in this was CG. Hell there was more ""real"" drifting in the Dukes of Hazard remake.Finally I think the most annoying part was during the major chase through Tokyo none of these drivers ""drove"" to get away. Drifting is NOT the fastest way through a corner, so if your running from someone why would you drift.Any way, I enjoyed it but if you like cars or racing, and have a average understanding of both, your gonna be shaking your head a lot.",Physicker,2006-06-16,2006,0.11,0.743,0.147,0.6444,Positive
10.0,The fats and the furious Tokyo drift,"I saw fast and the furious Tokyo drift today it was an excellent movie and i'd love to see it again. It did include Vin Diesel although he wasn't a main character it least the director tried to include him. The cars were gorgeous and i thought while i was watching it i want to be like them i want to be a car racer. Which i've always wanted to do but now i want to be a racer even more. Of course these films must influence people like me to want to be like them and race cars and drift. But also it makes you change your mind as Han, Shawns friend dies in it which made me want to cry. He died when they were racing and D.K was racing after them. Then the car was burning and Shawn was walking up to it and it exploded. This was the saddest part of the movie. The movie was fantastic and when i buy it on DVD i'm probably going to be up watching it every night! They had fantastic cars in the movie my favourite was the Nissan 350Z which D.K at the beginning of the movie drove. The cars were gorgeous and when i'm 17 i'm going to have my driving test in a Nissan 350Z on my birthday. To sum the movie up it was a brilliant movie and there was some gorgeous guys and cars. Also the music was great and i hope they bring out a soundtrack for the film. Lucas Black was always fantastic in this movie as well as Nathalie Kelley i hope the next one comes out soon and the DVD comes out soon because i want to watch it every day. I also hope Lucas Black and Nathalie Kelley are in the next ones. Also Lucas Black seemed more tough then Paul Walker. Thankyou for your co-operation. If you have not yet seen the movie. SEE IT!!!

5.0,eh...,"if you like minimum plot concern, tricked-out cars, Japan, Japanese mafia, Japanese girls(Harijuku girls especially) and drift racing... go for it. the oldest kid from the Home Imporvement sitcom makes his first appearance since First Kid as a cocky jock, i thought that was worth a good chuckle in the theater. too many special effects, half of them were in there for suspense... but they weren't so believable if you've watched drift racing. there was one chase scene where they skidded through traffic and inbetween cars... to me it felt that they tried to push a whole lot of drift racing into some of the action scenes.",sketchbook_romance,2006-06-16,2006,0.011,0.909,0.08,0.6808,Positive
8.0,Better than 1 and 2,"It's easy to beat 2, so that isn't saying much. However, in my mind it is even better than the first. Neither necessarily has a great storyline, though number 1 had the most likely one. However, where the first one failed, Tokyo Drift delivers.People don't go see movies like this for substance and content. They go to see cars race. Autophiles and racers go to see the tricked out cars and hear the names of their suppliers being used on the big screen. The first installment in this series used a lot a jargon unknown to non to non-racers, and to those who were in the know, the movie was a joke. Tokyo Drift gets away from all the pretenses and delivers what the truth is: few people use Nitrous Oxide, and racers drive because they love it, money or none, just to see who is the best.The cars are great. It was wonderful too see the makes and models you are used to seeing out there, instead of all these tricked out high priced rice racers. The best cars to race aren't necessarily the most expensive. The racing was more about skill than power, and that's the truth. First off the line means jack if you don't know your wheels. The racing scenes are top notch. Gone are the shaky camera angles and digitally enhanced shots of cars flying by at 140mph with nitrous in full bore. Instead, we get cool shots using cell phones, and up close angles of vehicles gliding across pavement and narrowly missing the camera. The action shots are wonderful, and many are real shots, not computer digitized as referenced by the end credits begging us not to go out and attempt these stunts that were performed on closed roads by professional drivers. We're not talking your standard danger tag, we're talking full size text on it's own screen. These drifters are for real, and that just enhances the feel for the film.Finally, and parents will love this, it is relatively clean. I don't think i heard a single f-bomb in the whole movie. I'm not saying that there is no cussing, but that it is so moderate and background oriented, that you can watch the movie and not even remember hearing it. There are about 5 or 6 kissing scenes, and only one contains a semi-main character. The worst content you will see here is skimpy outfits.This is just a fun, fun movie. It's not going to win any awards, but it has definitely set itself up to top the original in box office gross and will no doubt surpass 2 fast 2 furious. Don't be afraid to take the 13+ kidding to see this, though under 8-10 may be pushing it, unless they really understand cars and racing.",deac0n_fr0st,2006-06-16,2006,0.061,0.812,0.127,0.9807,Positive
9.0,Good movie elevated by awesome action.,"This movie has to be the most entertaining thing i have seen all year even though i still think the first one was better. But moving it to Tokyo was a smart move as this brings a fresh atmosphere. Some of the acting was terrible but what do you expect. Lucas Black is a likable replacement for Paul Walker and Bow Wow does okay. Some of the Japanese actors are really good, but the real stars are the cars and boy do they look good, they go from show ponies - twink's car to awesome drift cars- Han's car. The action sidepieces are totally amazing the action goes from good to great through the movie.

What did you think it was going to be? Some great racing scenes. This could have easily just been another racing for cash film, but it actually was smart in pulling in the drift scene. Same cars, but different style of racing.Overall I thought the characters were fun. Again, nothing high concept here. Just enough info for you to separate the good guys and bad guys. Throw in a little romance and there you have the formula that made the other two films in this franchise hits.",RCWjr,2006-06-17,2006,0.063,0.787,0.15,0.9163,Positive
3.0,"Lackluster plot, brainless bimbos, & Some Rotten Acting","Well I never had the intention to see this movie, but my friend who has no taste in movies implored me to accompany him to this movie that promises to bring in a marginally slim profit. So a disrespectful adolescent is sentenced to go to his father who lives in Tokyo when he is apprehended by the local police when he decimates a construction site. For reasons I do not know, he was not incarcerated, apparently he can just be relocated. In Japan he in pulled into the ‘underground’ of competitive racing that incorporates a technique called drifting, I suppose no one on the continent of North America had ever had the notion of drifting before. So then while he is in this strange land he falls for the girl who's boyfriend is the nephew of the don of the Yakuza. Uh-OH, bit trouble! There's animosity, so how does it get resolved? By the means of a race! The race sequences are intriguing at first, but later they just become repetitive and use an endless string of shots that just disorientate the audience to create the cheap illusion of insane speed. The dialog isn't too much too look at, I almost died when the cliché of ‘let's end this once and for all’ was used to prompt the ‘final showdown’. Something else that I could not wrap my mind around is that the girls are not only flat out promiscuous in this renegade's dreamland, but also that they can be one over something as trivial as a car race. The director did a decent job, but a lot of his techniques were pretty minimalistic. But perhaps the most annoying aspect of this movie was the southern hick accent that was laid on pretty thick by Lucas Black. All in all, this is just going to be one of those movies that will fade into the obscurity of Action section in the back of Blockbuster video. If you want to walk away from a movie and feel fulfilled, just wait for Superman Returns and save yourself $7.50",boxybrown13,2006-06-17,2006,0.085,0.806,0.109,0.913,Positive
8.0,It is a very entertaining movie.,"OK, I walked in expecting another fake street racing movie. The first Fast and the Furious was quite entertaining. The second just felt like a 90 minute commercial sponsored by Mitsubishi and Yearone. Honestly, this movie was really great, it felt really good to watch. You can really connect with the main character(Lucas Black). I dunno, you can sense a lot of sincerity in his character. He loves what he does and thats it. The jump from drag to drifting doesn't seem to really get to him. The fact that this movie doesn't rely on the cars as the main characters is really great. The acting itself in this movie was wonderful. I love watching a good classic movie just like the rest, but sometimes you just need to see some mindless car scenes and unwind a bit. Oh, the other thing I loved was the cameos! We have the original drift king with his one liners. Funny. We also have the so ever popular Sonny Chiba(aka the swordsman from Kill Bill).

9.0,Absolutely Awesome,"If you liked either of the previous Fast and Furious movies, see this movie. If you like cars, see this movie. If you like hot girls, see this movie. I'll grant that the plot isn't super intensive, but the mix of plot intertwined with action was great. I think that the 2 Fast 2 Furious plot of 'cops and drugs' has been used a little too much, and yet that movie still had redeeming features. I don't know why there is so many people who think it wasn't worth the money. Lets face it. There are VERY few movies that have: great plots, Awesome action, and very hot chicks. I watch movies a lot and i have only seen - at most - 5 movies that have the above content. It also depends on the viewer and their preferences. If your confused about whether you want to see Tokyo Drift or not, my advice is to ignore what anybody says about it and to just go and watch it for yourself and decide whether it was or wasn't worth it.",mutated_carcass,2006-06-17,2006,0.094,0.785,0.122,0.7832,Positive

When i went to see it I thought it was the best of the lot. I thought the first race was equally as good as the last. I found with the other 2 the attention moved off the races and onto other things e.g. Carlos Verone, Monica Vuentas and Mia Toretto. I personally thought the twist at the end with Dom was a perfect ending despite not actually seeing the race. I have also found out the connection between Han and Torretto. After Dom's brief with Letty in Mexico they returned to California where Johnny Trent's car gang was falling apart and then Han transfered from johnny to Dominic where they raced for about a year. Thats about when Han returned to japan and Dom went around the time Shaun beat D.K. (The Japanese version of Justin Timberlake).",gedders2006,2006-06-17,2006,0.043,0.88,0.078,0.802,Positive

Another thing...Shawn Boswell was a great actor but his country southern accent seemed too fake. It seemed like he was 'trying to hard' if you know what I mean. Last thing for now...Vin Diesel's appearance was not needed. It was just really stupid how he just showed up for 10 seconds!

If the movie happened to be decent, well then that would just be a bonus. Boy was I pleasantly surprised at how good this film was! This movie is pure entertainment. The cinematography is gorgeous, and really reveals Tokyo as a futuristic city. The racing scenes are amazing. The character development is there, and you actually are intrigued by the main characters. There is plenty of eye candy to go around. I was gripped the whole time by this movie.

Well I went in with very very low expectations and walked thinking it wasn't too bad. It was an o.k. overdone action movie I'll give it that. The acting was quite cheesy and the movie itself was predictable. But at the same time it did have some very nice(nice, not possible) racing scenes that I did enjoy. Another thing was that I totally didn't feel the fast and the furious ""feeling"" throughout this one, as I did during the first two. It just doesn't quite follow the same theme and guidelines.

10.0,what this film should be judged on,This is first and foremost an action film you do not watch it for the characters and story you watch it for the action and for the thrills and in this aspect the fast and furious tokyo drift definitely delivers. The action scenes have a real sense of speed. They also give you a real sense of danger and you never know what is coming next.It also contains some very nice cars i am not really into the Japanese tuning seen but this film contains every kind of car from nissans to mustangs to volkswagens there really is something for everyone!In conclusion if you want a film with in depth story and characters look elsewhere but if you want a good thrilling action movie then the fast and the furious tokyo drift is certainly worth watching.,gavin_2003,2006-06-18,2006,0.062,0.795,0.143,0.8654,Positive

The lack of reasonable plot and plot holes spoiled it.As a Navy brat that lived in Japan when I was a kid, I for a fact know that Navy kids do not attend Japanese schools, they attend American schools. Navy officers do not live in shacks in Tokyo, they live on the base, because they get big houses for 25% of the price. In Tokyo drift they do neither of these things. I'm almost 100% sure that the Yakuza have no interest whatsoever in drifting. They'd prefer to be making money. I'm also sure that not every drift car in Japan is sponsored and covered with stickers. As a person who is/was pasionate about the sport of drifting, the way this movie portrayed it was a joke. Basically this was another attempt by Hollywood to grab onto pop culture and warp it to their ends to make money.

Nacho just tried to hard to be some clever indie movie, and frankly all those dirty-nerdy temptations from childhood were already explored in Dynamite and are now best left hidden away in the past. Nacho tried to be something. But something it was not. And with it's cast and ""pret-indie"" (my term so y'all better give me credit) look, it wasn't even an indie flick.If I had to put the two side by side in a race, my 10 bucks would be on Tokyo Drift. It's a good movie for the big screen. Wait for Nacho to come out on video, so you ""walk out of the movie"" without feeling bad about having gone to the theater.Despite the previews, there's nothing redeeming about Jack Black flexing his buttocks in those white pants.

8.0,Does what you expect,"Alright, let's get this out of the way: if you have no interest in cars, don't bother. If you want moving, powerful acting performances, look elsewhere. If blow-off valves and spinning tires make your heart shift into high gear, this is your kind of movie. The story is wafer-thin, it serves only as a hasty explanation to bring the audience to the Tokyo location and set up some action addicted races. The acting is just decent enough to keep you from groaning constantly, though Sung Kang's role as Han stands out as memorable and pleasant. Lucas Black has an understated quality about him that I think allows the movie's merit of its stunt sequences to shine, rather than the lead trying to steal all the attention. Which leaves me with the car play--the writers thankfully stopped trying to be technical and accurate in terms or facts (for the most part), so there's no ""...Blow the welds on your intake..."" crap, which is just plain wrong. The stunt drivers delivered lots of jaw-dropping drifts and high octane chases, and Justin Lin and his second-unit director took great care in highlighting the automotive lunacy. The cars and the setting are all glossy and colorful, and there is a wide range of makes and models to drool over, all just a bit over the top in their appearance. The music matches the speed of the movie as well, getting the target audience fired up with rock, hip-hop, and electronic tracks in all the right spots. Simply put, this movie offers what it promises, and gets by on the rest. I'm one of those types who can look past the shortcomings for the vehicular excitement, so I loved it, despite the flaws.",carlsob,2006-06-18,2006,0.059,0.812,0.129,0.9685,Positive
6.0,Give it a chance...,I'm giving this a 10 because it was SO MUCH BETTER than I thought it would be. I didn't think I could get past Lucas Black's heavy accent. He toned it down to a believable one that didn't get in the way of the story.This film moves quickly and doesn't stray too long on dialog and kissy-face. (Was there any?) The folks that gave this movie a 1 out of 10 obviously didn't see and don't like the franchise and feel that they can bash a movie in 10 lines or more and feel better about it. Those people should just go watch South Park and stop whining. This movie is entertainment in the purest form. I will see it again in the theaters soon.,wilkinsd-1,2006-06-18,2006,0.045,0.86,0.095,0.8299,Positive
6.0,"Not award winning material, but decent.","Lets get one thing clear, you are not going to a Fast and Furious movie for the groundbreaking plot and acting, you go for the cars, the racing, and the babes. Tokyo Drift is basically the same if not a little better than the previous two as far as the racing is concerned. There is the street racing that the series is famous for but also the addition of drift racing, which adds a new bit of spice to the flavor. As I mentioned the acting and the plot are so so at best, not something you will be groaning over but not enough to really drag you in and connect you with the characters. However it is my opinion that the plot here is better than in the second movie. Lucas Black from Friday night Lights replaces Paul Walker as the main character here, and Bow Wow is along for the ride as the trusty friend/sidekick. A few cameos from other actors and movies are thrown in as well. From beginning to end this movie does hold your interest with the racing, and for that the weak plot and questionable acting can be forgiven. Cars get wrecked, punches get thrown, loud music is played, and the hero has to do what he thinks is right. Bottom line, if you enjoyed the previous two, or even enjoy car racing movies at all you should get some entertainment value out of this one. Not the best movie to ever grace the silver screen, but I had a good time.",madmax_thegamer,2006-06-18,2006,0.057,0.745,0.199,0.9939,Positive
5.0,the fast and the furious Tokyo drift,"i saw the fast and the furious. the movie is not really as great as it is supposed to be. The main character, sounds like Cletus, the slack jawed yokel. There are moments in the movie where the director intends some scenes to be very powerful and emotional but the performances, given by the actors are mediocre and average at best. Unless you are total rev - head fan and would like to sit through all the unconvincing performances for nearly two hours just to see the cars, then this is the movie for you. if you are someone who likes to actively engage with the story, forget this movie and save your money. The other thing that is wrong with this movie is that they cast bow wow as the sidekick. he is just as bad as the will smith and the martin Lawrence partnership in bad boys 2. the one notable exception are the two characters, drift king and Han - who serves as a mentor for our friend. who incidentally looks like he has been hit with a shovel",pinapati2,2006-06-18,2006,0.09,0.716,0.193,0.9733,Positive
4.0,"Not Much Of A Movie, Although Lucas Black Is Good.","Let me be honest and say I saw this film solely because Lucas Black was in it. I like his tough look and sweet Alabama drawl, but despite his presence and a couple of good driving stunts, this is a nothing movie. It's reminiscent of the ‘Stock Car Race’ movies from film companies like American International Pictures that were commonplace when I was a kid. While I am usually willing to do it, too much suspension of disbelief was expected of me for my own enjoyment. Lucas Black is about 24; he cannot play a seventeen year old. The story of the film would still have worked if Sean, (Black's character) was his real chronological age. They could even have used the same plot device of him wrecking a housing development in an illegal race and that is why he's sent to stay with his dad in Japan instead of going to jail. But to pretend that Sean is 17 is just dumb. Nobody would give that much credence to a 17 year old no matter how tough. The ‘Tokyo Drift’ part is also kind of dumb. It seems to be a driving stunt wherein you propel the car forward in a sideways position. This is used to a fun effect with the drivers getting to the top of a parking garage and all, but this ‘drifting’ as it's called I have seen before in stock car races. I've seen it in James Bond movies and in last years The Dukes Of Hazard movie. In fact, ‘drifting’ is the whole major plot point in the Pixar film Cars and in Owen Wilson's inability to do it well. In fact, watching the drifting in The Dukes Of Hazard was better because it was filmed with longer shots. Director Justin Lin does too much MTV style quick cutting and it gets annoying. That kind of rapid cutting really only works in limited doses, it is tiring over the length of a feature film. Besides, in The Dukes Of Hazard, I had the feeling that the stunt people were actually driving the cars, in this its one cut after another and you don't get any sense of the cars being driven. The scene where about ten cars come ‘drifting’ down a mountain road is cool, but the story is still dumb. Too bad, I really want to see Lucas Black in something better. There is something very attractive and real about him that has yet to be tapped. He has a no nonsense demeanor that could work very well on screen, like a cross between Charles Bronson and Jimmy Stewart. I know that sounds like an odd mix, but I think it can work. I think he can be a star, even though that might not be what he wants.",Michael-70,2006-06-18,2006,0.093,0.799,0.108,0.8402,Positive
9.0,From someone who has reviewed more than ONE movie ever,"I'm not sure why this movie didn't spark the interest that the other FATF movies did but I think this is the best one of the three. The cinematography was awesome, the women are gorgeous. The villain was believable, it has almost non-stop action, and some genuinely funny lines. I never believe any reviews from anyone that has only reviewed one movie because they obviously have an agenda in either over hyping or needlessly trashing a movie. What I don't understand is why isn't anyone putting legitimate critiques up of this movie. The weakest point in this movie is trying to swallow that a guy w/ a southern accent could so instantly be accepted and trusted in a prominent drift club in Tokyo. OK suspend that disbelief and this move MOVES! I never once felt bored or lost or clicked my tongue and rolled my eyes like I did in the last FATF movie. Maybe people were hoping for more of the same trash, I'm not sure but this is an above average, I'd even say exciting, summer race film not like many others. I hope this sparks some other real reviews.",yoncenator,2006-06-18,2006,0.101,0.687,0.212,0.9867,Positive
8.0,The Best Thus Far,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift took me by complete surprise. The movie completely redeemed the series following the Too Fast, Too Furious fiasco. Although the movie does not contain the appealing American muscle cars of the first title, the eloquent interpretation of drifting as a racing style (art form)and the culmination of turbo charged 350 Z's and RX7's,lets the picture differ from the typical concept of headstrong American drag racing. Decent acting and an even better storyline, allows the viewer to embrace the techniques in Japanese underground racing. Plus, Vin Diesel's cameo is ridiculously bad ass.",irishprd88,2006-06-18,2006,0.143,0.731,0.127,-0.4417,Negative
8.0,It was better than the second one but not as good as the first,OK this is for the comment above about the navy brat ! For a start neither of them was a navy brat. Shaun was sent to Tokyo to avoid going to jail back in the states. I agree that the plot was rather terrible but apart from that it was good. Japs invented drifting so i think you are wrong mate. The only thing that was wrong with this film was that it didn't have a wide enough range of cars that it could of done like the previous ones. All you saw was 350 z and a skyline now and then. Don't get me wrong the s15 (which was actually a s13 that had been converted) was rather nice but a bit pathetic when he opened the hood and you saw the s13 engine ha ha. The Evo was rather nice and the Rx7. What was with Bow Wows car man. WTF Wat that ha ha. Rite mess. But overall worth watching. I personally think they could have done a better job or maybe even relate it to the previous ones. But no they had to do this.

10.0,Lucas Black is a hit in new Fast and Furious flick,"I enjoyed watching this new movie of The Fast and The Furious. Lucas Black seemed to capture the spotlight in the movie. His character's background was entertaining. The ending is unexpected, but INTERESTING.Great movie.The only disadvantage of the movie is the storyline seems to drift off occasionally. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone that is into fast paced movies and also into the auto aspect. Nicer cars compared to the first to movies. No subtitles, which makes the movie, slightly confusing but you'll get the gist of it all.The trailer didn't do the movie any justice.

10.0,Much better than 2fast,This movie was far better than 2fast 2furious. Thankfully the ditched the tired storyline of an undercover cop in this one. This time around it's about a kid that just wants to race. The plot isn't amazing but at least its fresh and not the same tired movie with new race scenes.(2fast 2furious). The movie gets off to a banging start with a race with in the first five minutes. The racing scenes in this one are the best of the series. I thought the characters in this movie were great too. While not as gritty and mean as the characters from the previous movies they do stand out well. I especially liked bow wows character. So basically if you liked the first movie or even the second then you should love this one. I don't know why some people are giving it bad reviews and scores.

5.0,like a book amongst the many on the shelf,"The Fast and the Furious,first movie, was okay. I'm not a big VD fan.Too Fast Too Furious was surprisingly very entertaining. Both Walker and his co-star did a good job. With Tokyo Drift, Walker is gone and in comes 24 year old, Lucas Black with Bow Wow (Mr. yawn-fest) The first fifteen or so minutes of this film are wild. Sean(the lead) is sent to Tokyo so that he can avoid himself getting into trouble. In Tokyo, he meets Bow Wow and they become good friends quickly to get the story to move along. Of course, there is a girl in it but never mind, just imagine a movie based on semi-entertaining drifts and soppy story lines and somewhat cheesy characters.This is not a bad film. It's just that I expected them to raise the bar. The soundtrack is decent and the music will make you tap your feet while you sit in the theater.Overall, I'd say the film is watchable if you do not expect very good actions. The villain could have been made to look cooler than what they did make him look like. The Japanese should love this film. Not the best camera-work in the film though. The sets are below average for an action packed film of this genre.Anyhow, watch it if you must. I would watch it if I read my own review for it's worth watching.

7.0,Like finding a pristine Z in the garage with a seized engine...,"First, I am a car guy. So at least one of those stars is simply from the fact that it's a car movie with good vehicle exposure. That being said, I went into it thinking I'd see a weak attempt at milking the franchise, and was pleasantly surprised to find a plot, character, and development. FF3 has it's warts, but it ain't half bad and I'd recommend it to anyone into the car scene. Now for those warts. First and foremost, the car racing scenes are gratuitous and CGI'd: it's a movie though, people, so get over it. They look cool, even if in some cases, whomever was responsible should be taken out and flogged. The laws of physics *can* be obeyed and still permit the production of a good racing scene. Acting was excellent, which has always impressed me in this franchise where I expect something more along the line of Mischief 3000. So kudos to casting and directing. The plot in this (no spoilers!) is weaker than a head gasket on a 1960 'vette been in a barn rotting for 30+ years. And what makes it worse is it didn't have to be. Hire me, boys, I can fix your flaws! But still not so weak I couldn't watch it. I am not appreciative of the plot vehicles they are using to draw these people together, though. You do not have to bring the movie down by utilizing undersirable character flaws. Seriously, call me, I'll walk you through how to make a better movie without the weak plot. The hunnies are nice, but barely adequate to anyone who's attended a good car show. They need more camera time. The lead actress Nathalie Kelley is fiiiiiiiine. But she got enough time. The cars were the real loss on this one. No time was spent in even cursory discussion about what chassis, what engine, what tweaks. That's why we come, boys, to see the cars. There are some really nice cars, just not a lot of time spent on them. I couldn't even identify a couple they were so modded, and that's a shame. Going to have to buy the DVD with the extras disc to find out more, I suppose. All in all, more fuel for gear heads.

9.0,Definite Improvement Over the First Two Films,"Being an automotive enthusiast, (and a movie buff) for over 10 years now, I've always been one of the first in line to see the F and F movies when they came out. This movie was no exception. However, after being disappointed with the first two films, I didn't expect much from this third installment. The first two films satisfied my need for hot cars, women, and so-so action scenes, but I felt that the acting, dialog, and story lines were very thin and boring. F and F Tokyo Drift was much better than I had anticipated. It seems that the director (Justin Lin) actually concentrated more on the acting skill of the actors and dramatic aspects of the film, than he did on showing off the cars. That's where the first two installments fell short. It was also great to see the drift culture in this film, in addition to the show and drag-race culture that we were exposed to in the first two films. I've never been to Japan, but from what I have experienced in the U.S., I felt that the film did a pretty good job of depicting the key elements of the drift culture to the audience. Of course there were a few of the usual over-the-top stunts and scenes, but it's to be expected in a Hollywood picture. If it were exactly true to life, it would just be a documentary. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised and entertained, and I think that if you even somewhat enjoyed the first two, you will definitely love F and F Tokyo Drift. Even if you're not into cars and/or the whole tuner culture, the movie is still entertaining and a fun ride.",dchampagne-2,2006-06-20,2006,0.026,0.805,0.169,0.9944,Positive

I was kind of getting sick and tired of the same Nitros powered vehicles / rims bigger than the door of their cars, and it's drivers wanting to just go straight and think that's the best.

7.0,Fast Furious Tokyo Drift,"Let me start out by saying ""why god why did you let the second movie in this series happen"". Paul ""douchebag"" Walker's acting in both of the first two movies was on par with the acting skills of a retarded kitten on mescaline. The first movie was made by Vin Diesel alone. The second movie was dead in the water when Vin Deisel left, killed by Paul Walker, but Tyrese and Ludicrous were the nails in the coffin. Needless to say, I formed a discrimination against musicians in movies. (Mos Def in anything*) But in Tokyo Drift, Lil Bow-Wow was surprisingly good in his role as Twinkie, although several gay jokes always followed his name being said. I'm glad to say that, although Lucas Black left something to be desired, like more emotion, his southern drawl is fitting for the farm boy classic American aspect of the main character. There are a HELL of a lot of Japanese people in this movie. NOT racist, just sayin. After all, it IS Japan... If you've never seen drifting and you like cars go see this movie. When this movie comes out on DVD I will be buying it and adding it to my collection. Many people may disagree with me because of a thin plot, etc but this movie strikes a place in my heart that loves drifting. And calling Lil Bow Wow twink. The Fast and the Furious; Tokyo Drift gets: 6/10 for creativity. 3/10 for romance. 9/10 for racing sequences. 10/10 for having a 25 year old play a high schooler(Zachary Ty Bryan).total 7/10 * Coincidentally mos def does a song on the soundtrack.

1.0,Utterly worthless waste of time and money,"TFATF is THE most pointless and artistically redundant franchise in history! The first, which was a total piece of crap, gave way to a tepid, moronic sequel and now, after three years of peace and quiet we are punished with Tokyo Drift. The most American Japan you will ever see in a film! Although there is even less of a story than the other two (if that's possible) it is still a carbon copy of its predecessors and offers absolutely nothing new. The characters are crap! The action is lame, soulless, overcut and PG13-friendly and is obviously 'inspired' by hours and hours of endless Playstation.The only reason I went to see this turkey is because I LOVE Japanese girls. But, like I said, this is the most American Japan you will ever see, so there is hardly any of them at all. And all Japanese girls are shot from behind so you can't actually see that they're Japanese. Whether or not this is because they are just LA girls masquerading as Japanese Girls or it's because Universal didn't want to alienate American audiences I don't know. But if you're expecting anything remotely resembling a culture clash then ditch that preconception. I guess that kind of thing would be too difficult for the writers of this trash to muster. And how the hell does hillbilly main character Sean Boswell master the Japanese language in a few days? It's no secret that TFATF films operate on a declining scale. And, forgive me for sounding like a fuddy-duddy, I feel that they send the wrong message to the wrong generation.Speed gets you babes. Speed gets you babes. Speed gets you babes. Speed gets you babes. Speed gets you babes. Speed gets you babes. Speed gets you babes. Speed gets you babes.The film is even less subtle than the above paragraph. Despite the disclaimer at the end, warning naive audience members of the dangers of such driving (such people cannot read anyway and left as soon as the screen went black) I must point out that too many impressionable kids forget this is just a stupid fantasy movie.

5.0,The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is far better than I expected - but I had low expectations. Enjoyable but not critically appealing,"I was quite surprised by The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift. Of course, I expected it to be a pile of steaming garbage, particularly with the formula of increasingly dodgy sequels. So when I went to see it with some friends, I had obvious misgivings. These misgivings, or at least the worst ones, such as the movie being unbearable to even look at, were fortunately unfounded. I kept my eyes on the movie the whole time, mainly because of the souped cars, but the fact that I went through the movie without flinching (a lot, except at some of the bad dialogue that was prevalent), says quite a lot. Maybe my view of The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift is heightened by the fact that I cracked a few jokes during the movie.Now down to business. Sean, a 'dude' who loves to race at high speeds for no apparent reason, is sent to Tokyo to live with his military dad and ends up being drawn to the racing circuit again, witnessing a new style of race called 'drift' (as seen in Need For Speed Underground, to those that don't know). Sounds stupid? Well, it is, the casual viewer can detect a plothole or two from even reading those two lines. To go on, except to state that Sean ends up making friends with a guy named Han, is pointless. I will admit that no-one looks for a good plot in a Fast and the Furious movie, but still, the less said, the better.The dialogue, as I stated, can be funny - because of its stupidity. This is shown by one piece of dialogue where some guy asks Sean: ""You know what DK stands for?"" and Sean replies ""Donkey Kong"". At least its original, I guess.The acting is OK - far from turgid, which I expected it to be in the first place. The guy who plays Han is surprisingly good, going through the movie without looking as if he was hired from a nearby sushi bar. Brian Tee as DK is a bit of a joke, he is more comedic than menacing. Lucas Black is OK as Sean, but his Southern accent makes his character more irritating to watch. The love interest does well as eye candy. That's about all that matters I guess.The most important part of The Fast and the Furious is inarguably the racing sequences and their overall effectiveness. I will admit that the sequences themselves are well-filmed and eye catching, highlighting the cars, as they should. However, except in a few fleeting moments, they are not as enthralling as they should be and this is one of the most disappointing aspects of The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift. The final confrontation, for me, is pretty good to watch, but only arouses the senses once in a while.Time didn't drag though, which is a clear sign that The Fast and Furious is indeed quite watchable, despite its other pre-eminent faults. I admit that I didn't really get bored during the film, which may lead to my rose-tinted view of it (compared to my original perception of what it would be like).So let me summarise my thoughts: ""Didn't expect much, got more than I bargained for."" The acting is satisfactory (for a racing film, otherwise it would more or less suck), the plot and the dialogue are predictably terrible, the racing sequences are satisfactory and the cinematography is somewhat effective, with frequent close-ups of the cars. What compels me to give The Fast and The Furious a pass grade is the fact that it is, like I said, quite watchable. However, it is still little more than satisfactory, so it's rating cannot therefore rise above:2.5/5 stars",DaRick89,2006-06-20,2006,0.096,0.749,0.155,0.989,Positive
6.0,Better than the previous,"Enter the life of Shawn Boswell, a college student with a manic taste for car racing. After numerous counts of traffic offenses, his mother decides to shift him to Tokyo as a last resort to live in with his divorced dad after the last count of traffic offense could see him in jail if he was tried as an adult. However things in Tokyo didn't really change much in terms of illegal racing for Shawn except where racing is done in drifting style. Somewhat curious and somewhat enthusiastic with this new genre of racing, Shawn takes on the challenge of becoming the next Drifting King.Walking into this movie, I had not much anticipation of a great film, since it was apparent to me that even Paul Walker did not sign to this film and Lucas Black, who plays the lead role wasn't actually a familiar name in Hollywood. My hunch was about right, the film did not provide the kind of intensity I'd love to see in a racing film. However the movie itself isn't that bad on given the Hollywood special effects added to it. The real letdown of this film to me was for most part of the racing, which was done in drifting style, the cinematography captured the facial expression of the actors instead of highlighting the race which is deemed necessary if you want to exhilarate the audience. Very unlike in the first installment where we were treated with the cars being driven at dangerous speeds. But all wasn't that bad, since the movie did have it's funny moments and thrilling scenes. I especially enjoyed the first few minutes of the film before the hero was moved to Tokyo and also where Vin Diesel makes a cameo appearance at the ending.Overall the film was a lot better than the second installment which i believe was the worst in the franchise. Also a note to film goers who prefer drama based genre, really not the kind of movie u'd like to watch, since the plot was paper thin and kind of ludicrous if you really think about it.",HypercriticalHangdog,2006-06-20,2006,0.046,0.839,0.115,0.977,Positive
10.0,"Opening Boring, But Rest Awesome","I saw this movie in theaters recently and I highly recommend it. Though the opening makes the movie seem cheesy and boring (it doesn't open with a race as usual, but instead with high school kids walking through a metal detector), after the beginning, it is awesome. I would recommend watching it in a theater with friends, and maybe even buying it when it comes out on DVD. It is definitely worth the money, delivering the same levels of excitement as the first two movies. All the actors are new to this series, but they are excellent actors (and pretty darn cute!). Japanese culture is presented very well, with the girls wearing the latest trends, using the latest Japanese music, and even accurately representing small things, such as school dress codes. The surprise cameo at the end (not telling who!) makes the movie all he more interesting and leaves you wanting to see more.",peacebe_dajourney,2006-06-20,2006,0.009,0.735,0.256,0.994,Positive
1.0,May have spoilers but who cares this movie blows.,"Coming into the theater I had no hope for this movie. The first 2 were horrible and I was dragged to see this one. There are two ways to portray this movie, 1: as a joke, or 2: ""awesome"". People who do not understand what makes a ""good"" movie will love this film. First off, acting yes, was horrible from the beginning and especially to the end. Second problem, the ""culture"" of the Japanese. Nobody in Japan cares about drifting, except for those fisherman of course, and not every teenage girl is a skank in a short skirt looking for ""awesome"" drifters. The plot was ridiculous, completely predictable. Hmm, love story with an outsider, dad gets involved with drifting, and o yeah someone dies. When Lucas Black's Japanese friend crashes his car, why did the car blow up? Was he carrying C-4 with him? The drifting scenes looked like they came right out of Need For Speed Underground, but without the point total on top. If you see this movie, at least get someone else to pay for you or just do not go at all. For the people that liked/loved this movie, they need to watch what a real movie is such as Fight Club, Reservoir Dogs, V for Vendetta, or Pulp Fiction.",Lgmsbroncs07,2006-06-20,2006,0.067,0.821,0.111,0.854,Positive
10.0,Best Fast and Furious movie,This movie trumps over the other 2 no problem. There is more excitement and more racing. More action packed and none of the sexuality or strong language content which is really great if you have a young one watching it with you. The cars are great I'm not really into cars but this movie I think changed that. I went and seen it last weekend at the Drive In and I am going to go see it again this weekend. That is how great it is. Lucas Black is awesome in it. He really has grown up since The War and Sling Blade. HHHHHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!! I give it 20 thumbs up. I promise you will not be disappointed. Well I guess that is all I can really say about you will just have to go watch it for yourself and decide what you think about it.,dachshundsr1,2006-06-20,2006,0.044,0.781,0.175,0.97,Positive

3.0,Is Vin Diesel the best part of this flick?,"No ... but his appearance is more disconcerting than seeing Donald Rumsfeld on Jon Stewart. It's a blatant teaser for the next F+F-Formula production, and his career side bet in case ‘Hannibal 2006’ doesn't pay off at the box office. The movie: absolute formula. ‘Characters dumb as a bag of rocks.’ Awful acting, ropey plot to kill time while waiting for the next hot cars and/or race-queen sequence. You might have 5 minutes of actual ‘drift racing’, but it's edited in that hyperkinetic MTV style so you won't really see anything... much less learn how to pay for $600+ sets of tires which last for mere minutes of use. The car action and incidental women are fine, but that shouldn't be enough for your movie ticket. You don't realize quite how far you've fallen until the sudden appearance of Diesel tells you it's time to leave the theatre air-conditioning; the movie's over and the ride was on *YOU*.",jginnane,2006-06-21,2006,0.143,0.837,0.021,-0.9706,Negative
5.0,"An average addition to the ""Fast and the furious"" franchise.","Not being a particularly ardent car-lover or fan of street racing at all, I didn't go into this movie with high hopes. Nevertheless, even for non-revheads like me there are enough enjoyable elements in this film to keep you from walking out. Some exhilarating car races, notable moments of humour and of course a veritable parade of attractive and underdressed women kept me entertained. The illogical storyline and numerous plot holes began to get annoying by the end; if the movie wasn't so long then this wouldn't have been as noticeable. Also, the Vin Diesel cameo was rather poorly played. Besides these admittedly minor gripes, there is a lot of fun to be had here - flashy cars, hot girls and a surprisingly competent Lil' Bow Wow in an amusing side-role.",reti_incarnate,2006-06-21,2006,0.017,0.721,0.262,0.9884,Positive
3.0,This movie was awful,"How do the movie makers convince the money men to send them to a place like Tokoyo and totally destroy a tried and true action series like F&F with big $$.

Pluease, The damsel in distress has the sex appeal of a small rock ( and I love pretty girls in school uniforms) and we are supposed to believe that she would ever deal with a local thug(s) who make their money how exactly (everyone is drinking soda). This should have been a R rating with tremendously sexy Japanese Girls and ADULTS making all the bad decisions. What did we learn? That it is OK to destroy hundreds of thousands of newly constructed homes in the USA, thousands of dollars worth of cars, with absolutely NO ramifications?. Oh yeah, and that you have to do fish tails around young Japaneses girls in their own hot cars to Just get their phone Number. TOO shallow, Too Unbelievable, and TOO typical a climax to the Movie.

8.0,Surprised,"I wandered into the theater to see Tokyo Drift as a time killer. Being a lover of all things Asian, I wasn't expecting much, but to my surprise, I really enjoyed the film. I had seen the original Fast and the Furious and found it passable entertainment and really didn't expect much from a second sequel, but this film really has heart, perhaps due to the many female production people listed in the credits.Lucas Black is Sean Boswell,a teen-aged racing fanatic who finds himself banished to the care of his father in Tokyo, Japan when his luck runs out with the law at home. Trying to fit into an alien culture, Sean finds himself falling into the illegal racing culture. A bad race lands him in servitude to a top racer who becomes a mentor. With a new girlfriend things are going well for Sean except that Han, his mentor is partners with a low level Yakuza underling who holds sway over his girlfriend Neela. Betrayal leads to murder and revenge culminating in a final nighttime race down a mountainside.While not a great script, the story held my attention throughout. Indeed, some of the Japanese school scenes suggest interesting possibilities for an entirely separate film. This is not a film about acting, but Lucas Black holds his own against the lovingly photographed cars. The other local performers all did well and as usual the Asian with blond hair is always a bad guy and why couldn't a Japanese actress be found to play the love interest?",Mark-129,2006-06-21,2006,0.14,0.674,0.185,0.9226,Positive
8.0,Stylish and exciting,"I was pleasantly surprised when i saw ""fast and the furious"" today. After a lackluster effort in the second movie, a new energy was injected into the series with ""Tokyo Drift"" I found that in ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" the people involved in creating the movie were scared of smashing up the cars too much. In races people would not bump into other cars, but would rather sit behind them trying to be menacing. The action also seemed to occur off the racecourse, instead of on, which is more characteristic of car movies.But enough of ""2 Fast 2 Furious"". On to ""Tokyo Drift"". This movie has just nothing to the previous movies in the series apart from racing and a cameo at the end of the movie. Many people will know that no characters from the last movie have been carried over into ""Tokyo Drift"". Instead of having a cop, the new main character is from the other side of the tracks and very early in the film it is established that he has a history of reckless driving.Don't expect too much from the storyline, it's very linear. There aren't any real big shocks. But this simplicity isn't important. What hooks you in is the style it is done with. The races are all exciting, even when you know who will win - as is the case with a race early in the film. Of course, as this film is all about drifting, there is an added danger. Car damage is dealt out constantly. There isn't many car scenes where all the cars come out clean. This is where ""Tokyo Drift"" excels - dirty and uncompromising racing. Whenever there is the chance cars clash, either to spin out the opponent, or knock them into a wall or even off a cliff.I recommend that people take a couple hours out of their day to sit back, relax and enjoy ""Tokyo Drift""",this_is_gibbo,2006-06-21,2006,0.097,0.8,0.103,0.3098,Positive
6.0,It's about time..,"When I first watched The Fast and The Furious in 2001. I thought a sequel to it would surely screw up. Sure enough, 2F2F came out, and I was right. I first thought, a third movie would completely ruin the franchise..Oh how wrong I am. This movie is jam packed with action from start to finish, and has little comedic moments thrown in. I was on the edge of my seat, and was shaking. At the last race, and at the end, my heart was beating like crazy. Tokyo Drift is the only TFTF movie that actually captured the import scene correctly. The first two were too Hollywood. This one has a new face, Sean Boswell(Played by Lucas Black), and he doesn't disappoint. When hes caught for destroying property, and street racing, he is sent to Tokyo, Japan to live with his father, who was in the military. He meets Twinkie(Played by Bow Wow) who links him into the world of underground racing, where a new form of racing called drifting (think of it as, turning..with style). Overall. I give The Fast and The Furious:Tokyo Drift a total of 10 out of 10. It made my heart beat, pulled me to the edge of my seat, and never bored me.

7.0,High-octane direction makes it entertaining,"Shawn is a young delinquent with a habit of getting in trouble due to his driving habits. His latest offense has him going to Tokyo to avoid jail time. It isn't long before he meets up with the car culture there and gets an embarrassing taste of drift racing by losing to a local champ who also has connections with the Yakuza. Soon Shawn is drawn into the underground world and a predictable, but stylish summer-fare ensues.The story here is one you've either seen before or will comfortably predict. Also, when going to see a second sequel to a franchise that is all about cars, what can you really expect? Nothing too spectacular on either story or action side of the film, but this is a surprising strong entry to a series, seeing that it is number 3 of course.The acting is decent with the clichés not being to overplayed or outrunning themselves, but rather just acting as connective tissue for the film's main event - the breakneck racing scenes. Which is exactly what the first film didn't quite reach and what the horrible second film in this franchise seriously lacked. The racing scenes here are possibly the best in the F&F franchise with a high octane direction that makes them very exciting to watch. They incorporate a lot of interesting shots - both CGI and real-life - mix it in with slow motion and all sorts of pans, which is then topped of with some frenetic editing and a hard rockin' soundtrack. That makes for some good fast- paced summer fun. 7/10Rated PG-13: violence, frenetic action, and some profanity",BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,2006-06-21,2006,0.077,0.805,0.118,0.9562,Positive

6.0,Movie Review & Cultural Commentary,"So, I went to see The Fast & the Furious: Tokyo Drift on Monday night with my girl friends, partially cause I really wanted to see it and partially because it was a great escape from the sweltering heat. I'm not a huge fan of pimped out cars, but I am a fan of Justin Lin (Better Luck Tomorrow is AMAZING, and everyone should see it) and hot leading men. Although the movie isn't Casablanca or anything the Oscars committee needs to keep its eye on, for what it is, Justin Lin does a great job with the silly plot and worn-down franchise. The cinematography of the movie is something to be reckoned with. Lin takes advantage of his Tokyo location and incorporates it quite nicely into the film. During one of the race scenes, Lin purposefully takes the chase to a stand still as the car takes a sharp corner, and while the contrast between the bright, flickering Tokyo lights against the paused car creates an aesthetically pleasing and memorable image, it also reminds the audience of the stark differences between street racing in Japan versus in the United States. As depicted early on in the film, street racing in the States merely attests to the speed and power of a car, and in a land where Roosevelt reminded us to talk softly and carry a big stick, how is it surprising that Americans constantly feel the need to prove the existence of its balls, from the government's decision to invade Iraq all the way down to the debased form of street racing? However, Japanese culture feverishly pulses with both life, beauty, and, most importantly, control. It thrives on diversity, and its contradictions only enrichen it. Japan is a country where the mountains still resonate with the lives of vegetable farmers and long-gone Samurais, but, at the same time, it is also a country where the yen takes off at rocket speed and sets the ever-soaring standard in technology and fashion (Harajuku, yes?). Therefore, it's not surprisingly that even something as uncharacteristically uncouth as street racing also embodies the unusual amalgam of speed and control in the form of drifting- and Lin is very well aware of this. His mix of testosterone-heavy chase sequences intermingled with its decelerated moments celebrates both Lin's love for the fast pace Tokyo lifestyle and the country's eastern spiritual roots. Moreover, Lin's beautiful, soft camera work depicts the care and subtleness that drifting embraces as opposed to American racing where it's all gas and all adrenaline without the gentleness. And for a director to convey this cultural gap, in a moment in the midst of raw action no less, is a stroke of talent. And while the main lead oozes Southern charm with his crooked smile and drawl, the Asian male leads hold their own in comparison, especially Sung Kang, who also starred in Lin's shattering Better Luck Tomorrow debut. Among all the Asians in the film, Kang is the only one (that I know of at least) that speaks English fluently and as a first language. In casting Kang, Lin introduces a character that many Asian Americans can relate to, unlike the sushi chefs and calculus nerds that Asians most frequently portray. Kang plays the character Han, a mobster that sympathizes with army brat, Sean Boswell, as he tries to break into the homogeneous Japanese underground street-racing world. Han is foremost an American, and only then does he identify with his Asian heritage. Because of his own American status, Kang's character is able to understand and befriend Boswell, but, simultaneously, his Asian features open a door into the exclusive Japanese culture. Furthermore, while Asian characters in the media tend to be the villain or the wimp, Han is neither. Yes, Han engages in illegal activity, like the typical, one-dimensional bad guy, but his character endears the audience with his low-key dialogue and half-smile. At moments, Han appears almost reluctant to embed himself in further shady dealings, as when he explains to Boswell that he has enough money and not enough loyal friends, but at other moments, he soaks in the lifestyle of Cristal and fast cars. Kang's convincingly complex Han is enough that even if one isn't a competitive street racer and mafioso (as many are not, I hope), a casual movie go-er will relate to the character's duality, whether Asian or not. Or maybe I'm just reading too far into a boy movie.",nagolberry,2006-06-22,2006,0.058,0.801,0.141,0.9975,Positive

9.0,Lived up to the purpose of its inception and then some.,"In a 2-day time span, I saw this movie and The Break-up, and I'm glad this one the vote for the one we saw first, even though I voted against it. I had lost faith in the series after 2 fast 2 furious, and was surprised that this one didn't take on the moniker 3 3rast 3 3rurious. The change of protagonist was a nice change, though the acting for his part could have been done better, and while the accent didn't get to me much, I found it rather amusing that most of the Asian actors had better enunciation than this one of the handful of Americans in the film. I went into this film expecting action, and action I received. From the first thrilling race against Zachery Ty Bryan in his daddy's Viper, to the final showdown against the very hate-able antagonist, and everything in between. I, like others, saw the first race, and thought ‘Okay, they can't POSSIBLY get any better than that!’ and was proved wrong as the protagonist comically smashed up a lent car. Speaking of smashed up cars, this had to be some of the best driving stunt work I've seen in a great long while. While a lot of the work was obviously CG, it was integrated so well that I barely noticed, and I'm working towards a B.A in Animation, so I have a better trained eye than most in noticing that sort of thing. My only major gripe was the midnight drift with the girl. It was extraneous, and, in my opinion, could have been cut. There are better ways for character development. I got something I didn't expect out of this movie as well. This elusive thing to most action flicks that we like to call ‘Plot’. While some of it was strained, I think that, considering the genre, they managed to put together a great plot. The idea was that the protagonist was an outcast automotive engineering student, who never fit in, except for racing. In his new So.Cal. Public School, complete with metal detectors, he gets into a squabble with the local football star, Zachary Ty Bryan over what all teenage boys fight over, a girl. Predictably, a race is chosen to decide this. After much destruction of property, he wins the race, but loses as his car flips, in what I think is one of the best uses of slow-mo since The Matrix. Afterwards, at the police precinct, he is in big trouble, and his mother bails him out in *ahem* unknown ways. His mother, presumably tired of moving every time her son gets into trouble (it's never said, but I believe it's a reasonable assumption), he is sent to Tokyo to live with his estranged Navy father. It is there that he gets involved in the underground world of Drifting, and proceeds to wreck up cars and get babes, and everything else. He manages to get into another fight about another girl, but this time with a guy who's Yakuza (Japanese mob for those less educated or who haven't seen this movie), or at least has Yakuza ties, and thus is more dangerous to mess with. This guy, known only as DK, becomes the source for much strife (obviously, as he's the main antagonist), eventually leading to the final race, involving my favorite car ever. I'm trying my best to leave out big spoilers here, so I won't give away the very end of it. All in all, this movie was an excellent film to see with friends. The adrenaline rush was so great through the movie, and the cars, as a side note, weren't the outrageous things from the first two. No neon under glow, and spoilers half the size of the car (maybe these tuner kids will stop blocking my view with them now), and the cars with spoilers actually needed spoilers (Honda Civics with spoilers always make me laugh). One thing to remember, though, is that it is an action movie, after all is said and done. It wasn't really created to portray a message, or do anything other than entertain. If you look too deep at this movie, you will be invariably disappointed. There's not much beyond face value to the movie, but it will be enjoyable if you take it as such.",terulian_maveric,2006-06-22,2006,0.082,0.807,0.111,0.9736,Positive

4.0,movie in two words- Tokyo and drift,"This movie was brutally average, and it seemed that the film makers wanted to accomplish two things. First was to make a movie in Japan. The other was to make a movie with expensive cars doing maneuvers not filmed before. The result of which was a movie mad with excellent visuals and fast paced action and the story was badly hurt by it. So much emphasis on making a cool looking movie that every one seemed to forget about the story. And there was good potential for a phenomenal story but any where they could have made the story shine they failed. Characters that were important to the main character were left under developed. You cant blame the screenwriter, but I haven't seen the script so maybe you can. And important plot points were nulled over and passed off just to get to the racing. But all in all the movie wasn't terrible or a complete loss, everything that made the movie bad can easily be corrected with another sequel. Which I am sure that Hollywood wouldn't have a problem with, it means more money for them.",garysbass,2006-06-22,2006,0.103,0.772,0.124,0.3863,Positive

It has a deeper plot than the first two and dives deeper into the characters to let you know (or guess) what is happening or what is going to happen and on top of that it even gives you ""quoteable quotes"" to remember the movie by. I enjoyed the way the movie was shot referring to the showing of scenes and then aciton and then scenes but i don't want to give anything away.

Tight rides and tighter tracks, Very few sequels stand up to the original, but this one was probably the best of the trilogy. There was less focus on the appearance of the vehicles than the first two, more on the story, and better racing. The guest star at the very end is a nice touch too, for those who have liked the whole series.

3.0,Slightly Entertaining Movie with bad actors and worst story,"This movie starts as expected and pretty entertaining, involving some street racing, and some 17yo who obviously doesn't fit in 'Sport America' and the whole high-school thing. I gotta say, from the first time I saw the main actor, and he going through the metal detectors, I tried to imagine he was going to an airport, then a university, even with cheerleaders, football teams and all the cliché that comes with movies presenting high schools, I thought that, because they casted a 23yo guy that looks like a 32yo, I'm still actually having trouble believing that the actor is only 23 years old. Sean 17 years old, played by Lucas Black, age 23, but looks 32, is the average American, with a slightly heavy, bad and annoying southern accent with a cowboy style goes to Tokyo after a race ends badly, there he meets with another bunch of 17yo who also look like in their late 20's, early 30's, and all have money, cars and lots of girls, including the main one, Neela, played by Nathalie Kelley, who obviously, gets disputed by both Sean, and his comic-book 'arch-villain' D.K.. The problem with the cast was with the choice for Sean and Neela, the first for being a bad actor and all of the reasons listed above, the latter because I think they injected her with so much botox, that except her mouth moving and eyes blinking and shedding some fake tears, you don't see any kind of facial expression whatsoever, the rest of the cast was good, even the Japanese playing the badly made character, D.K.. The story gets ridiculous from the minute Sean arrives in Tokyo, after school, he meets his demographically chosen friend and goes see the 'underground world of car racing', there he sees Neela again and from the start gets entangled in a love triangle involving the yakuza bad boy D.K., so, Sean challenges him for a race, oh wait, he doesn't have a car, no problem, some guy who never saw Sean before, or even knows his name, lends his 100k car, well, Sean trashes the car during the race, and that way, hey he made a new powerful friend, Han the Zen, all he did was trash his car. Anyway, some scenes of Sean learning how to drift happen, over and over and over and over and over again, some flirting with Neela, anyway, he end up winning a race from one of D.K.'s drivers, after that some news happen, Han is stealing from D.K., so some fighting ensues, Hans gets f-cked and then Sean decides to go talk with the Yakuza master of the region, D.K.'s uncle, he gives the uncle some money and propose some peaceful solution, a race between D.K. and Sean, nevermind that the fight was already over, Hans was dead and Sean had nothing to offer, or was any kind of threat to anyone, but hey, this is a sequel, so, 3 Fast and 3 Furious, some racing ensues with a predictable ending. One thing that was very enjoyable in this movie, was the street racing, those scenes were made in such a professional way, that one can only wish that the rest of the crew had the same competence, also those scenes remembered me a lot of Need for Speed, specially in the initial sequence, when some shortcut is taken, doesn't really try to distant itself when it puts some of the same soundtrack, which is also the only other positive point of the movie, of course, the producers had to ruin that also, the final street racing is by far the poorest, with all the curves looking the same, in the mountains, and some cellphones videos for some street racing fans. Any, this was a very bad movie, with a terrible story and even worst main cast, but with some decent supporting cast, good soundtrack and excellent street racing scenes, but I still don't recommend.",kok_warlock,2006-06-23,2006,0.128,0.765,0.107,-0.9756,Negative
8.0,Great entertainment! A great step up for the series.,"This movie RULES.I honestly don't understand the people who hated it. Yes, there is a good deal of very poor acting. Yes, the story is pretty stupid. Yes, everything about this movie is contrived... but honestly, are any of these surprising? Did we not expect this? The fact is, this movie stands head and shoulders above 2 Fast, 2 Furious. I do not believe that is an opinion. The acting is better, the story is better, the characters are more believable, the production value is FAR better... none of these are stellar by any means, but what you end up with is solid entertainment. As long as you know what you're looking at, you will laugh, whether they meant you to or not.I'm not sure if I enjoyed it more than the first F&F, but it's definitely a fun movie. Don't go looking for something believable, and don't expect a deep, involving story -- just go to be entertained, and I can almost guarantee you'll at least get a good laugh.There are definitely negatives, though. The acting is not good. Not awful, but not good. The female lead looks like Michael Jackson. I mean dog ugly. The plot is very simple, and not exactly involving.The positives, obviously, are the details. The races are certainly fun to watch; a LOT of the really stupid things (like, well, all the dialogue) can be really entertaining as long as you're not taking them seriously. There's a lot of idiocy that car people will catch and laugh at -- my knowledge of auto mechanics is mediocre, but I still got some great laughs out of this film. E-brake drifting in RWD cars... if you get it, you'll enjoy it.Overall... watch this movie to be entertained. I'm not disappointed; I'm glad I saw it on the big screen, and once it's out on DVD, I will definitely be obtaining a copy.7.5/10",etzool,2006-06-23,2006,0.093,0.625,0.282,0.9977,Positive

I mean yea the acting wasn't that great but the scenes in this movie were among the best I've ever seen, not to mention very suspenseful. The only thing that i wondered was, putting a southern alabama boy as the main character..weird. The first one was great it had a great plot and story line, the second funny and good, and this one was pretty good as well.Hopefully when they make a 4th one they wont go down.

3.0,Horrible plot and dialogue,"I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this movie had a rating 3.9, but I saw it last night and I say it was well deserved. It quite possibly has the dumbest plot I've ever seen, I think a grade 6 could have come up with a better plot. The plot is so basic, the main character experiences a whole new concept to racing, he sucks at it and then finds a mentor who *gasps* is not as good as the antagonist, but still pretty good, and then teaches him the ways of Drifting and then of course, the mentor can only guide the hero, but not actually be there whether because he dies/is wounded BECAUSE of the antagonist. Then the hero goes to avenge his mentor and wins where his mentor could not. Holy crap I was suspended the whole time. Also another thing that gripes me was the stupidest reasons they come up to race. ‘How should we settle this because I wanna lay the smack down on yo ass for talking trash/dishonoring me/talking to my gf/LIKING THIS MOVIE’ ‘Let's race’ This kinda crap gets regurgitated 3-4x throughout the movie 'nuff said. And another thing, it's hard to take the movie seriously when the main Protagonist sounds like the biggest douche ever, if there was ever a ‘Douche of the Year Award’, Lucas Black definitely deserves it. He sounds like Forrest Gump, except that was a decent movie. Seriously, the whole time I was expecting him to say ‘Life is like a box of chocolate, you never know what you're gonna get’ As a final note, unless you are wondering how to screw up a movie so badly where the movie involve cars, hot girls, and Yakuzas with a production budget of millions of dollars then watch this movie, otherwise I think you are better off doing whatever the hell you were doing before reading this review.",MaxX089,2006-06-23,2006,0.144,0.731,0.124,-0.7894,Negative
10.0,Good Movie,"I think this movie is far more superior than the first two. The cars are excellent and the special effects raise up your heart beats at times. The setting Tokyo is very interesting, it's quite different from the first two. At first I thought this was going to be a lame movie but it really surprised me, it was more than what I expected. The actors are great, you will never get bored. The plot is intense, there are sad and good moments. I love the movie soundtrack and I love the ending. The ending was the best part. I think this is a must see movie, trust me it wont hurt seeing it. I can't wait to see part 4, I hope it takes place in Tokyo as well.",blue_skyrose,2006-06-23,2006,0.034,0.63,0.336,0.9949,Positive

10.0,' loved it its was extremely beautiful',"i have loved everyone of the fast and furious films as i love cars and have always wanted to become a female racer. the film was very predictable but all films are. I'm very emotional so me and me female friends cried in the middle though none of the boys did. i loved the romance and the cars and the glamour and gracefulness of drifting. I think all the actors were great even my friends that didn't like cars enjoyed the film. loved it all!!! i feel that i got my moneys worth and that i would recommend this film to anyone, most of all under 30's and not just boys. Its a film i could watch again as it contains my passion for hot cars and partying.",shuger1,2006-06-24,2006,0.067,0.609,0.325,0.994,Positive
10.0,The Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift is superb,"I'm a great fan of the original Fast and Furious and was extremely excited when 2 Fast 2 Furious was released only to be extremely disappointed. I wasn't to keen on seeing the Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift but i'm really glad i did. This film is superb, its actioned pack and has a genuine believable story line to it that gets you sitting on the edge of your seats. The huge plus to this film was Vin Dieseal even though it was only for a short amount of time. The new cast has brought a fresh and exciting presence to the film. Bring on the 4th Fast and Furious and hopefully we'll see Vin Dieseal in it, as well as all the new cast.

10.0,Stunts,"I loved the movie so much!!!!!! The stunts in it are amazing and so beautiful. Unfortunately however, the person in charge of this movie actually knows nothing about cars and hardly any of it was actually filmed in Japan (most of it was actually done in California). Nonetheless, I really liked it, simply because the driving stunts were amazing and I'm a big fan of drifting. The cars are all a little too flashy for me, but it's to be expected when the name 'Fast and the Furious' is attached to the title, but still I really like what they did with it. People think that since it's a Fast and the Furious movie that it will such for some reason, or that it's childish. Personally, I think that's stupid on their part. Sure, the character development and the plots a little screwy at times, but in all honesty.... who really goes to see that anyway? It was even said in an article that most people go to see if for the cars and the magazine even admitted to the fact that the writer didn't even remember the names of the people in the first two. I loved the movie, I thought it was amazing and the drivers were all so talented.",Tsubasa_Lillies,2006-06-24,2006,0.085,0.746,0.169,0.9668,Positive
6.0,indulgent popcorn fluff,"Rev head Sean has been in trouble with the law for awhile. Hitting his third strike when racing through a construction site, he's shipped over to Japan to live with his father. Instantly on the wrong side of everything, it's not long before he's back into the racing world, introduced to a different style of racing; drifting, using the tightly constructed car parks for races. To full of himself, Sean takes on DK; Drift King, using DK's business partner Han's car. Losing the race and smashing Han's car, Sean becomes in debt to him to pay for the car.The whole of the Fast and the Furious franchise is all about the spectacle. Glossy, fast paced action, great cars, hot women, an abundance of over indulgence. The spectacle is what made the franchise so interesting and so popular. Slapping together a story line to serve the action and badly written dialog are easily over looked, only to the extent that you deliver some amazing action sequences. Director Justin Lin has on account delivered some amazing action scenes. The energy and adrenaline run hard and fast, with tyres screeching at ear piercing levels. This does run off set pieces; the chase through Tokoy city is one great example, leaving you just waiting for the next piece to arrive, though the down side is you have to sit through terrible acting and plot ridden story.When your characters are so broadly drawn and one dimensional, you don't give your actor much to go on; yet they aren't that talented in the first place. Verging on Grease levels of older actors playing teenagers, Lucas Black doesn't have much strength to carry this as the lead Sean, walking around with a stunned mullet. Sonny Chiba comes off cartoonish as a Yakuza boss. Brian Tee lacks menace as DK. Sung Kang does the best performance as Han, not taking his role to any real serious level.If you start to think about all its inconsistencies or take this serious for even a second, it hurts your mind. It's a piece of entertaining popcorn fluff.",nobbytatoes,2006-06-24,2006,0.103,0.806,0.091,0.2451,Positive
7.0,"Very Cool ""Drift""","""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" stars Lucas Black and Bow Wow (grown up Lil' Bow Wow). There are no stars in ""Tokyo Drift"". Then again, the true stars are the ""rice burner"" cars racing through the streets and parking garages in Japan. None of the characters from the last ""The Fast and the Furious"" sequel made the trip to Tokyo. So for Director Justin Lin, he has a formulaic story by Chris Morgan populated with attractive heroes and villains, fast cars, and hot women in a very polished package. Here Lin and Morgan use the exotic locale to highlight the underground extreme sports culture of drifting in Japan. Lin and Morgan also provide insight into modern Japanese culture itselfunexpected and provocative. In a stylish signature scene Japanese young people at night stand along the winding downhill road of the climactic race, send and receive video camera images from each other via their cell phones. Brilliant. Director Lin effectively tells his story through captivating imagery.Shawn Boswell (Lucas Black) is a 17 year-old constantly in trouble for racing muscle cars at school. As the movie opens, his latest run in with the law could land him in jail as an adult. Instead his mother negotiates to have Shawn live with his father in Tokyo. His Dad, Major Boswell (a good Brian Goodman) tells Shawn the house rule is ""No racing"". Shawn attends a rigid Japanese school with the mandatory uniform. It is all very high tech, wireless laptops in the classroom. Every kid has an iPod. Shawn hooks up hipster Twinkie (Bow Wow), who introduces him to the nocturnal world of drifting. Shawn would like to hook up with the beautiful Neela (Nathalie Kelly), but she is with DK (Drift King played by Brian Tee). Shawn loses a race in an inept display to DK. However, in the process Shawn gains a mentor and friend in Han (Sung Kang). Han is DK's business partner. DK's uncle Kamata (Sonny Chiba) is Yakuza. DK is someone not to mess with.From the totally ignorant and fascinated perspective, this is a simplistic take on 'drifting'. You have lightweight high torque cars capable of 130 mph with soft tires for turns. In drifting the driver accelerates the turn with the parking brake engaged. It's kind of like self imposed chaos. You are in control when you are totally out of control. Though DK is the Drift King, Han is the Zen master of drifting. Han confides in Shawn ""It's all about trust and character."" Sung Kang has a presence and ease as Han. Han tells Shawn during his training that he is going to have to figure it out for himself by doing, ""There is no 'wax on, wax off'."" Justin Lin captures the adrenaline rush of extreme speed, and the amazing impassion of the drivers. Lin also paints a fascinating picture of this drift culture metaphor. The Japanese kids during the day wear their pressed uniforms, and attend their classes without question. All is ordered and structured. At the drift races, the girls wear their pimped out Britney Spears clothes, and the guys have their spiked out hair and tatts on display. All shiny objects. Fast high tech cars. Hot girls. All rebellion. Here Lin is all style, and it works. There are no real surprises in terms of story in ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"". Relative newcomer Lucas Black is charismatic and believably pulls off Shawn. Nathalie Kelley is gorgeous and charming in the card board cut-out role of Neela. And remember to stick around till the end for a surprise from Lin. ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" will not win awardsit is just very hip and very cool.",jon.h.ochiai,2006-06-24,2006,0.068,0.811,0.121,0.9887,Positive
8.0,Fast and the Furious: Tokoyo Drift,"Fast, beautiful cars, sexy Asians, and fights....Does that interest you? Because that's what this movie is. Nothing else though since there is no plot.The plot is for some reason the main guy is moved to Tokoyo. In Tokoyo he meets a guy who shows him underground racing, there he is introduced to drifting. He tries racing and gets his ass handed to him. So for most of the movie he does pointless drifting and hitting on this guys girl. His uncle(that he lives with in Tokoyo) doesn't like him driving, but then he ends up letting him do the most dangerous race at the end.The acting alright. The emotion at times was bad, and the main character was absolutely dreadful. Yay, let's put a total hick with a huge accent as the main character and put him with a bunch of Chinese people who can only have two emotions. Mad and calm.The cars were beautiful, as were the girls that were bending over the cars. They choreography of the racing and stuff was very well done, and it looked quite real, so were the crashes.Overall the movie was pretty cool, but a bad plot, but I'd watch it again.",typhill,2006-06-24,2006,0.117,0.751,0.132,0.4065,Positive
6.0,Good racing sequences get lost in a movie with too much talk and similarities to other films.,"High school kid who gets caught racing one time to many is sent off to Tokyo to live with his father. There he finds himself mixed up in the Japanese underworld and racing once more in the ""drifting"" style.This movie has great car sequences, some good characters, some nice lines of dialog and by all rights it should have worked but the film frequently loses sight of whats going on its own world and so we're left to twiddle our thumbs. After a good set up to the story the action moves to Japan. Our hero's dad lays down the law he's to go to school and not race. After an initial run in about staying out late the film jettisons the notion that anyone is in school or that the kid has a curfew and concentrates on the characters and the romance. This would be fine, except that after 20 minutes of set up there really isn't any sort of racing for about 40 minutes (I know I checked my watch). From that point on the film shoots to its conclusion in a rapid and entertaining fashion. Unfortunately the the damage is done and you're not as fully engaged as you should be. Its not bad, hey I didn't walk out, but its not what it should have been.I have to say that the one thing that really bothered me about the movie is that the film is very similar to the Chinese film Initial D, especially in its climatic race. Actually it seemed like a mobbed up version of Initial D with violence added to the story of racing. Its not fatal, but if they wanted to remake that film why change so much of the story?Worth a look on video or cable. Not worth 10 bucks in theaters.",dbborroughs,2006-06-24,2006,0.072,0.834,0.094,0.7506,Positive
3.0,An abomination of all that is right in this world.,"This is my first movie review. Prior to this, I had no intention nor any reason that would provoke me to respond to a movie by writing a review. I feel that if you are going to spend ten or twenty minutes of your life in front of a computer in order to deliver a message about a movie to random strangers, the movie has either impressed you and you want to extol the sheer brilliance that you have just witnessed, or the movie was so bad that you want to JUST WARN PEOPLE TO STAY AWAY FROM IT! In the case of The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, this is a HUGE WARNING. If you have a moment, take some time to read ahead and explore the crapfest that is The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. Much, if not all, of this movie is crowded with higher tier actors (Vin Diesel at the end is the only exception... and to be honest... he's not even that great of an actor.. he's just good at his static, one dimensional character roles which require minimal talent). Lucas Black (you know..... that guy from Friday Night Lights...) hardly does any real acting. And of course, Bow Wow tops the list of amazing and talented actors that make up this movie (let's not forget other classic Bow Wow movies such as Johnson's Family Vacation...). Clearly, the script was written by a seventh grader. I see no possible way that a living and breathing human being can come up with so much horrible, gut-wrenching, cheesy, mindless dialogue. Some of the lines are also completely irrelevant to the ‘storyline’ of the movie. They make the characters try to sound deep, but instead they created the biggest over indulgent piece of crap ever known to man. Ten minutes into the movie, and you'll notice the problematic script. Yet the dialogue, sad to say, is not the least of its problems. The storyline. Man, wow............................................................ ............................................................... where do I begin? Sean Boswell is a seventeen year old student who loves to race cars. Challenging the rich kid, he completely destroys his car and is just a short step away from juvy. Instead, he gets sent to Tokyo to live with his father. So far, the plot makes sense. Here's where it goes wrong. Sean Boswell gets drawn to the racing world.... Then an hour of complete crap happens, he learns to drift, and he challenges the nephew of the local mob boss to a race, making it clear to his father that ‘he has to fix this’ ----> yea.... I'm just as lost as you are, the dialogue doesn't help either. Then he wins the race (surprise surprise) and instantly becomes the new King of the racing world. Oh and guess what, he also wins the girl! no movie would be complete unless the guy wins the girl. Anyways, there really is no set plot here. A guy looking to stay out of trouble suddenly becomes the hottest thing in underground racing. Not to mention, the mob boss is a pansy. There really is no bad guy in this movie. You'd figure it would take more than a race for some seventeen year old kid to prove himself to THE MOB. Granted this goes down as a partial mob movie, it is probably the most inaccurate and stupid mob movie of all time. Basically this movie comes down to good looking cars, fast paced action, and Asian cleavage. What the film lacks in consistency, dialogue, acting, and everything else that makes a movie great, it tries to make up for in tight Asian skirts and huge breasts. What gives this movie any hope for a great review is the fast paced racing scenes. If there is anything Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift has done right, it's the racing scenes. I must admit, they were pretty entertaining to watch. Yet that still does not make up for the poor acting, horrible script, and senseless/ridiculous plot that is The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. Had the filmmakers polished up some of these areas, this film might have a fighting chance for a good review. However, right now that is not the case. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a horrible abomination of everything that is right in this world. So far it has prompted a loser like me to sit here at one o'clock in the morning and issue this review/warning to avoid this movie at all costs.

1.0,What?!??!?!,"Whoever voted for this so highly needs to be educated. The plot was absolutely horrible. How is a race going to settle the conflict? How did a busy Tokyo street completely clear up because he honked his horn. How did he learn to be the best at drifting in a few days when he was no where near a good racer as is. The whole crowd was outraged and laughing at the idiocy of the writers at this part, among many others. There was no depth to any of the characters. We barely saw any nice cars, although the drifting was nice. The whole movie was not tied together at all. I don't want to spoil anything so I'll just leave it at this. Don't pay to see this movie.

7.0,For Once Take The Movie For What It Is!!!!!!!!!,"DAHMMMMM!!!!! For once would you people take a movie for what it is??? Why does every movie that does well on this site have to be a groundbreaking, heart touching, and life changing experience??? The one word to sum up this movie is ""great"". If you love great looking, suped up cars, hot women (especially hot Asian women) this movie is for you. The action in the movie was basically non-stop. There was always a race or chase or something happening to keep the movie flowing. It was never boring and you always were waiting to see what would happen next.Of course there is some cheesy dialogue and a tiny bit of weak acting here and there but its a great action movie and especially if your into cars.Even my girlfriend who I had to basically drag into the theater enjoyed it a lot.The icing on the cake was Vin Diesel's cameo at the end. It was great to see him back behind the wheel and I hope that maybe he would be interested in doing another fast and furious with him starring in it.Simply for what the movie is, its a great movie. I wish this would have been the sequel to the original because if it was I think the series would still be a strong and popular franchise.So all you people who are giving it bad reviews and low rating need to have there head examined.

8.0,Much better than the other 2,Where do i start with this film? When i first heard this film wasn't going to have any of the original cast in it i felt rather disappointed but my opinion has totally changed after seeing it for the first time.The cast in it are great.Lucas plays his part well as does bow wow and the guy who plays Han. The things that stood out for me were the racing scenes mainly.There are a lot more than there were in the other 2 films and in my own opinion the races in this third are a lot better than any in the first two. The story isn't half bad either.I actually prefer this one to the 2nd film because of that as well as the racing. This is definitely a must see for all fans of the other two films though.,bopper-5,2006-06-26,2006,0.013,0.812,0.176,0.9783,Positive
2.0,Go instead: Legend of Speed,"This was the least entertaining film I've seen recently. Don't get me wrong, I am a girl AND I enjoyed The Fast and The Furious, as it was a ‘piece of fun’. But this film is exhibit A when people speak of the ‘no plot, all action’ movies that come out of America these days. I had two main problems with this movie: 1) This film was set in Tokyo, yet the main character didn't speak Japanese, he was placed in a school where classes were taught in Japanese. Also, I have never seen so many American-speaking Japanese actors in one movie, this film pays no respect to the culture, showing viewers a false world that Japan is truly accessible to non-Japanese speakers (which is not the case), that the Japanese people are most willing to sideline their own language to benefit one ignorant American person. 2) The great holes in plot was what makes the viewer feel dislocated from the characters, events. It is a rule in film that you have a ‘build’ then a ‘climax’, (meaning that the tension within a story is built, holding the viewer's attention then at the ‘climax’, the viewer feels the desired emotion of the event eg. death, birth, shock) This film does not use this: the plot goes along steadily, then hits ‘climax’-like points without ‘build’ or even explanation! I sat there often thinking ‘who's that?’, ‘what just happened?’ Even with the death of the main character's friend, which was supposed to make the viewer feel sad at that moment, missed target because of no ‘build’. The events went as follows: car business is alerted to money being taken from accounts, car business owner threatens and tries to kill said friend, main character and others escape in a car, friend is getting away as well in another car, friend's car crashes and he burns to death. The death leaves viewers confused as to what they have just seen. We are told hurriedly about the company's accounts, which we really should have been alerted to before, this is truly poor scripting. Overall, I find this movie to be too loose in the story-telling, not enough research was done about the location. I wasn't even too fond of the ‘drifting’. The final race between the main character and his nemesis was too close to being reminiscent of the Speed Racer series, for my liking. If you want a movie in a similar vein, try ‘The Legend of Speed’. It did what the filmmakers were trying to achieve here.",angel_starfine,2006-06-26,2006,0.146,0.763,0.091,-0.9853,Negative
8.0,Much Better than I Expected,"I fought with my friends to not see this movie. I begged, pleaded, and stomped my feet. Then, I gave in and loved it. Compared to the other two, this movie is alone. I loved the driving. I loved the acting and the character interaction. I even loved the cars, thought I am definitely a muscle fan. My heart did sink a bit when the Nissan engine got put in the beautiful Ford Mustang. But that has nothing to do with this. I really felt something when one of the characters died, as did, I believe, everyone in the theater. The acting really is superb. The end was a touch cheesy and the last 15 seconds does tie the 3 movies together well, but I say, ‘Forget those others then you see this movie.’ Enjoy this beauty of a racing movie.",MysteryMovieMan,2006-06-26,2006,0.047,0.724,0.23,0.9843,Positive
10.0,Destined to be a Cult Classic,"Tokyo Drift is going to be one of those love it, hate it movies, much like 2001: A Space Odyssey and other cult classics. For those who are in to cars, this movie much like the first of the series brings a never-before-seen aspect of car driving to the silver screen. The drifting scenes are revolutionary and exciting; it may be remembered as the Bullit of the 21st century. It may do for drifting what the other previous two series did for tuning. That is bringing it out of the underground and making it more mainstream. Unlike other director who might of taken the short-cut and the easy way out of using CG to create the drift scenes. Director Justin Lin actually used real drivers and cars, which helps to bring a level of realism not found in other films. Justin Lin also accomplishes that he is so adapt at, that is portraying a part of Asian youth culture that the general public usually doesn't now see.The story itself is a trial and trued pattern of forbidden romance. Although the plot may lack originality, it is far from boring. But the focus of the film is on the cars and the driving and not on the plot. I think this is where the film gets into trouble with critics who lack the appreciation of the cars and the driving scenes. Many reviewers get lost in trying to find something from this film that is not meant to be there. If you want they want something mind opening, watch Brokeback Mountain. If you want to watch a movie for exciting and great action/driving scenes that you wouldn't be ashamed to talk to your friends about, watch this movie.",liubhs02,2006-06-26,2006,0.061,0.804,0.135,0.9686,Positive
10.0,Well ....kinda cool..,"Got my movie from a local area server(fortunately it was the good screen version one), shoved it in my usual player, got my popcorn, lay-ed back on my chair and pressed play... Well, the second Fast and Furoius had a cooler UNIVERSAL promo... At first i thought it was going to be a teenager kind of movie and got disappointed, but after a while, it started to catch me... What can i say...the special effects got me off the chair... made me press that rewind button:)) The movie has some awesome special effects and a nice story...even dough it is standard... they fight over a girl, but in overall it is cool.

10.0,F&F 3 Rocked,"Fast and the Furious:Toyko Drift was an excellent movie. The races were interesting and the movie kept my attention the whole time. Some of the scenes of the movie had me on the edge of my seat, unlike the other 2, where I could fall asleep and miss nothing. Bow Wow did an excellent job (he actually looked like he belonged in the high school). The scenery was cool, especially the parking garage.The only draw back was that Vin Diesel only made a cameo, and the main racer was supposed to be under 18 and he looked like he was in his 30's. Other than that it rocked. The cars kicked butt (so did the paint jobs). It's a good movie to go see if you are bored out of your mind and you want to see something that will get you blood flowing.",buffyangelspikeyscoobysb,2006-06-26,2006,0.042,0.824,0.134,0.9304,Positive
10.0,Tokyo Drift,"‘The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift’ is the third of the F&F movies; it delivers all the races and crashes you could possibly desire, and a little more. After only one day in school, Sean (Lucas Black) is offered a customized street speedster, and is racing down the ramps of a parking garage against the malevolent D.K. The racing strategy is called ‘drifting.’ It involves sliding sideways while braking and accelerating, and the races involve a lot of hairpin turns. The movie ends with a warning that professional stunt drivers were used, and we shouldn't try this ourselves. Like the stunt in ‘Jackass’ where the guy crawls on a rope over an alligator pit with a dead chicken hanging from his underwear, it is not the sort of thing likely to tempt me.",tipharris12,2006-06-27,2006,0.072,0.892,0.036,-0.7351,Negative
7.0,Tokyo Drift.....drifting away from the plot...,"First off, I quite liked this movie. For a movie that followed on the heels of 2Fast this is an achievement. 2Fast was just just lameness personified. Tokyo Drift, or 3Fast, as I will refer to it, was much more restrained. Sure, it had foolish plots, love story, fast, scalextric like cars and all, but it was less....stupid. At least, for 90% of the movie. There are two things that really stand out as a ‘spit-your-coke-into-the-hair-of-the-guy-sitting-in-front’ moments.’ Firstly, and right from the start, we are expected to believe that the lead character is 17 years old. This is the same trick that was pulled in Biker Boyz and it doesn't work here either. Granted, the age difference wasn't as great here, but the guy is actually 24, not 17, and looks nearer 30. Not good for suspension of disbelief. Secondly, towards the end, having peed-off the local crime boss, the ‘hero’ boldly goes into the lion's den to make amends and settle honour.......by suggesting a car race with the loser leaving town! I'm not sure if it was intentional or not, but Sonny Chiba really did look completely non-plussed at the suggestion. You knew it had to happen...it's a car racing movie, after all, but it was just ridiculous. A car race to the death, or the loser having finger's cut-off.....maybe. But not leaving town! Beyond lameness. There are bright spots, though. The racing is pretty entertaining, and they've done away with the ‘hyperspace’ graphics when someone presses the nitrous button. There are a few scenes where the ‘hero’, whilst learning to drift, thwacks a wall and the car doesn't show the damage in the next scene, but does at the end, but that is just down to bad editing. You'd think it'd be easy enough these days to CGI a few dents in for effect. Also good was Sung Kang, as Han (not as in Han Solo, though he has some of the same qualities) who is by far the most likable of all the characters in the film, with his life-zen outlook and easy manner. He steals most scenes he's in, without really even trying. And there is the obligatory cameo at the end from a certain former Fast and Furious star. Not sure whether this was to give the film some kind of ‘legitimacy’ in the franchise, or to hint at his involvement in the inevitable next movie. Either way, an interesting little scene right at the end. Overall then, better than the second movie by far, but still not up to the first one. But worth a watch, nonetheless.",Rob_Taylor,2006-06-27,2006,0.11,0.785,0.105,-0.7134,Negative
4.0,this movie sucks,"OK, not only does it not make sense, the story is just stupid and boring.I watched the whole thing without sleeping only because I kept waiting for some good car action ... but it never came.Oh, and they smash up almost every car. It almost made me cry tears of rage ... such a waste of nice cars (not that you really get to see what they are anyway).They should've just focused on the cars.... Instead they tried a story as well and blew the whole movie. Nothing in it was enjoyable.At first I saw Bow Wow was in the movie. So naturally I thought ... dam Bow Wow is a great rapper, so this should help the movie. Instead, his character is a criminal loser, with the most stupid ride I've ever seen.Then the opening scene with the usual college kids trying to be baddass and the *good strong kid* against them. Dam ... he was supposed to be a hero but instead he gets owned ... and this is the main character I'm talking about.So then I thought, wow, so maybe he gets off to a slow start and he starts showing some skills in Tokyo. Nope. He just goes from one stuff-up to the next. And someone always ends up giving him something else to stuff up and the movie goes on and on. The whole way through I'm in disbelief and trying to keep myself from falling asleep by thinking that he will finally show some skills and own up the bad guys.Then that moment comes and he wins ... but its such an anti-climax. Not sure why. I think its because I never really saw any good skills. Or maybe its cos there was no point to the win. Or maybe its because I never really got a sense of the racing. Or maybe its because their race 'tactics' involve smashing into the opponents car. Dunno.",joshuabeattie1,2006-06-27,2006,0.104,0.728,0.168,0.9847,Positive

3.0,Not the best of the lot,"Graphics were alright, but other than that it was pretty awful. Acting was pretty average, and the story line was a bit too cheesy. If I could, i would certainly go and get my money back, although I can't deny that the sound of the engines was nice to hear on the surround sound. The camera angles made the driving seem too easy, and just the whole idea of racing on the streets of Tokyo in the middle of so much traffic is just hard to swallow... Won't recommend that you go and waste the money in to watch in theaters, but it might be worth the watch on DVD if you have nothing better to do. I think i liked the second one the best out of the three F&F movies, but even that one wasn't worth paying, so you can probably guess how horrible the acting was.",Omarsolaija,2006-06-28,2006,0.115,0.698,0.186,0.9364,Positive

7.0,"Not bad, better than the last.","This film was definitely not as bad as the second. OK, they've all been fairly rubbish, but in a good ‘enjoy them with a few friends and a few beers’ kind of way! It was a good way to distract yourself for a few hours, and I could think of worse ways to spend £6. The plot was slightly better (although still fairly crap) than before, and the actors weren't too bad. The cars and race scenes were up to their usual standard and looked pretty slick - I think the reason this one's about drifting is so they could tie-in the fantastic number of gear changes used throughout the series. The addition of several hundred hot Asian woman wearing very little could only be described as the icing on top! The appearance of Vin Diesel made the film for me, it was uber-cheesy and had me in stitches.",ilikeyoghurt,2006-06-28,2006,0.057,0.743,0.2,0.9774,Positive
6.0,cars in the rising sun,"Mark Kermode always warns against seeing films which are based on computer games. Theyare all meant to be awful without any plotting instead relying on brand recognition and glossy producing and a couple of good looking women. Go back and watch Citizen Kane then. This is fun, rookie driver with dark past, we've heard it over and over again for 60 years ""I'm troubled, I let someone down"" so we know where we're starting from. He goes to Japan to take part in a lame macho, genital waving affair of motor racing. The usual dichotomy of good and bad guys who fit clear personality types with no ambiguity as usual. Then the cars do their thing and thats what you've been waiting for. I and some others ended up seeing this as a result of the actress Ashika Gogna and another who had been used as a part of a painting by the actor and scientist Stephen Armourae. Knowing her had an eye for a good thing (or what he likes) I gave this movie a go, it was a pleasant surprise that despite all its clichés it was entertaining and if cars are your thing you sure will be happy.

6.0,More of a comedy than an action movie,"The movie wasn't too bad, at least not as bad as some of the other movies that are still out. I didn't like Bow Wow's character too much. He seemed out of place in Tokyo and I'm not saying that just because he is not Asian. Twinkie, Bow Wow's character, seemed a little too...American for Japan. He had been living there longer than Sean, yet Sean some how managed to learn more Japanese than him. And Sean never did really get the girl. Sure, there were implications that they liked each other, but there's no romance in their relationship at all. My friends didn't really appreciate how Sean, a white man who had just moved to Japan, became the new DK or Drift King. And why was Vin Diesel in it exactly? What I did like about this movie is how funny it was. I'm sure the writers weren't aiming for funny, but my friends and I just found the entire movie hysterical. Like why was it that the whole entire school was into drifting? And there was this one scene where they were racing in a crowded street and everyone just somehow knew they were drifting and formed the shape necessary for the drift to occur.

9.0,Turns out I am a red blooded male!!,"I saw the very first Fast and The Furious a lot of years ago and I only remember I didn't like it at all. I'm just not a car guy, I don't known the difference between an engine block and a car stump and Nascar or any car racing usually bores me to tears. I never even bothered seeing the second installment of this series and I had no desire at all to see this third one despite my love for movies which eventually is what caused me to see it. I had nothing else to see and I really wanted to go to the movies so there I was sitting in the theater and all car movies are usually described as ‘High Octane’ but Fast and The Furious Tokyo Drift defines that!! How great is it when a film you have such low expectations of turns out to be incredible?? That's exactly what happened for me with this film. Not only are the car race and chase scenes edge of your seat, beautifully and brilliantly choreographed, but the story is really good!! The performances from the cast are also really good. It was an all around great movie that is definitely worthy of a night out. Lucas Black who has done some great work as of recently in Jarhead, and Cold Mountain plays country boy who loves his cars Sean Boswell. Black plays Boswell like the absolutely perfect hero. He's rough, tough, don't mess with him, but at the same time, loyal, handsome, even suave in a country kind of way. And on top of that he's completely out of his element by dropping into the high speed world of Tokyo street racing and Tokyo in general. Such a huge part of the greatness of this film is seeing this boy completely out of his element determined to win back the thing he knows best...racing. He's never quite the underdog but you absolutely root for him. Black does a really great job and I think this film could really be a stepping stone for him to leading man status. Newcomer Nathalie Kelley plays Black's love interest, and racing fanatic herself Neela. Now for an actress, especially a newcomer to hold her own in an absolutely testosterone driven film is pretty impressive and she does exactly that. I still wouldn't say her performance is fem-powered, I mean the girls are still somewhat trivialized as ‘car-babes’ but for the only leading female role she does very well. Her and Black's character have good strong chemistry and she drives with the best of them when you finally see her behind the wheel. I am positive you haven't seen the last of Nathalie Kelley. Bow Wow (formerly Lil) plays hustler Twinkie (Twink.) I have to say that Bow Wow is not one of the stronger performances in the film. He does alright but he is definitely overshadowed but strong performances by Black in the lead role and the other characters around him. His character I think is a lot weaker than the others and it makes it hard to be a decent role. Mostly a TV actor Brian Tee plays bad guy/tough guy D.K. (Drift King.) He is absolutely excellent as the bad guy, even though he does come across as something of a schmuck, I think that's the idea. He is the perfect contrast and adversary to Black's Sean Boswell. D.K. is everything that Boswell isn't and has his girl, his talent, and his cars. I would like to see Tee in a hardcore bad guy role in the future, he was excellent and you hated him but knew it was going to be fun to watch him get his in the end. Sung Kang is terrific as D.K.'s business partner but also adversary secretly. Kang plays Han who immediately takes to Sean Boswell and brings him aboard convinced he is a trustworthy person to have on his side which definitely turns out to be true. Kang's performance is subtle, quiet, but really good. He is a mentor and kind of an anti-hero in many ways. Great performance!! Director Justin Lin captures the Asian street world in such a way that it just draws you in. Scenes of Tokyo alone are stunning and seeing Lucas Black's character dealing with not only the street world but school and every day life in a completely foreign atmosphere gives this film so much more than just car racing. It has such depth and really an interesting and powerful movie. I don't know if it's action or drama but somewhere in the middle is something that for a third installment to a series about car racing is so impressive!! And even myself NOT being a fan of the series the twist surprise cameo at the end was awesome and brought a smile to my face since there was no real connection to the other films until that moment. Beginning to end it locked me in and left me on the edge of my seat with amazing performances, terrific scenery and direction and great characters. Absolutely worthy of seeing!!

Lucas Black delivers a spectacular performance of young teen who finds his calling under the tutelage of Han, a man of authority in the Tokyo underground. This film does live up to the standard set by the first Fast and the Furious. from an amateur vs. expert drifting race to a drifting chase through the streets of Tokyo, to a final climactic race down a mountain, the scenes are full of believable action.

7.0,Moving it to Japan made it worthwhile for me,"OK I'll concede it wasn't quite as good as the first two, but I still enjoyed this film. I felt that moving the location to Japan and introducing a new style of racing made a decent job of making the movie fresh.If it had just been another American coastal city (LA or Miami) with a bunch of regular drag races with some of the same people as the other two, it would have been a boring movie. But by having cute little Japanese girls wearing the skimpy outfits this time around, and featuring the beautiful backdrop of Tokyo (for some of the scenes anyway), and by using a fresh and totally new cast, I felt it made the movie worth one viewing.Plus I liked the cars as much or better than the cars of the first two films. The 460 HP twin turbo Nissan 350Z was an awesome machine for DK to drive in the film. I really loved the modified RX-7 with Han. Even the RX-8 was nice to look at, almost as nice to look at as the driver Neela. A lot of people made a beef about putting a Skyline engine in the old '67 Mustang, but at the same time, every single car in the film and in the street/drift racing scene has 95% of the original body/engine parts removed and/or replaced anyway, so what's the big deal with giving it a different engine? This isn't' the greatest movie ever made. But if you just want a nice 95 minute cheap thrill ride while looking at cute girls cheering on the guys driving their $60,000 turbocharged rides, it's solid entertainment.",ccaudle,2006-07-02,2006,0.035,0.741,0.225,0.9966,Positive
6.0,Could do with some polishing.,"I'll say the first thing that came to mind when I was going to offer my comments/reviews on this film: The first two were obviously better. Mainly because the story lines were thought about carefully. FF3 was to me, absolute rubbish in certain parts of the film. But I think I thoroughly enjoyed most of the action with the cars and because I love Japan, it was nice to see great views of it from every aspect. (From city night life to the school life) As much as I also enjoyed see a certain someone at the very end, it actually made the ending quite pathetic. I saw no logic behind it.But nonetheless, I enjoyed this film but I'm still deciding as to whether or not I should purchase the DVD.

6.0,"2 Fast, 2 Furious ... but unfortunately 2 Much","Lucas Black takes the leading role from Paul Walker in this the third outing of the Fast & Furious series, that - unlike the previous two movies - focuses on the art of 'drifting'. Director Justin Lin does a decent enough job here, with a lot to contend with from its superb predecessors. The setting is the streets of Tokyo, Japan, as Lucas Blacks character is shipped off from the US to Japan in order to avoid jail. There he gets involved in the underworld car racing, or should I say car drifting, scene.The acting is average at best, with the relatively unknown Black doing the best he can, but clearly lacking experience. The racing scenes are, as expected, top notch, but the plot just seems silly, and it is these racing scenes that are needed to carry the film through to the end. The main problem with this film is that it really needed a stronger on screen presence, but since none of the original cast returned and all the actors are relatively unknown this was clearly lacking. Overall it was an average attempt at a movie. The action is good but the acting and plot struggle throughout, and I think personally this was significantly lacking when compared to the first two movies. Without spoiling the film, there is a nice surprise during the final couple of minutes, that added a point to my rating, but it wasn't enough. It gets an average rating of 6-10 - watchable.C><",craigy101,2006-07-03,2006,0.046,0.834,0.119,0.9601,Positive
3.0,You can find better activities than this,"I was never a fan of sport/race cars, but it's always interesting to watch high speed and thrilling race. In this movie, only two things may catch your eye - nice chicks, when they appear and good looking cars... and... that's it, folks.It could be quite a good comedy, when you can see a car breaking the speed of 1 Mach (it means velocity of sound, ~330m/s) and when camera suddenly goes to a cabin and shows the speedometer and you see ""WOW! it's whole 90 km/h"" - that's pathetic. Today's scooters can reach that speed at ease.At the final race you can see a secret Japanese ""transportation system"" used. How can people standing at one point film whole race lasting approx. 5 minutes, when cars reach speed of 200 km/h ?? A real phenomenon movie. Film director and screen writer must have been facing brain meltdown, when filming this.By the way, about FX - they totally suck, for example, if you look at the car crash (at about little more than 1h from the start of the movie) you can see a disgusting computer graphics work at it. To be straight I mean, when the 3D parts at the side of the engine are shown.In overall, a nice sci-fi movie (perhaps word ""science"" should be omitted).",Odysei,2006-07-03,2006,0.073,0.778,0.149,0.9612,Positive
10.0,Tokyo Drift will make you drool on yourself.,"If your a big fan of the series like I am, you got to see this movie.First off, the movie stars Lucas Black(Shawn Boswell)who gets in trouble back home and is forced to move to Toyko to live with his dad to avoid jail time.+ The sound effects are awesome, whether it's shifting gears, or hearing the rubber burn off the tires as they drift down the hill, believe me, you will hear the noise. + The music is good especially because it fits in with the whole theme. It seems to me its some kindof Japanese music which is self-explanatory. + The plot was great in my opinion is one of the best action movies of the year! If you want action, and you love the franchise, then you have to see this. You'll be surprised at the end of who shows up. + Not only do you get action, but a little comedy in there. I laughed pretty hard at some of the things Shawn would say. It seems to me that some parts of the movies were dragged out. They could have left some scenes out but overall nothing else is bad about the movie. Hope you like the movie.",ADPollock1188,2006-07-04,2006,0.036,0.789,0.175,0.9851,Positive
9.0,"Wow!! what a movie,","i saw fast and the furious 2 and was really disappointed. when this movie got released i was thinking that it would also be a piece of crap..but i was totally wrong, the film is very well executed. the action scenes were really superb. the story was a little complicated as. why the hell did Hans gave his car's keys to the lead..? he didn't knew him or else. i could not understand that. the cars used in the movie was too good as i love Nissan 350z and skyline GTR. yeah the lead is very bad he doesn't know how to act or deliver dialouges he is just awful..he is shown as a 17 year boy in the movie but he looks like 35..lolif you a car movie fans than this is your ultimate choice.. go enjoy the movie..",Dexter_666,2006-07-04,2006,0.076,0.81,0.114,0.7314,Positive
7.0,Stupid but fun; probably unintentionally.,"While this is one of the stupidest movies ever, it was fun to watch. We ended up regularly laughing with/at the movie and everybody in my group who went to see it said they enjoyed it. When you combined this with the fact that it had some gorgeous women, it was a surprisingly fun movie. Even if you are not up to the Herculean task of suspending disbelief when watching this movie, it can be ""fun"". However, it is not, however, a ""good"" movie. While the adults playing teenagers do not even look the part, the character motivations are incomprehensible, the dialog is puerile, and many of the vehicular stunts are far-fetched, the movie is inexplicably fun to watch (with a group).",garretsr,2006-07-04,2006,0.04,0.768,0.192,0.9678,Positive
8.0,a cool movie that presents modern tokyo and has awesome drifting and action,"i personally LOVED this movie! and so did all my friends who watched it in the theatre with me:]As a overseas military brat, living in japan, and being half Japanese, i could really relate to the movie. Over here, drifting is definitely the cool thing to do. I don't know how popular it is in the states but here, anyone that is into cars is in love with drifting! So it was really cool to see all the action and the awesome stuff the characters did in the movie!The movie actually covers a lot of what japan really is, which makes me really happy. I don't think a lot of Americans really know what modern tokyo is really like. The girls are seriously annorexic! And the fashion is wild! A lot of girls where clothes that BARELY cover them. Short skirts, hooker style. Either that or they have some REALLY weird fashion, uber Gothic, or hair with crazy colors and weird cuts! Some of the things in the movie aren't really accurate, but overall you can see what the real japan is like in this movie! We don't carry samurai swords anymore. sorry...Even if you don't know anything about drifting, you should give this movie a shot, because there is a nice plot to it and the action sequences are amazing. It'll always have you on the edge of your seat, and cringing at every close call or gasping when there is an accident.i haven't seen the other fast and furious movies, but i loved this one and if you like action driven movies, this is the one for you!",meloncoke-1,2006-07-04,2006,0.063,0.769,0.168,0.9899,Positive
3.0,Cheese Fest!,"Where do i start? This movie is just an excuse to flaunt sexy cars and women. There is no real, believable plot. In the first half of the film, it's in too much of a rush to race and it's soooooo cheesy at the beginning when the blonde says ""The winner get's me"". OMG - i was sat in the cinema thinking - do i really have to sit through this!? But it did get better towards the end. I'll be it, I love the race's and beautiful cars (that's why i've given it 3 points) but it's not enough JUST to have that going for it.Okay, does it make sense that three of the main characters are American and one is Austrailian but it's all based in Japan? Maybe the ""army brat"" background could have been feasible for one, but i think they went a bit over the top. If you were going to cast American's as the main characters, base it in America! I hope that the producers decide that this is the last Fast and the Furious. The first two were great, it should have ended there with Paul Walker if you ask me.The ONLY thing i was really impressed with was the soundtrack.",SwampyMcDizzle,2006-07-05,2006,0.028,0.813,0.159,0.9867,Positive
9.0,Great Film...Best out of the Three!,"I watched the first two movies before watching this one and i thought ‘no way is this gonna surpass the first film…’ o man how wrong i was! opening credits...as soon as the film started, it was great, it introduced a young (not cop) character and showed him in his daily life. the first race! omg, best first race out of all the films, 1. raced for a girl and didn't get her which was funny and 2. the race was intense and put you straight into it. moving to Tokyo was great, seeing the customs and changes he had 2 endure then the whole movie took off. the characters all developed well with the story, and i actually felt bad when Han died. the cars were all as usual, great! especially the HULK mobile! lol the final race was off the scale and D.K getting owned by his uncle made everything better! overall.....AWESOME! best out of the three without a doubt, all we have to hope for now is a 4th film with the main 4 guys teaming up or something...lets hope!",nathanhannah_rulez,2006-07-05,2006,0.046,0.755,0.199,0.9855,Positive
10.0,And we live in To-Ki-Yo,"Great movie, I actually liked it the best out of the three films. Really animated jokes, great stunts, and one of the things I liked best is how true they kept the Japanese element, with the high school and other cultural differences.The ten second appearance of Vin Diesal only made it that much better, and honestly, The movie pulled me into it's world so much that I wanted nothing more then to go try my hand at drifting :) and hopefully not die from the experience.Another delight was the fact that Bow Wow is actually an Actor! Something that with everyone in Hollywood trying every job I as very Skeptical of, and yet he did it amazingly, Great Job all around to the cast!",EchosSorrow04,2006-07-05,2006,0.016,0.636,0.349,0.9952,Positive
10.0,mustang's new engine,"The engine in the mustang is not a RX-7 motor it is a 4cyc. out of a Silvia S15 this is the Japanese version of the 240SX both made by Nissan. And the motor would fit in the engine bay of the mustang. Other than that the movie was very very very good, but to all of those people out there who think drifting is easy, you are wrong, drifting is very hard a should NOT be attempted on the streets. Drifting is a motor sport which should be left on the track. this fast and the furious is the best yet, and if there are more to come i hope that the movie makers find a better way to keep the attention of the audience, because Tokyo drift was action from the start to the finish.",fireball138,2006-07-06,2006,0.07,0.796,0.134,0.8814,Positive
6.0,Practical,"Summer movies, what a zone to enter! What a collection of thrills, disappointments and adventures of different kinds! Sometimes for me they take me to a sublime place: ""King Kong,"" ""Van Helsing."" Most times its just noise.If its cinematic, I'll credit it with space in my life. Yes, I know the first two F&F were considered dumb, not worthy. Some of that I think is a residual class bias in the US. Muscle cars and racing has always been a trailer park thing. True enough and the stories, all three of them are cluttered with cultural touchstones: dumb, honest, sublegal. And the trailer park notion of girls as prizes.Well, if you are serious about movies, you pretty much ignore the stories. And in summer movies you know the icons transcend their cultural places and move to a grander cinematic place. So a hillbilly isn't a hillbilly, more of a hillbillybillboard. The real appeal is in whether it is cinematic or not. Now this is a tricky issue, and a matter of taste. Tarantino, for example, obnoxiously advertises the cinematic overloading of ""Bill,"" but that's just inventory, right? The Coens seem more genuine and satisfying. But with the Fast and Furious projects, the idea was a nostalgic one, to recall an obsolete cinematic value: the car chase. More, to do it without computer graphics, but with camera angles now common from the CGI era. In movielanguage, this is called doing it ""practically,"" meaning with real cars, mountains, cameras.Computer graphics is still enough artificial that we know the difference. That matrix highway fight or any one of the mission impossible deals might be exciting, but there's an extra edge to knowing that something is real. Like a Buster Keaton or Harold Lloyd stunt. The first F&F simply mined this. I liked it enough to consider my cinematic mind massaged. The second one obviously responded to market research that showed huge ticket sales in Asia. So they retooled the whole thing, both in the story (Asian girls, Asian cars), in the style (neon) and in the film-making itself.A huge hit in Asia. US viewers were almost disposable.Now this third one: actually set in Tokyo though filmed in LA. Its a step down in style: the production design is not nearly as polished and cool, instead it is more industrial, cheaper to do. The F&F production sponsors clearly are settling in for the long haul where they can make one of these every year or so indefinitely. Oddly, the sexy bodies  traditionally the cheapest thing you can get  are played down in this one.Anyway, the real value in this is the camera rush. There's some cool folding at the race at the end where phonecams merge with the cameras we see through. We become the spectators on the side of the road.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",tedg,2006-07-06,2006,0.05,0.828,0.122,0.9901,Positive
8.0,An action flick that thrives on its unique style and cinematography,"As a loyal fan to modified cars, I very much enjoyed watching The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift and would highly recommend it. I feel that this movie successfully differentiated itself from the other two movies in the franchise to create a new ""Fast-paced"" viewing experience as well as highlight the directors style. Despite views from critics, I hold this movie in high regards for what it has, rather than what it lacks in the acting and storyline department.What I most enjoyed about this movie was its perspective, and style utilized in displaying the action. Not only did it use unique camera angles and cinematography, the techniques and devices in general were well suited to the location and essence that the movie delivers. It is set in Tokyo, where fast cars, latest fashion, and state-of-the-art gadgets are abundant. To compliment this, my favorite cinematography device was the camera shots through the mobile phones. Personally I found that worked exceptionally well, and made for some great eye candy.I pity all critics that denote this movie in terms of acting, plot etc. What they seem to understand is that this sort of movie criteria is important and must be executed. What they don't understand is that this movie criteria is unessential for this genre of movie. Any survey done on behalf of this movie will prove that viewers of this action genre, come to see action and great visuals, rather than big name actors and intellectually challenging plots.I give this movie a generous 7/10 simply because i felt the action was unique, which included never before seen cinematography. Critics can say what they may about the acting, or the storyline, yet it is important to realize that this criteria was executed adequately, and that the movie was successful in delivering a great viewing experience.",EdwinTetlow141,2006-07-06,2006,0.029,0.786,0.184,0.9941,Positive
4.0,This one's all smoke and mirrors,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, or 3 Fast 3 Furious as my friends jokingly called it, is the story of a troubled youth who is sent to Tokyo to his father in hopes he will stop his ways as a trouble maker and buckle down and focus on school. However, instead of focusing on school he falls in with a crowd of street racers who specialize in the racing style of ‘drifting’. Throw in some crap about the Yakuza (japanese mafia) and a protagonist who has the usual hissy fit about the main character ‘talking to his girl’ and you have a typical bland modern special effects show-off crap-a-rama. The writers throw together the usual Fast and the Furious storyline of a bunch of people who do nothing all day and race at night in cars that might cost more than your average American home, yet these people are not even slightly remorseful when the presumably 6 figure car is absolutey totaled. In fact most of the time they can be seen a few scenes later in another extremely expensive car that seems to build itself out of nowhere. This story is pretty much the exact same as 2 Fast 2 Furious, except it's in Japan. The acting isn't anything spectacular, in some spots it's downright poor. The race scenes are little drawn out and get boring after awhile. It's the usual cookie cutter action movie, forbidden love story-check, rich over privledged immature protagonist-check, crime syndicate tie in-check. There really isn't much story to spoil, it plays out exactly as you would imagine. Only go to see this one if you really cars or crappy cookie cutter modern movies.",Hungry-Dingo,2006-07-06,2006,0.126,0.796,0.079,-0.9461,Negative
10.0,The best among the three,"I just saw this film last Friday. This movie made my contact lens dry for not blinking my eyes because it was just thrilling and a little exciting. It has got the best stunts, the background music really suited in this movie. For me, this is the best the fast and the furious have ever made so far. Lucas Black's character as Sean is good for him. It made him look hot. He had to go in Japan to not be in the jail. Though he's forbidden to race he's still do it, thanks to Twinkie he showed a little world of best cars to Sean. I like the car of Twinkie here, cool, huh? Anyway, it reminds me the Japanese Anime Initial D because they both just pretty alike, Sean reminds me the main protagonist Takumi and Sean's father reminds me the father of Takumi. I like Sean here, he's very well-determined and practice for him makes him perfect to drift. This movie is good for the car lovers, if you want to drift, think first what would be may happen to you.",Erollynx,2006-07-30,2006,0.03,0.761,0.209,0.9894,Positive
4.0,expected better,"Tonight I watched the fast and the furious: Tokyo Drift.The drifting is fun to watch, but a campy plot and too much development time makes attempting to deepen an already shallow storyline seem much too overbearing. The acting, while not terrible is nothing great and the character's personalities are forced and way over the top. While this isn't a big surprise to anyone who has watched the other movies in series, the lack of well known cast members made it more apparent then usual. Plus, there is almost no police intervention in this one. even as a car drifts into a massive crowd of people and seconds later explodes, causing chaos.Apparently in Tokyo, the police don't mess with street racers because they can't catch them. Seriously, that's how it's explained.On the plus side of things, plenty of eye-candy can be found everywhere, and I'm not just talking about the cars. Japanese women are all portrayed as beautiful and stylish import girls, and their tiny vinyl skirts are just about as shiny as the finish on the cars. One thing must be said though. Japanese men are no where near as pretty as their women here. I'm sure some will disagree, but wow. Someone get those boys a mirror.Overall, it's not a dreadful film as there are some high points particularly during some racing stunts, but it's odd how young everyone is. Appparently the lead character isn't even out of high school. Right from the introduction the film generalizes what audience this movie geared towards. What makes this even dumber is how what they are doing is illegal. Bunch of kids disobeying the law and the cops could care less.It's rather mediocre for the most part and the only thing compelling me to recommend it for would be the racing, but i feel that there isn't even enough of that to balance this movie out.Pretty disappointing.",thefuzmixman,2006-06-01,2006,0.107,0.772,0.122,0.6868,Positive
