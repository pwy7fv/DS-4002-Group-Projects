7.0,The last one about actual racing?,"Look behind the woeful accent and this is actually a good movie. The first F&F was about racing, then went all Miami Vice. A final return to the street racing scene had to move away from the original cast as they had lost their 'From the streets' appeal.Anyway back to this, some sweet cars that aren't the massively expensive hyper cars of later episodes and some trick driving to boot.A quality film if you manage to watch it a couple of times and don't dwell on the accent.",sarnieken,2021-03-28,2021
7.0,For the most part a good car action flick.,"The first film was BREAK POINT with cars. The second one was Miami VICE with cars. This is REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE... with more cars. To be honest, I kinda liked this one better than the last two, despite Lucas Black somehow beating Paul Walker as the least charismatic actor in a starring role. What I mainly like is the direction by Justin Lin. The focus on police undercover stories is dropped in favor of the street racing culture and its connections to the mob. Was actually delighted to see Sonny Chiba appear, I must have missed his name during the opening credits. Purely as a movie about car action, I think it succeeds better than the first two. There's a goofy quality to it that kinda helps one go along with things. Best to sum that up is Lucas Black smiling like a dork with blood on his teeth, living for the thrill. That's probably what this film series needed, and less soap opera/undercover drama. Consider me surprised.",tmm_8705,2013-06-28,2013
7.0,Surprisingly good - Sung Kang steals the show,"I'm getting the feeling that the majority of reviews here as of June 14th are bogus. Why write a review if you've only seen the trailer for the film? Anyway, I had the opportunity to see this movie yesterday. Yeah, this is the one of those film series people will hate before seeing. It's over the top, has cheesy dialogue, and has an unlikeable protagonist. With that said, it's actually pretty entertaining, and isn't all that bad. We are introduced to Sean Boswell (Lucas Black), a high school kid who can't seem to find his niche in life. He's moved from town to town with his divorced mother, and getting into problems with the law, before finding himself in Southern California. The California scenes pay homage to Justin Lin's earlier film, Better Luck Tomorrow, almost feeling like an extension of that film. We see the crowds of students in the courtyard, almost peripheral to a particular point in time. Moving to California doesn't change anything, and Sean, the outsider, finds himself racing Clay (Zachery Ty Bryan, from Home Improvement), a rich kid who has it all, including a brand new Dodge Viper. In trouble with the law yet again, Sean finds himself moving to Japan, for reasons that aren't particularly clear. We don't know exactly why he *had* to move; however, it doesn't really matter anyway. Sean continues to find himself as an outsider. From his distant father, to his language barrier, to being unfamiliar with traditional customs. Unlike other particular American films, the culture of Japan was portrayed in a positive light. This was particularly refreshing, as the food jokes, Engrish jokes, height jokes, etc. have become very tiresome over the years. Sean meets Twinkie (Lil Bow Wow), and Han (Sung Kang), the latter of which appears to be the same character from Better Luck Tomorrow. Both Twinkie and Han serve as guides or mentors to Sean, as he becomes more familiar with Japan, school, drifting, and its associated group. In retrospect, Twinkie seems like an unnecessary character, and quickly gets shelved to Sung Kang's Han, who steals the show like a pimp. Sean also meets, and is attracted to Neela (Nathalie Kelley), who is the girlfriend of DK (Brian Tee). DK is a nickname for 'Drift King.' Sean quickly realizes this as he loses badly to him in his first race in Japan (and smashing up Han's S15 badly). The altercation between Sean and DK heats up leading to the climax of the film. Sean Boswell is an unlikeable character. His mannerism is interesting during the California scenes and you actually do get to like him, however he quickly outwears his welcome. From his unjustified temper, to his grating southern accent, Han becomes more of the likable protagonist. The dialogue was cheesy as hell too (remember the 'I'm free' line from the first one? This is worse - the moonlight drifting scene is embarrassingly bad). Character development is too hurried at times, much like this review. As with Kill Bill, Sonny Chiba is as charming as ever, this time playing a Yakuza boss, who happens to be the uncle of DK. Now, the racing scenes were actually not that bad. Compared to the outlandish effects of the first two FF films, Tokyo Drift is pretty understated. Racing-wise, this was a vendor-fest. 350Z's (VERY prominently displayed), RX-8's, and an EVO. Other than that, there was an R34 GT-R, S15, and the Veilside RX-7. That's really about it (with the obvious exception of the Mustang). I think I saw a glimpse of an AE86 hatch. Will it make people drift in the parking lot leaving the theatre? Yes. In fact, I saw some guy in a Camry attempting to do so. Will it spark interest in the vendor-sponsored cars? Probably. Will it increase resale value of your S13 or AE86? Probably not. Finally, there are two notable cameos in this film (among others). The first cameo has to do with 'DK' (not the film character). The second cameo ties the film to its predecessor. Both appearances were pretty well done and drew laughter from the crowd.",accidentalist,2006-06-14,2006
6.0,"The drivers, the cars and the Drift races are the real stars of this movie , well directed on Tokyo location","This is an exciting narration of drifting auto racing with exceptionally fine camera work and great car chase sequences and crashes on the metropolitan streets. It deals about a rebel American adolescent named Shawn Boswell(Lucas Black as a determined race-car driver) challenges his contender for a race cars, causing wreak havoc racing 195 mph through streets. To avoid the jail, his mother(Lynda Boyd) sends him Tokyo where is his father(Brian Goodman) as US military. Meanwhile the newcomer Shawn tries to ingratiate with Twinkie(Nathalie Kelley) and the world of racing in Japan, and hoping to join his extended group. In Tokio he discovers the underworld of the Yazuka and competes against Drift kingpin who is niece of mobster chief(Sonny Chiba who does a credible job).The picture mingles action-packed,drama, exciting pursuits cars, suspense, a little bit of violence and spectacular sequences though won't mean much on little screen TV. Flashy, noisy race-cars set in the Japan by the producers, -the famous Neal Moritz-of first part. Pulse-quickening action but plenty of clichés and lots of dirty driving and heavier on crashes than coherency. All stunts were performed by authentic experts without people damage. Special cameo by Vin Diesel and appearance by Sonny Chiba, a Kung Fu idol of the 70s. Justin Lin's direction(previously made Annapolis and Better Luck tomorrow) is competent though the story eventually run out of gas. Justin Lin is directing the third part with Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster. The movie gives new meaning to the term ¨Tuning¨and ¨Drifting¨. The flick will like to adrenaline lovers and those young people looking for strong emotions. This is the kind of film in which the cars enthusiastic will enjoy immensely, it's a must see for cars fonds.",ma-cortes,2008-04-08,2008
7.0,"Decent, Hardly any substance, But Sometime to watch :D","What can I say about this movie that many haven't already noted? Well first of all I saw this movie twice, and probably shouldn't have. The cinematography was phenomenal and the racing sequences were jaw dropping. Unfortunately, this movie lacks substance. The storyline was really iffy and probably not likely to happen and the acting was a little shaky.But thats not the reason why everyone goes to watch this movie. We all go to see the cars and the girls which fortunately delivers. Beautiful cars, beautiful ladies and beautiful scenery and destructive driving is never in short supply in this genre and the scenery of Japan is just breathtaking. All in all, just a movie you'll want to see with the boys.",andykhiem87,2006-08-01,2006
7.0,"""One car in exchange for knowing what a man's made of? That's a price I can live with.""","FILM: 7.0
Rewatching the 2006 film The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, I find myself enjoying it more than most people seem to. So, here's an unpopular opinion: Tokyo Drift ties as my third favourite film in the series. The film ramps up the fun straight away, ditches the cheese of the second instalment, and goes for an original plot.One of the aspects I appreciate most about Tokyo Drift is its unique setting and storyline. Shifting the focus to Tokyo and introducing the world of drift racing feels fresh and exciting. The races and chases are some of the series' best, with a kinetic energy that keeps me engaged throughout. The soundtrack is another highlight, with its thumping beats perfectly complementing the high-speed action.I know people heap crap on it for not keeping it in the ""family,"" but it's an undeniably fun ride. The absence of the core characters initially feels strange, but the new cast manages to hold their own. Lucas Black as Sean Boswell brings a different kind of protagonist to the table, and I find his journey from outsider to drift racing aficionado quite compelling.The character of Han, played by Sung Kang, is a standout. His cool, mentor-like presence adds depth to the film and makes for some memorable moments. The Tokyo setting is visually stunning, and the film makes excellent use of its locations, showcasing the vibrant cityscape in a way that's both thrilling and immersive.What I like about Tokyo Drift is its ability to balance the adrenaline-pumping action with a story that feels grounded. The film doesn't rely on the over-the-top stunts that the later entries in the series do, and that simpler approach works in its favour.Overall, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a fairly positive experience that brings something fresh and exciting to the franchise. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, I find it to be a fun and engaging film that stands out in its own right.FORMAT: Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.0

6.0,The Cars do the talking.,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift Directed by Justin Lin Starring: Mitsubishi Evo 9, Nissan Silva, Ford Mustang, RX 7, Toyota Chaser, Lucas Black, Bow Wow, Nathalie Kelly, Sung Kang, Sonny ChibaI think the Mitsubishi should get a best actor nomination for next year's Oscars.Nice cars. Nice music. Nice bodies. Nice cityscape.Brainless story. But that's what I watched it for, to have my brains parked outside the cinema and let the brainlessness drive me through a two hour entertainment.The RX7 has more expression than all the actors.C - Because it served its purpose in entertaining me with awesome drifts, over-sized exhaust pipes, and kick butt photography for a car racing film.",superratty-tmy,2006-06-23,2006
5.0,The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is far better than I expected - but I had low expectations. Enjoyable but not critically appealing,"I was quite surprised by The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift. Of course, I expected it to be a pile of steaming garbage, particularly with the formula of increasingly dodgy sequels. So when I went to see it with some friends, I had obvious misgivings. These misgivings, or at least the worst ones, such as the movie being unbearable to even look at, were fortunately unfounded. I kept my eyes on the movie the whole time, mainly because of the souped cars, but the fact that I went through the movie without flinching (a lot, except at some of the bad dialogue that was prevalent), says quite a lot. Maybe my view of The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift is heightened by the fact that I cracked a few jokes during the movie.Now down to business. Sean, a 'dude' who loves to race at high speeds for no apparent reason, is sent to Tokyo to live with his military dad and ends up being drawn to the racing circuit again, witnessing a new style of race called 'drift' (as seen in Need For Speed Underground, to those that don't know). Sounds stupid? Well, it is, the casual viewer can detect a plothole or two from even reading those two lines. To go on, except to state that Sean ends up making friends with a guy named Han, is pointless. I will admit that no-one looks for a good plot in a Fast and the Furious movie, but still, the less said, the better.The dialogue, as I stated, can be funny - because of its stupidity. This is shown by one piece of dialogue where some guy asks Sean: ""You know what DK stands for?"" and Sean replies ""Donkey Kong"". At least its original, I guess.The acting is OK - far from turgid, which I expected it to be in the first place. The guy who plays Han is surprisingly good, going through the movie without looking as if he was hired from a nearby sushi bar. Brian Tee as DK is a bit of a joke, he is more comedic than menacing. Lucas Black is OK as Sean, but his Southern accent makes his character more irritating to watch. The love interest does well as eye candy. That's about all that matters I guess.The most important part of The Fast and the Furious is inarguably the racing sequences and their overall effectiveness. I will admit that the sequences themselves are well-filmed and eye catching, highlighting the cars, as they should. However, except in a few fleeting moments, they are not as enthralling as they should be and this is one of the most disappointing aspects of The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift. The final confrontation, for me, is pretty good to watch, but only arouses the senses once in a while.Time didn't drag though, which is a clear sign that The Fast and Furious is indeed quite watchable, despite its other pre-eminent faults. I admit that I didn't really get bored during the film, which may lead to my rose-tinted view of it (compared to my original perception of what it would be like).So let me summarise my thoughts: ""Didn't expect much, got more than I bargained for."" The acting is satisfactory (for a racing film, otherwise it would more or less suck), the plot and the dialogue are predictably terrible, the racing sequences are satisfactory and the cinematography is somewhat effective, with frequent close-ups of the cars. What compels me to give The Fast and The Furious a pass grade is the fact that it is, like I said, quite watchable. However, it is still little more than satisfactory, so it's rating cannot therefore rise above:2.5/5 stars",DaRick89,2006-06-21,2006
8.0,MOST UNDERRATED OF THE SERIES!!,"I absolutely love this film, it moves over to Tokyo where instead its just pure speed we get the taste of the drift makes it kind of Need for Speedish. The protagonist is quite forgettable but we are introduced to Han and the best racing to date.",patches89,2021-08-17,2021
7.0,A new cast in a new city,"This film may be part of the 'Fast and the Furious' series but, apart from a brief cameo, it features an entirely different cast. Instead of being centred on undercover cop Brian O'Conner it follows teenager Sean Boswell who is sent to live with his father in Tokyo after destroying his car in a street race. His father forbids him from having anything to do with cars but it isn't long before a classmate introduces him to the local 'drift racing' scene. Here he has a run in with DK, the best racer and nephew of a local Yakuza, who isn't happy about Sean talking to his girlfriend. Sean challenges him to a race and DK's friend Han Seoul-Oh lends him a car which he promptly destroys; if he is going to race he will have to learn how to drift. Han teaches him how to drift while Sean works for him to earn the money to pay for the wrecked car. It isn't long before DK and Han's friendship ends when it becomes apparent that Han has been skimming money. This ultimately puts Sean in his sights; Tokyo isn't big enough for the both of them; a drift race down a treacherous mountain road will determine who stays. At first I was a little bit disappointed that the character Brian O'Conner wasn't in this as the first two films were about him. New character Sean Boswell is entertaining and Lucas Black does a good job in the role even though he looks too old to be in high school. I can't think why they didn't make the character older as that would have also have avoided the ludicrous idea that an American teen who doesn't speak a word of Japanese would go to a Tokyo high school. Still this film is all about the characters racing their cars and the race scenes are exciting; this is particularly true of the final race down what looked like the most dangerous road in Japan. The appearance of Sonny Chiba as DK's Yakuza uncle was enjoyable and a cameo from a familiar character should leave fans very happy as the film comes to an end. Overall I enjoyed this as good mindless fun even though it is weaker than the first two films.",Tweekums,2015-12-17,2015
3.0,Slightly Entertaining Movie with bad actors and worst story,"This movie starts as expected and pretty entertaining, involving some street racing, and some 17yo who obviously doesn't fit in 'Sport America' and the whole high-school thing. I gotta say, from the first time I saw the main actor, and he going through the metal detectors, I tried to imagine he was going to an airport, then a university, even with cheerleaders, football teams and all the cliché that comes with movies presenting high schools, I thought that, because they casted a 23yo guy that looks like a 32yo, I'm still actually having trouble believing that the actor is only 23 years old. Sean 17 years old, played by Lucas Black, age 23, but looks 32, is the average American, with a slightly heavy, bad and annoying southern accent with a cowboy style goes to Tokyo after a race ends badly, there he meets with another bunch of 17yo who also look like in their late 20's, early 30's, and all have money, cars and lots of girls, including the main one, Neela, played by Nathalie Kelley, who obviously, gets disputed by both Sean, and his comic-book 'arch-villain' D.K.. The problem with the cast was with the choice for Sean and Neela, the first for being a bad actor and all of the reasons listed above, the latter because I think they injected her with so much botox, that except her mouth moving and eyes blinking and shedding some fake tears, you don't see any kind of facial expression whatsoever, the rest of the cast was good, even the Japanese playing the badly made character, D.K.. The story gets ridiculous from the minute Sean arrives in Tokyo, after school, he meets his demographically chosen friend and goes see the 'underground world of car racing', there he sees Neela again and from the start gets entangled in a love triangle involving the yakuza bad boy D.K., so, Sean challenges him for a race, oh wait, he doesn't have a car, no problem, some guy who never saw Sean before, or even knows his name, lends his 100k car, well, Sean trashes the car during the race, and that way, hey he made a new powerful friend, Han the Zen, all he did was trash his car. Anyway, some scenes of Sean learning how to drift happen, over and over and over and over and over again, some flirting with Neela, anyway, he end up winning a race from one of D.K.'s drivers, after that some news happen, Han is stealing from D.K., so some fighting ensues, Hans gets f-cked and then Sean decides to go talk with the Yakuza master of the region, D.K.'s uncle, he gives the uncle some money and propose some peaceful solution, a race between D.K. and Sean, nevermind that the fight was already over, Hans was dead and Sean had nothing to offer, or was any kind of threat to anyone, but hey, this is a sequel, so, 3 Fast and 3 Furious, some racing ensues with a predictable ending. One thing that was very enjoyable in this movie, was the street racing, those scenes were made in such a professional way, that one can only wish that the rest of the crew had the same competence, also those scenes remembered me a lot of Need for Speed, specially in the initial sequence, when some shortcut is taken, doesn't really try to distant itself when it puts some of the same soundtrack, which is also the only other positive point of the movie, of course, the producers had to ruin that also, the final street racing is by far the poorest, with all the curves looking the same, in the mountains, and some cellphones videos for some street racing fans. Any, this was a very bad movie, with a terrible story and even worst main cast, but with some decent supporting cast, good soundtrack and excellent street racing scenes, but I still don't recommend.",kok_warlock,2006-06-24,2006
10.0,UNDERRATED Movie ! Totally,This is the only movie about cars racing and after this they are only fighting between each other . Why this movie do not earn more at box office i don't understand. But for me this movie is best in franchise after fast five.,rajjindal-72925,2020-09-24,2020
7.0,'Furious' will have hearts racing,"As expected, it doesn't take long for '’The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift’ to hit the gas. As the film opens, we meet Sean (Lucas Black), the new kid at a Southern high school who's harboring a need for speed. After Sean ruffles the feathers of a resident jock (Zachery Ty Bryan), a scantily clad girl suggests, ‘Why don't you boys let the cars do the talking?’ And so the adrenaline rush begins. ‘Lost in Translation’ with a driver's license, the third installment of the popular franchise takes its car chases and souped-up engines to the Far East. Fans of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker will miss the tough-talking duo, but the mean streets of Japan deliver some action-packed goods. Of course, don't expect more than a load of eye candy and the regular rumbles. The flashy drama begins when Sean is shipped to Tokyo to avoid jail time and live with his strict, military officer dad (Brian Goodman). Making nice with the tough crowd, the American befriends Twinkie (Bow Wow), an army brat with a car that looks like it came straight out of ‘Pimp My Ride.’ It isn't long before Sean is taking test drives with a new set of wheels, not to mention getting on the bad side of the mafia-affiliated DK (Brian Tee) and falling for his girl, Neela (Nathalie Kelley). Directed by Justin Lin (‘Better Luck Tomorrow’), ‘The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift’ is injected with testosterone and saturated in masculinity. Branded a gaijin (Japanese for foreigner), Sean tries to master the driving skill of drifting while trying to impress his crush and settle the score with DK and his crew. What's the best way to solve the world's problems? Racing, of course. Sure, it's not the wittiest, smartest or most memorable piece of cinema. But the film delivers everything it promised: loud music, loud cars and a whole lot of glitz.",I_Like_Turtle_s,2006-06-15,2006
3.0,Worst of the trilogy,"The first movie was good, the second not so much...this one is terrible.
The main actor has to be one of the worst I've ever seen, he sounds like Forrest Gump and his 'acting' is like a child at a school play. The cars were good and some of the women nice to look at so if that's what you're here for you'll probably enjoy it.",Narcissist00,2020-05-22,2020
7.0,Improvement over the previous installment,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is an improvement over the previous installment. Lucas Black and Sung Kang give great performances. Justin Lin's direction is great and the new location breathes new life into the franchise with some of the best car chases yet, even if the plot is nothing new.",masonsaul,2019-07-26,2019
6.0,I enjoyed this movie,"I actually really enjoyed this movie. I love the location, cool race scenes, surprisingly interesting plot and overall a lot of fun.

6.0,"Tokyo ""Drift""","The only interesting part of this movie is the drifting. That's all. The cast is fine but the depth of the character is just meh (except for Han who had a good motive). The story and plot lack some tension, especially the Yakuza part. Why the hell Yakuza was described so weak in this movie.",aldrichianata,2020-08-30,2020
6.0,Far better than the previous two,"Well, it is rather odd that IMDb is labeling this movie as a romance because I would hardly say that it is a romance beyond any other action movie that has a romantic element in it (and there are very few action movies that don't have a romantic element in them, but just because boy gets girl doesn't make the movie a romance). Anyway, what surprised me about this film is that there was no connection between this film and the last two (with the exception of a Vin Diesal cameo), and further more it didn't follow the lines of an undercover cop come drag racer infiltrating an illegal drag racing ring. In fact this film is probably more what the first film should have been as opposed to what it turned out as (though we should note that this film is set in Japan as opposed to the United States so there are some cultural differences that are relevant).So what we have in this film is the story of a rebel, Sean, who get his first speeding ticket the day after he got his driver's license, and is a bit of a loner namely because his carefree attitude means that his mother has to keep on moving. Anyway he lands up in another drag race which results in the destruction of two cars and a housing estate, and since the other participants have really rich parents he is the one who has to take the rap. So, he is sent to Japan to live with his father. The problem is that this is the type of guy that always seems to find trouble, and since he is a gaijin (non-Japanese), he ends up hanging with the other gaijin, and gets involved with illegal street racing there as well. The thing is that racing in Japan is vastly different from racing in the United States. Whereas in the US you have flat surfaces and long straight roads, you don't have that in Japan. As such racing here involves going up and down carparking lots and mountains in a form of racing called 'drifting'. Basically drifting involves navigating tight turns at high speeds without causing damage to the car, and winning the race. This is something Sean doesn't realise when he lands up in this new world – the rules of racing back in the United States – the 10 second race – don't apply here. In a way this film is similar to the other films, but different, and a part of me feels that this addition to the franchise kicked it off to the extent that it is now up to film number seven, though the rumour was that the actors in the previous films were not too keen on coming back and that this was going to be a reboot. However, what impressed me was that the story was completely different, though I would hardly call it original. In a sense it is one of those fish out of water stories, the story of a guy that simply wants to belong but has a lot of trouble doing so. We see this at the beginning of the film where we seems to wander around without any real friends. Obviously this changes once he gets to Japan since being different he is able to attract others who are different as well. Mind you, the one criticism that I do have of the film is that Sean clearly knows no Japanese so it makes me wonder how it is that he is going to learn anything in a Japanese school (and it was pretty clear that they taught in Japanese). Also, isn't it interesting that they always go after the girl that they can't have, and eventually get her. It doesn't really send a strong message to our impressionable youth. Mind you, the fact that the two protagonists in this film refer to women as 'their girls' doesn't do much in the way of dismantling the objectification of women, and further that one of the girls puts herself forward as the prize for the winner of the race is even worse. No wonder Hillary lost.",The-Sarkologist,2016-12-03,2016
1.0,The Slow and The Stupid: Part III,"I enjoyed the first two films, which were better than average popcorn flicks, but this (almost) completely unrelated crapfest is a complete waste of your filmgoing dollars. It's ridiculous and it's boring. The main character, Sean, is a 34 year old street racer who has apparently been held back in school....for seventeen years. He's the oldest high school student on Planet Earth. In fact, in a remarkable feat of human biology, he is about the same age as his mother and father! He also has the most improbable and unconvincing Southern US accent imaginable. After smashing up some cars and destroying an entire housing development, he is sent to live in Japan with his Navy dad (who apparently fathered him at the age of about 9). For reasons never explained, his father is not allowed to live on the Naval base, but has to reside in a minuscule Japanese slum and Sean (yup, still in high school, despite middle age) doesn't go to the Navy base school, where instruction would be in English, but instead is enrolled at a private Japanese academy despite the fact that he knows not a single word of Japanese. Apparently no one, not even his teachers there, seem to think this will be a problem. Naturally, the first girl he sees in class is the only Caucasian student in the entire school, if not the entire city, and so she becomes the (very boring) love interest. He also meets the only African American student. Obviously these two must be his best friend and girlfriend since they are the only non-Asians around. Subsequently, he gets into ‘drift racing’, something I never heard of before and I can see why. It's not very interesting to watch. Apparently it consists of taking a small import vehicle with front wheel drive, and while going fast through a sharp turn, allowing the car to fishtail. While this seems possible enough (for a skilled stunt driver on a closed track, per the credits), I do wonder if it is possible to do this continuously while driving, i.e., to essentially drive sideways almost the entire time. Seriously, I doubt this. It's also not especially fast, which makes it fairly dull to watch. Also, the big ‘final race’ occurs, and the hero's dad (amazingly) has the body of a classic 60s Mustang in his garage (a somewhat unlikely situation in Japan -- not just the car, but the idea that he has a entire garage for this purpose in one of the world's most expensive and crowded cities). So Sean and his friends take the engine out of one of the Japanese cars he has wrecked earlier in the film, and in a few hours they manage to install this into the 60s muscle car. HELLO? Is this possible? I admit I am not a mechanic or specialist, but it does not seem logical that you could retrofit a Japanese front wheel drive engine into a vintage 60s American rear wheel drive car....if it could be done AT ALL, it seems to me that it would take a long time and involve a lot of custom parts. That's not even considering that they drive on the opposite side of the road in Japan, or that a 60s era car would be much heavier than a current model Japanese car. There are too many other absurdities to list, along with the inclusion of the Yakuza (Japanese mafia). I wish I could say that ‘Toyko Drift’ was campy, or that you could have a good time just laughing at the many absurdities, but actually its fatal flaw is that it is extremely dull. The least you would expect from it, title- wise, is that there would be lots of exciting racing -- and there isn't -- and that the hero would probably have a hot, sexy Japanese girlfriend and sexy love scenes -- and there is absolutely nothing in this regard (as he's barely hooked up with the only Caucasian woman in his high school). The film is entirely devoid of sex appeal, you could show it to a convention of Mormons. SPOILER ALERT Because it's so dumb and utterly lame, I am alerting anyone (who has seen the TV ads) that Vin Diesel does appear, in his role from the first film, for a few seconds at the very end. It's stupid and it's gratuitous, and it says something terribly sad about both this film, and Mr. Diesel's career (that he was able to be compelled to appear, even uncredited). This is a franchise with every ounce of the life juice sucked out. Here is hoping that they never, ever consider making ‘Fast & Furious IV’.",LilyDaleLady,2006-07-30,2006
10.0,Tokio Drift is a very good film,"For everyone who likes action and car films Fast and the Fourious Tokio Drift will be very good for you.

6.0,A slight departure for the franchise.,"When teenage road-racer Sean Boswell (Lucas Black, who is too old for the part, but hey-ho) gets in trouble with the law for a third time, he avoids a jail sentence by going to live with his father in Tokyo; there, he becomes involved in the drift racing scene, coming to blows with DK (Brian Tee), the nephew of a powerful Yakuza.Tokyo Drift gets short shrift from some Fast & Furious fans because it steers the franchise away from the US street racing scene and because it doesn't star series regular Paul Walker. While it might be a slight step down from the previous entries, being a little too teen-centric with its predictably troublesome high school protagonist, I don't think it's all that bad. As a fan of all things Japanese, I can appreciate the colourful Tokyo setting, the Yakuza storyline, and, of course, all those oriental cuties in extremely short skirts.Director Justin Lin, who went on to helm parts 4, 5 and 6 in the series, handles the car scenes with aplomb, each race shifting up a gear in terms of adrenaline-pumping action. Drifting—sliding the car around sharp corners at high speed—adds a new level of excitement to the action, with a mountain road finale offering plenty of nerve jangling, edge-of-the-seat moments. The film closes with the reappearance of a familiar face, paving the way for further instalments.",BA_Harrison,2015-12-20,2015
2.0,laughably stupid threadbare plot,"An incurable addicted-to-speed young racer, Lucas Black, escapes to Tokyo to avoid jail after repeated arrests for racing. He joins his father, (who is estranged from his mother), in Tokyo where he runs into problems with other local race-aholics. The young American vies for the attention of gal who is linked to local Japanese racer, and the two rivals for affection eventually butt heads. This is the extent of plot you get in this tire-screeching, attitude and hormone churning, low-brow flick, where almost every character seems to be suffering from some form of personality disorder, or is just plain stupid. Somehow, in spite of a glaring lack of insight or smarts, the protagonist, a refugee from high school ""shop"" classes where he learned to work on cars, seems to master the Japanese language effortlessly. The Japanese characters in the flick are equally repulsive, or more so, as most are no more than thugs, with our hero's Japanese rival wrapped up in a Yakuza (Mafia) family. The movie is just a ""loser to bruiser"" story, as the young American masters the Japanese racing style, with flashy fast cars providing the backdrop for our hero's transformation. The movie does offer a generous supply of laughs, but I don't think that's what the director and company had intended.",dmuel,2006-09-05,2006
8.0,"""Tokyo Drift"" Charts A Change of Pace","‘Better Luck Tomorrow’ director Justin Lin's ‘The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift’ qualifies as a departure from the norm for a franchise. First, the action takes place in Asia instead of Los Angeles. Second, until the ending, we don't see anybody familiar. Although the hero is a misunderstood misfit, he isn't anything like the major characters in the previous films. Lucas Black plays a high school kid who is attracted to trouble, but he isn't a professional thief or a public servant. As Sean Boswell, he winds up in Tokyo and has to prove himself in an entirely different culture. Inevitably, our hero clashes with the nephew of a Yakuza boss played by the legendary martial arts superstar Sonny Chiba. Lin does a terrific job orchestrating some complicated action, especially the scenes where drivers drift. The drifting here, particularly during a town race, is breathtaking stuff. On the basis of its stunt driving, ‘The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift’ ranks as a good movie. Of course, the Chris Morgan screenplay is shallow, but he fills the action with interesting characters. Lucas Black is terrific as the fish-out-of-water hero. Brian Tee makes a first-class villain as TK, while Sung Kang is appropriately laid-back and cool as a glacier. Superior stunts, adrenalin-laced races, and a sympathetic protagonist make this ‘Fast and Furious’ installment a breath of fresh air.",zardoz-13,2014-02-17,2014

1.0,Worse than the worst movie ever,"We just saw this movie in Kansas City and to say that it was a huge disappointment does not begin to tell how bad it was. The race sequences were okay, but there is absolutely no point to the dialog or plot. This movie is unbelievably demeaning to women, starting with the blonde babe at the beginning who offers herself as the prize to the winner of the race between the Lucas Black character and the ex-kid from Home Improvement, and continuing with the Janet Jackson look-a-like who has nothing to offer but coy smiles and short skirts (not that there's anything wrong with that). What's worse is the fact that Lucas Black is cast as a 17 year old, when he looks like he's already in his thirties, and the Yakuza uncle character who looks like he's doing a very weak imitation of Don Fanucci from Godfather II. We were hoping for a little summer entertainment, a la Transporter 2, but what we got instead was too little action and too much posing. Whoever wrote the screenplay for this piece of garbage should be blacklisted from Hollywood. In fact, to say that this was worse than the worst movie ever gives it too much credit. It is the worst movie imaginable.",Santenza,2006-06-16,2006
7.0,"Action packed testosterone, cars and chicks. But don't try this at home. :)","I expected no less and no more than what I got: Vin Diesel, fully using his newly acquired love for Shakespearian acting, gives us a performance of style and finesse. Too bad that's only in the last minute of the movie.In the rest of the movie, hot head teenagers race for no other reason than adrenaline overdose, using top class Japanese cars in Tokyo. The story is pretty weak, too, but if there are people that get turned on by cars, this is a porn movie, and they don't really need a story.For a movie placed in Tokyo there was a suspiciously low number of Japanese actors with actual lines. The cute Asian chicks appeared only in a few scenes, then ""drifted"" away. Lucas Black, with the same accent he has 10 years ago when he played an annoying kid in American Gothic, has now a big pack of extra muscles and a winning smile.Conclusion: fast paced car movie, nothing else, really. A few free Japanese lessons now and then and a very peaceful representation of the Yakuza. And the disclaimer in the end felt so funny when my heart was beating faster against my will from the speed racing and it said ""everything was done in a controlled environment, don't try this... blah blah blah"".",siderite,2006-07-10,2006
7.0,Like finding a pristine Z in the garage with a seized engine...,"First, I am a car guy. So at least one of those stars is simply from the fact that it's a car movie with good vehicle exposure. That being said, I went into it thinking I'd see a weak attempt at milking the franchise, and was pleasantly surprised to find a plot, character, and development. FF3 has it's warts, but it ain't half bad and I'd recommend it to anyone into the car scene. Now for those warts. First and foremost, the car racing scenes are gratuitous and CGI'd: it's a movie though, people, so get over it. They look cool, even if in some cases, whomever was responsible should be taken out and flogged. The laws of physics *can* be obeyed and still permit the production of a good racing scene. Acting was excellent, which has always impressed me in this franchise where I expect something more along the line of Mischief 3000. So kudos to casting and directing. The plot in this (no spoilers!) is weaker than a head gasket on a 1960 'vette been in a barn rotting for 30+ years. And what makes it worse is it didn't have to be. Hire me, boys, I can fix your flaws! But still not so weak I couldn't watch it. I am not appreciative of the plot vehicles they are using to draw these people together, though. You do not have to bring the movie down by utilizing undersirable character flaws. Seriously, call me, I'll walk you through how to make a better movie without the weak plot. The hunnies are nice, but barely adequate to anyone who's attended a good car show. They need more camera time. The lead actress Nathalie Kelley is fiiiiiiiine. But she got enough time. The cars were the real loss on this one. No time was spent in even cursory discussion about what chassis, what engine, what tweaks. That's why we come, boys, to see the cars. There are some really nice cars, just not a lot of time spent on them. I couldn't even identify a couple they were so modded, and that's a shame. Going to have to buy the DVD with the extras disc to find out more, I suppose. All in all, more fuel for gear heads. And Tokyo looks great; I can't wait to get a look at those hills up close and personal.",icbkr,2006-06-20,2006
7.0,Gotta love the drift!,"Judging by the majority of the comments I'd better explain myself and why I like this movie. Sure the acting isn't that great and the storyline is a little hard to follow and hard to believe but tricked out rides are the stars in the franchise of the Fast and the Furious. The first one had the nation going crazy because it showed everyone the world of street racing. This is why I can appreciate Tokyo Drift because despite the acting and the iffy storyline it introduces another element of street racing, drifting. Before this movie if you mentioned drifting to the average person they wouldn't know what you were talking about. So I like the movie because it concentrates on the racing theme which is why people went to see it. I know it's a movie so there has to be a storyline but sometimes it ""drifts"" away from racing too long...sorry couldn't resist the pun. As for the totally new cast, it didn't bother me because as I've said the cars are the real stars in movies like this, it doesn't matter who drives as we've seen in the previous two films. It gets a 7 for the awesome racing scenes in Tokyo, they keep you interested enough to sit through the blah blah blah that is everything else in the movie.",coolnes20,2006-11-02,2006
1.0,"Horrific excuse for product placement. Neither ""fast"" nor ""Tokyo""","I'm an American who has lived in Japan for most of a decade. I can honestly say that this film, supposedly set in Japan, is entirely untrue to the real Japan. Fashions, culture, economy, language... all are wildly misrepresented or simply ignored. You will feel that this is a ‘version’ of Japan cooked up by a Californian 9-year-old. The film also plays on patently insulting false stereotypes: 1) A black high school junior hoodlum who (impossibly) sells stolen goods openly at school, has a driving license, and drives his own heavily decorated new car; 2) Everyday high school women who are impressed by racing, and will literally offer themselves to the most impressive driver around; 3) A mafia boss who agrees to settle a major dispute with a foreign ‘nobody’ by racing rather than ignoring the moron or shooting him; 4) a dirt-poor ignorant American ‘kid’ who manages to get an expensive car free from a new friend, master racing in a day, ruin and rebuild cars in hours with a budget of nothing, and capture the hearts of every babe he sees; 5) ...and a whole high school of thin model-like kids who have no jobs, don't study, own $100,000 cars, and wreck the cars nightly. The film is an insult to you, the audience. Do you really want to pay a dozen dollars to watch a nonstop car-and-iPod-and-sneaker commercial that ignores the real Japan, insults women and black people, and has not one believable plot element? Vote with your $, and say ‘no’ to this horrific swill.",sethness,2007-10-05,2007
8.0,Really good film.,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is the least popular of the Fast and Furious franchise but it's also the most underrated. While I thought the country accent was a little overblown and some of the cgi looked a little too obvious, the movie was really good. The plot is fresh and exciting, the acting is spot on, and the cars are great. That's honestly one of my only gripes with 2 Fast 2 Furious is that, while really entertaining, it got away from the car element quite a bit. This movie brought back the cool car factor that made the first film so special. Overall, while it wasn't as good as the first two, it was still a great movie in its own right and one that can stand alone without the others.",Bruce722,2013-06-05,2013
6.0,"Target audience stuff - noisy, full of rootless action, devoid of characters and convincing plotting , it sounds and looks like nothing more than an extended music video","When yet another town sees Sean Boswell getting into trouble with the law, his mother sees no choice but to send him out of the US to live with his father in Tokyo, Japan. However it is not long before Sean gets involved in the illegal racing scene yet again. Taking in by Han, Sean immediately clashes with DJ, the son of Yakuza Kamata over the racing and also the latter's girlfriend Neela.Three films into this franchise and nobody is really even pretending that anyone is here for the characters or plotting subtleties. So instead we have a choppy script that expects us to buy the laziest and nonsensical plot devices yet  witness the way that Sean gets in with Han, it makes little sense but the script doesn't let that bother it as it blunders onwards. What it blunders towards is the thinnest of excuses for lots of car chases, load music, male posturing and sexy girls in skimpy clothes. That the plot is poor is a given and it is probably not worth getting into it because I don't think the makers were aiming for more.It is also perhaps unfair to criticise them for this because they hit their targets with ruthless efficiency. Knowing their target audience the makers deliver the goods when it comes to what male teenagers will be looking for and it does it in noisy spades. There are lot of shiny toys and lots of races full of unlikely moves and screeching tyres. Personally I found them repetitive and lacking the tension and involvement that comes with action built on top of strong characters and stories but if all you want is the gloss then I can see why it would appeal. What I found a little less easy to swallow was the film's treatment of women. At best the women are love interests with a bit of history but the majority of skimpily clad and dancing  quick to flock to the male characters and always ready to give out phone numbers. Lesbians kissing in a corridor are thrown into the mix for no reason other than titillating the male viewers. It is nothing new in this type of film but it is tiresome to see it  is this the message we want to send to teenage boys!? The cast are average to a man. Black is pretty poor and I quickly tired of his accent and his character. He rarely manages to hold the attention when sharing the screen with anyone and is thus not a great leading man  even at this level. Bow Wow is at least fun and he benefits from not really taking it too seriously  in the more serious moments he is weak but that is to be expected. Tee is a solid presence in the baddie role but, with more dialogue to undermine him, Kang is not up to much. Kelley is cute but is not given much more to work with. I thought she did the job but not much more than that. Sonny Chiba buys the movie cult points in a cameo. Lin directs like one big pop video but not a very imaginative one since he revels in the obvious touches of flair and lacks imagination in his delivery; good for what the audience wants but is that all he wanted to achieve?Overall then a film that does what you expect of it, which will either be a good or bad thing dependant on your viewpoint. It is noisy, full of rootless action, devoid of characters and convincing plotting and at times sounds and looks like nothing more than an extended music video  which is just what it is I suppose. Knows its target audience really well (depressingly well) but will have little to offer those outside this limited demographic or seeking more.",bob the moo,2007-04-19,2007
6.0,Ummm....OK I guess,"Going into this movie I had the lowest expectations ever. I mean Bow wow is in it. Couldn't they have gotten some better actors like Vin Diesel or Paul Walker, like in the first two? No, they got Bow Wow. Well I went in with very very low expectations and walked thinking it wasn't too bad. It was an o.k. overdone action movie I'll give it that. The acting was quite cheesy and the movie itself was predictable. But at the same time it did have some very nice(nice, not possible) racing scenes that I did enjoy. Another thing was that I totally didn't feel the fast and the furious ""feeling"" throughout this one, as I did during the first two. It just doesn't quite follow the same theme and guidelines. But its a guaranteed favorite for all those die hard action movie lovin people, jus wasn't all that great with me.",maxgunko,2006-06-19,2006
3.0,An abomination of all that is right in this world.,"This is my first movie review. Prior to this, I had no intention nor any reason that would provoke me to respond to a movie by writing a review. I feel that if you are going to spend ten or twenty minutes of your life in front of a computer in order to deliver a message about a movie to random strangers, the movie has either impressed you and you want to extol the sheer brilliance that you have just witnessed, or the movie was so bad that you want to JUST WARN PEOPLE TO STAY AWAY FROM IT! In the case of The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, this is a HUGE WARNING. If you have a moment, take some time to read ahead and explore the crapfest that is The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. Much, if not all, of this movie is crowded with higher tier actors (Vin Diesel at the end is the only exception... and to be honest... he's not even that great of an actor.. he's just good at his static, one dimensional character roles which require minimal talent). Lucas Black (you know..... that guy from Friday Night Lights...) hardly does any real acting. And of course, Bow Wow tops the list of amazing and talented actors that make up this movie (let's not forget other classic Bow Wow movies such as Johnson's Family Vacation...). Clearly, the script was written by a seventh grader. I see no possible way that a living and breathing human being can come up with so much horrible, gut-wrenching, cheesy, mindless dialogue. Some of the lines are also completely irrelevant to the ‘storyline’ of the movie. They make the characters try to sound deep, but instead they created the biggest over indulgent piece of crap ever known to man. Ten minutes into the movie, and you'll notice the problematic script. Yet the dialogue, sad to say, is not the least of its problems. The storyline. Man, wow............................................................ ............................................................... where do I begin? Sean Boswell is a seventeen year old student who loves to race cars. Challenging the rich kid, he completely destroys his car and is just a short step away from juvy. Instead, he gets sent to Tokyo to live with his father. So far, the plot makes sense. Here's where it goes wrong. Sean Boswell gets drawn to the racing world.... Then an hour of complete crap happens, he learns to drift, and he challenges the nephew of the local mob boss to a race, making it clear to his father that ‘he has to fix this’ ----> yea.... I'm just as lost as you are, the dialogue doesn't help either. Then he wins the race (surprise surprise) and instantly becomes the new King of the racing world. Oh and guess what, he also wins the girl! no movie would be complete unless the guy wins the girl. Anyways, there really is no set plot here. A guy looking to stay out of trouble suddenly becomes the hottest thing in underground racing. Not to mention, the mob boss is a pansy. There really is no bad guy in this movie. You'd figure it would take more than a race for some seventeen year old kid to prove himself to THE MOB. Granted this goes down as a partial mob movie, it is probably the most inaccurate and stupid mob movie of all time. Basically this movie comes down to good looking cars, fast paced action, and Asian cleavage. What the film lacks in consistency, dialogue, acting, and everything else that makes a movie great, it tries to make up for in tight Asian skirts and huge breasts. What gives this movie any hope for a great review is the fast paced racing scenes. If there is anything Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift has done right, it's the racing scenes. I must admit, they were pretty entertaining to watch. Yet that still does not make up for the poor acting, horrible script, and senseless/ridiculous plot that is The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. Had the filmmakers polished up some of these areas, this film might have a fighting chance for a good review. However, right now that is not the case. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a horrible abomination of everything that is right in this world. So far it has prompted a loser like me to sit here at one o'clock in the morning and issue this review/warning to avoid this movie at all costs. Period.",MotoXGT789,2006-06-26,2006
8.0,"No rats in buckets, no CGI, just an entertaining flick featuring excellent car racing","Branching away from any original cast members of the first two films, thankfully, Tokyo Drift provides a refreshingly new look to the franchise.Tokyo Drift is possibly my favourite of the series, or at least its up there with the first film; it only has a few problems that can be swept under the ""It's Fast and the Furious, what do you expect"" carpet. The story follows American ""teenager"" Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) whose reckless driving lands him prison time, but to avoid this he moves in with his father in Tokyo. He attempts to move on a dangerous rival's girl, and must become a competitor in the street racing's drifting scene.I say ""teenager"" as that's what IMDb says, and he does go to school in the movie but honestly, he's the oldest teen I've ever seen. Along with every other ""teen"" in this movie! While I talk negatives, the majority of the film is set in Tokyo yet 95% of the dialogue is English and Sean has a knack of meeting every foreigner in the city. I don't mind this so much, but I fully expect all of the Japanese characters to speak Japanese, especially when Sean isn't present!But, unlike 2 Fast 2 Furious (choke) this film actually cares for its characters and their personalities (as Sean says early on: ""It's not about the ride, it's about the rider"") from Sean's fish-out-of- water acceptance, to his mentor Han's closet of skeletons. The villain isn't ridiculous either, his uncle is part of the Yakuza and he has a serious ""king of a little hill"" problem. Again unlike 2 Fast 2 Furious (gag) the cars have never looked better, sleek and refined and the drifting action is spectacular, especially when synchronized. Plus, no CGI, just skilled professional drivers, making the film worth seeing solely for the racing.There's no stupid Tyrese Gibson mugging at the camera, no rats in buckets, no CGI, just an entertaining (albeit poorly localized) flick featuring excellent car racing and professional stunts.",CinemaCocoa,2017-04-13,2017
6.0,More of a comedy than an action movie,"The movie wasn't too bad, at least not as bad as some of the other movies that are still out. I didn't like Bow Wow's character too much. He seemed out of place in Tokyo and I'm not saying that just because he is not Asian. Twinkie, Bow Wow's character, seemed a little too...American for Japan. He had been living there longer than Sean, yet Sean some how managed to learn more Japanese than him. And Sean never did really get the girl. Sure, there were implications that they liked each other, but there's no romance in their relationship at all. My friends didn't really appreciate how Sean, a white man who had just moved to Japan, became the new DK or Drift King. And why was Vin Diesel in it exactly? What I did like about this movie is how funny it was. I'm sure the writers weren't aiming for funny, but my friends and I just found the entire movie hysterical. Like why was it that the whole entire school was into drifting? And there was this one scene where they were racing in a crowded street and everyone just somehow knew they were drifting and formed the shape necessary for the drift to occur. If you want a good laugh, this is the perfect movie from you.",justloseit04,2006-06-30,2006
5.0,"Finally, a Fast & Furious for the weaboos!","The third chapter in the original Fast & Furious trilogy is the last car-centric film in the franchise, this time focusing on the car culture of Tokyo. It succeeds in being a love letter to the city, but changes the formula for the franchise too much in ways that don't work.An attempt at returning to the Teensploitation type tone, Tokyo Drift feels like a stand-alone film but is actually a monkey wrench in the Fast & Furious timeline. Han is easily the best character and is the only one to join the family in other entries in the series. The other characters are straightforward stereotypes without the cheesy charm of past leads like Diesel and Walker..",mediatation,2024-06-17,2024
6.0,Practical,"Summer movies, what a zone to enter! What a collection of thrills, disappointments and adventures of different kinds! Sometimes for me they take me to a sublime place: ""King Kong,"" ""Van Helsing."" Most times its just noise.If its cinematic, I'll credit it with space in my life. Yes, I know the first two F&F were considered dumb, not worthy. Some of that I think is a residual class bias in the US. Muscle cars and racing has always been a trailer park thing. True enough and the stories, all three of them are cluttered with cultural touchstones: dumb, honest, sublegal. And the trailer park notion of girls as prizes.Well, if you are serious about movies, you pretty much ignore the stories. And in summer movies you know the icons transcend their cultural places and move to a grander cinematic place. So a hillbilly isn't a hillbilly, more of a hillbillybillboard. The real appeal is in whether it is cinematic or not. Now this is a tricky issue, and a matter of taste. Tarantino, for example, obnoxiously advertises the cinematic overloading of ""Bill,"" but that's just inventory, right? The Coens seem more genuine and satisfying. But with the Fast and Furious projects, the idea was a nostalgic one, to recall an obsolete cinematic value: the car chase. More, to do it without computer graphics, but with camera angles now common from the CGI era. In movielanguage, this is called doing it ""practically,"" meaning with real cars, mountains, cameras.Computer graphics is still enough artificial that we know the difference. That matrix highway fight or any one of the mission impossible deals might be exciting, but there's an extra edge to knowing that something is real. Like a Buster Keaton or Harold Lloyd stunt. The first F&F simply mined this. I liked it enough to consider my cinematic mind massaged. The second one obviously responded to market research that showed huge ticket sales in Asia. So they retooled the whole thing, both in the story (Asian girls, Asian cars), in the style (neon) and in the film-making itself.A huge hit in Asia. US viewers were almost disposable.Now this third one: actually set in Tokyo though filmed in LA. Its a step down in style: the production design is not nearly as polished and cool, instead it is more industrial, cheaper to do. The F&F production sponsors clearly are settling in for the long haul where they can make one of these every year or so indefinitely. Oddly, the sexy bodies  traditionally the cheapest thing you can get  are played down in this one.Anyway, the real value in this is the camera rush. There's some cool folding at the race at the end where phonecams merge with the cameras we see through. We become the spectators on the side of the road.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",tedg,2006-07-07,2006
7.0,Tokyo Drift.....drifting away from the plot...,"First off, I quite liked this movie. For a movie that followed on the heels of 2Fast this is an achievement. 2Fast was just just lameness personified. Tokyo Drift, or 3Fast, as I will refer to it, was much more restrained. Sure, it had foolish plots, love story, fast, scalextric like cars and all, but it was less....stupid. At least, for 90% of the movie. There are two things that really stand out as a ‘spit-your-coke-into-the-hair-of-the-guy-sitting-in-front’ moments.’ Firstly, and right from the start, we are expected to believe that the lead character is 17 years old. This is the same trick that was pulled in Biker Boyz and it doesn't work here either. Granted, the age difference wasn't as great here, but the guy is actually 24, not 17, and looks nearer 30. Not good for suspension of disbelief. Secondly, towards the end, having peed-off the local crime boss, the ‘hero’ boldly goes into the lion's den to make amends and settle honour.......by suggesting a car race with the loser leaving town! I'm not sure if it was intentional or not, but Sonny Chiba really did look completely non-plussed at the suggestion. You knew it had to happen...it's a car racing movie, after all, but it was just ridiculous. A car race to the death, or the loser having finger's cut-off.....maybe. But not leaving town! Beyond lameness. There are bright spots, though. The racing is pretty entertaining, and they've done away with the ‘hyperspace’ graphics when someone presses the nitrous button. There are a few scenes where the ‘hero’, whilst learning to drift, thwacks a wall and the car doesn't show the damage in the next scene, but does at the end, but that is just down to bad editing. You'd think it'd be easy enough these days to CGI a few dents in for effect. Also good was Sung Kang, as Han (not as in Han Solo, though he has some of the same qualities) who is by far the most likable of all the characters in the film, with his life-zen outlook and easy manner. He steals most scenes he's in, without really even trying. And there is the obligatory cameo at the end from a certain former Fast and Furious star. Not sure whether this was to give the film some kind of ‘legitimacy’ in the franchise, or to hint at his involvement in the inevitable next movie. Either way, an interesting little scene right at the end. Overall then, better than the second movie by far, but still not up to the first one. But worth a watch, nonetheless.",Rob_Taylor,2006-06-28,2006
7.0,Tokyo Drift,"Now let me state I haven't seen it in a long time so I'm going by memory of how I felt about this film.The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift is the third film in the series and unlike the first two films it doesn't have the original cast members which is a let down since it's normally wise to have the cast reprise their roles for the films.But for the story for this film it just makes you understand why they went to a new cast.The plot centers around an American Teenager Sean Boswell (Played by Lucas Black) who gets into trouble with the law after a street race with an high school kid so to avoid going to jail he is forced to move in with his father Major Boswell (Played by Brian Goodman) in Tokyo, Japan.But old habits are not easy to bring as he begins to rival with Takashi (Played by Brain Tee) who serves as the film main Antagonist, the feud begins when Lucas begins to chase his girlfriend Neela (Played by Nathalie Kelley).What most fans would be disappointed about the film is that the film features no of the original characters. But the film plot is interesting but still feels kind of let down considering. Plus we first see Han in the seriesThe action scenes and taunts are good for the film despite it flaw acting but it just a hard film to not talk about. The film is just hold back for many reasons but if you're a fan of the series give it a watch.I give The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift an 7 out of 10",Terryfan,2015-04-03,2015

While Tokyo Drift may sound like 'just another movie about cars', it is much different from the previous two Fast and Furious installments, shifting from the hot streets of Californa to Tokyo, Japan. The protagonist is no longer surfer-boy Paul Walker, but Lucas Black as 17-year-old Sean who always escapes his problems by moving away.But Sean decides to stay in Tokyo this time to deal after gets entangled in a dirty Yakuza mess when he races against a Yakuza boss's nephew, and steals his girlfriend (unforgivably annoying Nathalie Kelley). The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) thus sees American Sean and his crude ways juxtaposed with the sleek technology of Tokyo. It is an effective contrast, and the Tokyo background provides visual stimuli throughout the film, elevating it above generic formula.But ultimately, this is ALL that is good about this film because the acting is atrocious - not any of the leads should ever be allowed to act again, even with better writing. The exception and stand-out performance in Tokyo Drift is the sexy Sung Kang as the guy who takes Sean in when he comes to Tokyo, and teaches him in the ways of 'drifting'. However, I have always seen the Fast and Furious franchise as an elaborate excuse to parade fast cars and fast women, and Tokyo Drift is no different here.5/10",Flagrant-Baronessa,2006-08-08,2006
8.0,Refreshing and innovating,"""The Fast And The Furious"" series opened the cinema for a whole new way to make car movies. This 3rd movie from this series added the cherry on the top of a sweet cake. Lots of action during the whole movie and, I must say, a very good argument. Way better than the 2nd movie with some characters very well created and also their evolution through out the movie.Although, sometimes, it seams that the story walks a bit too fast and things happen too early, this 3rd movie has one of the best arguments of the 3. And I'm still undecided if it is better or not than the 1st movie.Some really good change in this 3rd movie was the feature of drifts instead of pure racing (shown so far in the previous series). THAT is the main innovation in this series as long as in cars movies. The creators of ""The Fast and The Furious"" were PROBABLY pioneers in making underground car movies and they were surely the first doing a movie about drifting.I must say that Tokyo was indeed a very good place to film this kind of driving.Just to finish, I just wanna say there's a great surprise at the end of the movie!!! ;)",pauloshdias,2006-10-29,2006
7.0,A Nutshell Review: The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,"The Fast and the Furious franchise relies on the simpleness of 2 factors to attract an audience from boys to men - sexy cars and fast babelicious chicks, topped up with plenty of testosterone and adrenaline in overdrive. Racing cars of all makes, be they the European, American or Asian models, one thing's for sure, the stunt driving team deserves all the credit. The first movie made a huge star out of Vin Diesel, while the rest had relatively smaller shots at glory, from Paul Walker, who returned for the second, to babes like Eva Mendes, Michelle Rodriguez and Devon Aoki. The third installment decided to insert refreshing elements, and set itself in the land of the rising sun. Presumably influenced by the driving technique called drifting, which made it to mainstream consciousness via the Japanese manga Initial D, it's just too bad that the Hong Kong movie by Andrew Lau and Alan Mak, adapted from the manga, got to it first, like almost a year ago. Perhaps if the latest shenanigans of racers from both sides of the Causeway were widely publicized, this film could even be made closer to home! (In case you're wondering, the Malaysian police had recently conducted a dragnet rounding up illegal racers on its North South Highway. Flashy cars with raunchy stakes - the winner gets to take home the loser's chick for a night's worth of lurve) There will be no doubts, comparisons between the East's Initial D, and this one from the West. In my opinion, this one edged out Initial D. There are many aspects in which Tokyo Drift is superior, and naturally having a bigger budget means that the filmmakers can afford to put more cars on showcase, more cars involved in races, and more races in varied locations like a tight car park, on the streets of Tokyo, and as a homage too to the source, they couldn't miss the mountain range. Scenes were for both day and night, unlike Initial D's predominantly night scenes. It's never about the acting, though Tokyo Drift will lose out in terms of having relative rookies helm the show throughout, unlike Initial D's stellar supporting cast of Chapman To, Anthony Wong, to established popular teeny-boppers like Edison Chen and Shawn Yue. But Tokyo Drift did have veterans like Sonny Chiba lend a hand, and the coup was the casting of Keiichi Tsuchiya, the original inspiration for the manga, in a cameo. Taking over the lead role from Paul Walker and Vin Diesel is relative newcomer Lucas Black as Sean Boswell, a good for nothing troublemaker with the inborn need to speed. He comes from a broken home, and is the root cause of his and his mom's moving from city to city, because he cannot get out of trouble from the law. When the final straw broke the camel's back, he gets sent reluctantly to live with his father in Tokyo. Thinking that the Asian city has nothing to offer, before you can say ‘drift’, he finds himself drawn into the world of underground racing, with plenty of flashy cars, hot chicks and mean Yakuza-linked punks itching to challenge anyone to a race. As clichés rule over this movie, Sean falls for the Drift King's (Brian Tee) main squeeze Neela (Nathalie Kelly, thought she looked like a cross between Paula Abdul and Rosario Dawson), while unwittingly got brought under the wings of Han (Sung Kang), business partner of Drift King, who teaches him the true meaning and purpose of drifting (which is a no-brainer purpose of snagging hot chicks). Anyway, to a gaijin, Sean is ignorance personified, from culture to racing, he takes these challenges head on, stupidly. And surprise! A movie like this offered some one-dimensional character development of troublemaker turned good, who learns the meaning of brotherhood, although fame did get into the way of course. But herein lies another strength against Initial D, the lead did not turn out to be ‘all powerful’ - here he has to learn the basics of drifting in an incredible short period of time, and turn out well of course, at the expense of expensive tyres, and cars (always a pain to see them being wrecked). Any racer worth his salt must pimp his ride or zhng his car, and this one offered no less. The star attraction in the franchise are the vehicles. From the Nissans to the Mustangs, it seemed that the Mitsubishi Evo will be a mainstay, and the hero always drives one. It's almost a no- brainer to film movies like these, having stunt drivers to do the actual stunt driving, then cut to actors looking as if they're driving, and insert multiple cuts of hands on steering, foot on pedal, looking mean, etc. Instead of just incessantly focusing on drifting, there are the standard zig-zagging car chases, and some usage of Nitro for that quick boost of horsepower, which the first two movies frequently used. Given its ending by an uncredited cameo which will send fanboys of this franchise into highs, this movie still has potential to be relatively popular and the franchise can indeed continue. It wouldn't be far out if there's an announcement of The Fast and the Furious: North-South Highway, and yes, you heard it here first! So race away, and unabashedly indulge in this movie that makes no apologies for being fast and furious to the loud sounds of its contemporary soundtrack!",DICK STEEL,2006-07-28,2006
1.0,I just left the movie with blood springing from my forehead,"I went to watch this movie with a friend who's really into tuning and cars all in all. I haven't seen the two previous movies, but since this really had nothing to do with the others I persuaded myself to see this...and, well my friend didn't get anyone else. I knew what I was about to see. Fast cars, nice chicks and some throwaway male-lead. Little did I know... I hadn't read the reviews since I really didn't care about this movie. But I guess it was supposed to be a good popcorn-flick. My friend is broad in the shoulders so I was uncomfortable in the seats throughout the movie. Having to lean left the complete movie I was a bit cranky after wards. But I had my popcorn and Pepsi. So I was happy for about ten minutes. Ten I started paying attention to the actual movie. My god did I make a mistake. I should have bought a boatload of popcorn and have a heart-attack instead of concentrating. Lucas Black has the...he has no skills. He's f***ing terrible.(I don't know if I can curse in here.) He looks dull, he smiles horribly, he speaks like he's had a brain surgery gone bad and I have no idea why he was shown shirtless for the 15 seconds he was shirtless. Jesus H Christ, is this guy Turkish? A couple of times I laughed out loud since his acting was so bad. He was so terrifying that it wasn't even funny. And the price chick? I have no idea why I disliked her but still I did. Guess I had high hopes of a pretty Japanese girl in lead. Now, I'd like to tear the script piece by piece since the characters where so unlikeable and the plot so...pointless is the word...but I won't. I'd like to see Erich from ruthlessreviews.com do that. They're so much smarter than me. But I have to give the climax some credit. The whole deal dumb and pointless(again). I wish they had fought for the girl instead of driving(no spoiler, it's predictable). Seeing Lucas Black shot after winning(of course he wins, is there a possibility he won't?) the race would have been more than satisfying. Possibly after that brought back to life and taken to that place in the movie Hostel. So guys and girls. Don't see this movie. Instead, choose Genius Babies 2, Crossroads, Gigli or painful death. Something with heart. So after we left the scene of crime my friend asked me what were my first thoughts. I said I wanted to kill him. Ps: With the budget they had, they could've had someone else instead of Mr Black. With lesser, still they could've. Why the hell did they choose Mr Black?!!!!???",Killbourne,2006-07-13,2006
10.0,I watch this film at least 4 times every year,Not a huge fast and the furious fan but this is a whole other entity genuinely 15 years old now and still holds up the nostalgia is something else reminds you of great times - plus has one of the most iconic sound tracks of any film I've sent every song is spot on I just absolutely love this film and I hate cars,cameronmcclure,2021-02-01,2021
7.0,Pleasant time pass entertainment,Rating6/10Pleasant inoffensive entertainment makes for enjoyable time pass. More oriented towards the younger lot with stylish cars lovingly photographed and an old fashioned storyline. A huge improvement over the previous film.,wildlife-ptech,2019-10-12,2019
1.0,What?!??!?!,"Whoever voted for this so highly needs to be educated. The plot was absolutely horrible. How is a race going to settle the conflict? How did a busy Tokyo street completely clear up because he honked his horn. How did he learn to be the best at drifting in a few days when he was no where near a good racer as is. The whole crowd was outraged and laughing at the idiocy of the writers at this part, among many others. There was no depth to any of the characters. We barely saw any nice cars, although the drifting was nice. The whole movie was not tied together at all. I don't want to spoil anything so I'll just leave it at this. Don't pay to see this movie. You will feel gipped.",krenar1,2006-06-26,2006
7.0,Deeper and darker,"Justin Lin's film is deeper and darker than the first two episodes of the saga. With actions followed by consequences and a sense of responsibility to be developed in order to be able to turn mistakes into learning opportunities, the plot is enriched with a deeper pedagogical meaning. Last but not least, the violent and shocking death of one of the film's characters, as well as the warning message at the beginning of the end credits, concerning the professional qualities and the strict safety standards necessary to make the film, remind us that driving in the public space must never be a mindless act disrespectful of the highway code, which protects our health and our life.",OMTR,2023-05-11,2023
6.0,Overhyped,"Watched this like 18 years after its launch and was overhyped to the point of making it a religion. I am a weeb, so I understood some of the words like gaijin (meaning tourist or outsider). After watching it I also realized that DK had no traits that make him a compelling villain, the main character's gf (Beth?) just said ‘Oh we went to Touge to watch kids drift until we got out rides and started drifting together’ and ‘DK used to be so nice and kind before, until he started to assimilate himself into the yakuza world’. Which is such a lame ass backstory for someone who became the MAIN ANTAGONIST! He was given the worst treatment a character ever gotten, he only existed to be a villain, not a man who became the villain.",thinezequieltan,2024-02-17,2024
7.0,watch it again in 2024 !,"Watched tokyo drift for the second time after 18 yrs
yup i enjoyed it ..even more
i ithink its one of the best of the fast and furious series .. FF 1 , FF 2 and tokyo drift the other in the series just too many gimmickIn tokyo drift they have:
no CGI
normal car with a good modification....
normal person as a driver not a secret agent man or super soldier...
no such thing as a ""family""
more believable story than the other in the series , no car vs tanks, no car vs submarine , no car going to outerspace just car vs car
so please make FF series like this ..about race + nice car and speed.................",tio-01602,2024-06-04,2024

Worst dialog ever :P Worst casting to by the way, Lucas Black gotta be one of the worst actors I've seen in a long time, what was with the accent, bad smile and stupid grin ? Every time he said something deep was just hilarious, that guy cant act for sure. Even the scenes with drifting got boring, cause its the same and same all over again, from start to end.

10.0,Adrenaline Rush - Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift is a solid good third entry action flick!,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) in my opinion I think is a solid good action sequel, a very bashed and hated in the series. Which I don't think this movie is bad, I think is a much better movie than Furious 7. I always loved this movie, I think it is a good movie, but in the series is not the worst one, but is far from worst one that would be Furious 7. I think it was a different solid, good sequel in the series and I love it for an action film. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a fun movie to watch: it accomplishes what it set out to do and that's provide the most realistic yet gravity-defying racing sequences, backed with the eye-catching background of the electrifying, neon Tokyo. Plot-wise it suffers a bit and the acting isn't top-notch, otherwise the loud music, import cars, cityscape Tokyo, and Japanese pop culture more than make up for the flaws of the film that you'll watch it again and again.Plot: When convicted street racer Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) tries to start a new life on the other side of the world, his obsession with racing sets him on a collision course with the Japanese underworld. To survive, he will have to master drifting—a new style of racing where tricked-out cars slide through hairpin turns, defying gravity and death for the ultimate road rush.This movie is more the highest-octane installment of the hit movie franchise built for speed! There are more mind-blowing stunts and heart-pounding racing sequences than ever, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift will put you in the driver's seat. ""Strap yourself in for a blistering, super-charged ride.""-- Pete Hammond, Maxim"" The CGI I am sorry but in one way it is terrible which I really did not like when Sean (Lucas Black) and Neela (Nathalie Kelley) are slide down with the car during the car chase and they cross over the crowd of people without hitting anyone, you can see the camera, that it is made with a CGI that is the only main problem I have with the film, the rest was okay. This is a very simple film, not a big confusing plot and again this films, you know 5,6 and 7 the plots are still pretty simplistic.5 was a heist movie, 6 was this guy the evil version of you, we want him to bring him down simple.7 you killed this guy's brother, he is looking for revenge and he also try's to kill you so you get this, simple movie not complicate at all. That is one thing that this movies get right constantly.The racing in this movie: I think they did a better job than in 2, because I didn't noticed more of a CGI, because that's how they just do it now, a lot of wide shot you can tell there was a lot of practical stunt drive, it look good which I enjoyed that. I know a lot of people will put this movie lover down and I think it is a solid movie and a solid flick. This is the first time Brian Tyler made the score and this is also the first one that Justin Lin directed, he went later directing three next movies 4,5 and 6 which I love to death. I thought the direction is good, I like the resolves on the end of the movie, the sound track is good, I did not mind the cast you know. Lucas Black is the lead in this movie. Sonny Chiba is in this movie I always like the actor. This was Sung Kang's first introduction of his character Han who later appeared in 4 as a cameo, than in 5 and 6 as regular cast. Vin Diesel did returned with his character Dominic Toretto, who made a cameo scene on the end of the movie, which I thought was pretty cool. Bow Wow I didn't mind him in this movie and Nathalie Kelley was extremely hot and I really though she was much better sexy babe, than Eva Mendes was in 2 Fast 2 Furious. Nathalie Kelley lights up the screen as Neela and I would welcome her return to the series any time.Overall: Tokyo Drift gets a solid 8 by me it does lacks on the great characters and the cast of the first two movies in the series, but is redeemed by Han, awesome car scenes and a pounding score from Brian Tyler. I have enjoyed this movie and I think it is a solid action movie, I love this film and it is a step above than 2 Fast 2 Furious by me.The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a 2006 American action film directed by Justin Lin, produced by Neal H. Moritz and written by Chris Morgan. It takes place between the events of sixth and seventh films.

7.0,An interesting Fast Movie,"This movie is great and I think it's slept on. Every car enthusiast should love and enjoy to is movie. It's about JDM's in Tokyo and drifting, what's not to like about it? Lost people didn't like it and as a result, we're experiencing the PTSD of Fast 9 and X. This movie dared to be different and it worked. If they made another one similar to this focusing more on the Japanese car culture, it could've been a WIN. But no, we have to deal with the Fast X and I'd rather watch Transformers honestly. This is a great movie compared to most of the Fast movies. Vin diesel killed the Fast franchise. The series are becoming more like the expendables movies. If they think Fast 9 and x are great, then unplug me from this reality.",stevetelfer,2023-08-04,2023
2.0,"I'd rather eat my own head, than see this again","Well, not literally, really. I went to my friend's birthday, and this film was showing in town, i with four other friends(who happen to enjoy films like this) decided to go to this flick. The closer we got to the theater, the more i couldn't shake the feeling, that i am doing something so wrong, so satanic and amoral, that burning the bible would seem like saying a prayer at dinner.But i just couldn't leave out, as this was the birthday boy's idea and he paid for the tickets. I must also note, that to of those friends had already seen the film about three times or so.Now, to talk about the movie itself. It's bad. It's so frigging' bad. Why is it so bad? Oh, well, let's start with the acting. Our leading man, Mr. Lucas Black gives one of the most dreadful performances in years, to say the very f*****g least. This movie guarantees him a career of mindless and dull action crap, for sure. Or maybe that's what he wants? Heck, if i knew. Nathalie Kelley tries to be the mysterious hot chick, but fails miserably at what she tries to reach. The only man who saves the acting, possibly the whole movie, is Sung Kang. His character, Han, is so slick, so cool, that you can even believe an actor this good signed on for a movie this bad. Saying this movie is pointless is putting it mildly.As i said before, two of my friends had seen the movie before and knew all the lines to it by heart, if they even have one. So they were saying the lines of the actors before the actors themselves could say them. I couldn't believe there are people so tasteless in this world. After this tale of unbearable horror ended, my friends loved and decided to go for a second watch. So, i had to go too. After this experience, i simply wanted to kill and tear apart, not only my friends, but everybody else who liked this movie. Yet, i still gave this movie a 2. Why? Because of Sung Kang. He earned this movie the 2.As i mentioned, my friend paid for the movie, so no money of mine was wasted, and that's the best thing that happened through this awful experience.Do not see this film.2/10",kidboi,2006-08-24,2006
8.0,Not a bad film considering it was a Part 3,"Usually when a film has a Part III, it leaves you with, ""Why did they make a third film?"" Case in point, ""Smokey & The Bandit"". Now I am dating myself if that's the only film I can come up with when it comes to trilogies. But car movies are seldomly done in trilogies. Star Wars, The Godfather, Lord of the Rings and Back to the Future are the only exceptions that have worked in the past because there's an on-going story line.Tokyo Drift was a good film. Good plot line (if you disagree, then you're a ""Too much to think"" film-goer, stay with chick-flicks then). Good action. And of course, cool cars. The fact that it strayed away from Part I & II was a good idea. And film director, Justin Lin did an great job getting his vision to film. The mounted camera on a super-fast go-cart gave some spectacular shots.It's a good escape film with the ""new kid in town, gets beat up or loses in some sort of competition, learns from a local to be better then wins in the end."" But for a trilogy film it's excellent compared to other Part III films that have been released.",andrew-limtiaco,2006-11-02,2006
7.0,A fun car flick,"I feel like what the first two films relied on too much was CGI to make the races feel more vibrant. But there is a surprising lack of CGI here and that lack of CGI makes it feel a lot more real. As far as the races themselves go, I think the opening race (which these early Fast & Furious films had quite frequently, for those who don't know) is probably my favorite in the franchise, at least that I've seen. I'm not a super big fan of the main character (I'm terrible with names), I feel like he was not cast right and I think he was a very badly written character. In fact I'm not really fond of these characters in general. I felt like they were quite forgettable and, well, bland.If you're in the mood for a fun car flick and insane stunts, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is the film for you.",Z21708,2021-01-10,2021
1.0,May have spoilers but who cares this movie blows.,"Coming into the theater I had no hope for this movie. The first 2 were horrible and I was dragged to see this one. There are two ways to portray this movie, 1: as a joke, or 2: ""awesome"". People who do not understand what makes a ""good"" movie will love this film. First off, acting yes, was horrible from the beginning and especially to the end. Second problem, the ""culture"" of the Japanese. Nobody in Japan cares about drifting, except for those fisherman of course, and not every teenage girl is a skank in a short skirt looking for ""awesome"" drifters. The plot was ridiculous, completely predictable. Hmm, love story with an outsider, dad gets involved with drifting, and o yeah someone dies. When Lucas Black's Japanese friend crashes his car, why did the car blow up? Was he carrying C-4 with him? The drifting scenes looked like they came right out of Need For Speed Underground, but without the point total on top. If you see this movie, at least get someone else to pay for you or just do not go at all. For the people that liked/loved this movie, they need to watch what a real movie is such as Fight Club, Reservoir Dogs, V for Vendetta, or Pulp Fiction.",Lgmsbroncs07,2006-06-21,2006

7.0,It's All Drifting,"OK Now I'm on Tokyo Drift .... Let's see, What I like about TD is the introduction of H A N Z. I love him in this installment with his fine self. I love his calm cool demeanor and those eyes. Yes those eyes ... He came in and played himself it's not like he took on the role of any of the other characters but then again I guess that may have been part of being allowed to use the franchise name and continue to push out installments. Just in case the originals ever got on the same page and in agreement to all come back and do another installment. But this installment I like because of the ""drifting"". It was a fresh and new at the time and I thought it was some of the better drifting I'd ever seen had me wishing I could do that and wanting to move to Tokyo ....I'm such a big kid, I know LOL. I don't think Bow Wow brought anything to the line up or the franchise. He was like a Luda type character.

1.0,"Horrible movie,","Possible spoiler warningThis movie was horrible as I kind of predicted it would be. The lack of reasonable plot and plot holes spoiled it.As a Navy brat that lived in Japan when I was a kid, I for a fact know that Navy kids do not attend Japanese schools, they attend American schools. Navy officers do not live in shacks in Tokyo, they live on the base, because they get big houses for 25% of the price. In Tokyo drift they do neither of these things. I'm almost 100% sure that the Yakuza have no interest whatsoever in drifting. They'd prefer to be making money. I'm also sure that not every drift car in Japan is sponsored and covered with stickers. As a person who is/was pasionate about the sport of drifting, the way this movie portrayed it was a joke. Basically this was another attempt by Hollywood to grab onto pop culture and warp it to their ends to make money.

4.0,Who green lighted this?,"What an incredible tour De force of crap. Of course I didn't care for the first two movies in this series. However I do like cars and racing. Why not just make a good documentary about street racing? Having lived in Japan for 3 years the idiosyncrasies are over whelming. For one Tokyo has some of the heaviest traffic 24/7 in the world. Maybe they could drive like that at 3:AM for a few blocks, but not how they show it in the film. I will say the cars were great and so was the driving. The girls were hot too. Sorry but the story was disappointing at best. His little hip-hop sidekick was annoying 5 seconds after he showed up on screen. The acting was total garbage as well. If both of those kids were military brats, why didn't they go to the American school on base? Do you know how hard it is to learn Japanese at 17 or 18 years old, and do well enough to keep up in school? Give me a break! This is a great looking movie, but fare from good entertainment. The story line is weak as water and the characters are paper-thin.",djray65,2007-04-21,2007
8.0,Much better than the others.,"Got a free screening pass to see it 6-12, saw it with some car buddies, the dork I am took notes.This movie had more semblance of a plot than the rest of the franchise, the action stayed fresh and actually flowed with the plot, and the characters actually had motivation this time! There weren't any HUGE glaring inaccuracies (other than daddy throwing sonny the keys to a car with NO ENGINE in it...) The three cameos in the film were well placed, though a bit campy at the very end. The cars and action sequences were amazingly choreographed, one even leaving my whole theatre clapping for the protagonist.I give 8/10 because of low expectations, and being totally blown away when it was much better than I expected.",la-fashionista,2006-06-13,2006
6.0,Different from the rest.,"""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" veers off the established path of its predecessors by transporting us to Tokyo, introducing a fresh narrative centered around the art of drifting rather than traditional racing. This third installment distinguishes itself with a heavier emphasis on visual storytelling, capturing the neon-lit streets and the unique underground drift culture. Although it departs from the familiar faces and racing styles of the first two films, ""Tokyo Drift"" offers a compelling exploration of growth and redemption, wrapped in a visually stunning package that pays homage to a distinct automotive discipline. Its deviation from the series' formula marks it as a standout chapter, enriching the franchise with its unique perspective.",schmittfalte,2024-02-25,2024
1.0,Utterly worthless waste of time and money,"TFATF is THE most pointless and artistically redundant franchise in history! The first, which was a total piece of crap, gave way to a tepid, moronic sequel and now, after three years of peace and quiet we are punished with Tokyo Drift. The most American Japan you will ever see in a film! Although there is even less of a story than the other two (if that's possible) it is still a carbon copy of its predecessors and offers absolutely nothing new. The characters are crap! The action is lame, soulless, overcut and PG13-friendly and is obviously 'inspired' by hours and hours of endless Playstation.The only reason I went to see this turkey is because I LOVE Japanese girls. But, like I said, this is the most American Japan you will ever see, so there is hardly any of them at all. And all Japanese girls are shot from behind so you can't actually see that they're Japanese. Whether or not this is because they are just LA girls masquerading as Japanese Girls or it's because Universal didn't want to alienate American audiences I don't know. But if you're expecting anything remotely resembling a culture clash then ditch that preconception. I guess that kind of thing would be too difficult for the writers of this trash to muster. And how the hell does hillbilly main character Sean Boswell master the Japanese language in a few days? It's no secret that TFATF films operate on a declining scale. And, forgive me for sounding like a fuddy-duddy, I feel that they send the wrong message to the wrong generation.Speed gets you babes. Speed gets you babes. Speed gets you babes. Speed gets you babes. Speed gets you babes. Speed gets you babes. Speed gets you babes. Speed gets you babes.The film is even less subtle than the above paragraph. Despite the disclaimer at the end, warning naive audience members of the dangers of such driving (such people cannot read anyway and left as soon as the screen went black) I must point out that too many impressionable kids forget this is just a stupid fantasy movie. A dumb disclaimer at the end isn't enough to dissuade them from trying all the crap that is featured in this movie.But that is to be expected from lowest-possible-common-denominator garbage.",CuriosityKilledShawn,2006-06-21,2006
7.0,Not that bad!! Underrated!,"While the film didn't have as much action as the other ones and while I wish Vin Diesel wasn't just shoehorned in at the end, I still had a fun time with the plot and confrontation/rivalry between the protagonist and antagonist. It was also cool how it was eventually made to be tied in with other films in the franchise. The main character had a pretty decent origin and while it is far fetched that he would be sent to Japan after he committed a big crime in the U. S., I thought it was a good and unique spin on things. The chases and races were really well directed and choreographed too! People are too harsh with rating this one!",SPZMaxinema,2023-06-19,2023
7.0,True to the Title!!!,"This movie was Fast. This movie was Furious. And all in an okay way. Being a major fan of the franchise, I was eager to see how the third would turn out. Knowing someone in the movie biz, who worked on the movie, Neal H. Moritz (His credits being the producer of the first Fast & Furious Movies, Vin Diesel's xXx, xXx State of the Union, SWAT, and more) I got to be the first of many to go to the World Premiere. The movie was entertaining, not the greatest storyline, but this movie had the most intense and exhilarating car chases, probably ever put on the big screen. Lucas Black, the lead in this movie, playing the cool, car maniac, did a good job to fill the shoes Paul and Vin left behind. If you are a fan of the first two, I do suggest this movie to you. And even if you're not a fan, but you are into the Drift world of Car racing, this is your movie. In my opinion, The FAST & FURIOUS movies, are some of my top favorite movies of all time. So I must say that even with a somewhat weak storyline, this movie did earn the title FAST & THE FURIOUS.",wizmrs,2006-06-04,2006
7.0,Better then I had expected.,"First of all, I loved The Fast and The Furious. It had an interesting undercover cop story with a little illegal street racing flavor to it. Of course Vin Diesel's character Dominic Toretto stole the show and as soon as I found out 2 Fast 2 Furious had Paul Walker starring and no sign of Vin Diesel I knew it would suck big time, and it did. I hated 2F2F because of how they dumbed down the story into something I could write within a matter of hours. My little brother got the DVD so I checked out the deleted scenes and what do ya know! they had cut out some scenes which would have made it a bad movie instead of the piece of crap it turned out to be.As soon as I heard Dominic Toretto would make a cameo appearance I wanted to see Tokyo Drift. Yes I wanted to watch a full feature film just for the 20 seconds we got to see Dominic Toretto. But aside from the bad actors like Bow Wow (why not just use another rapper while we're at it) the story came back to the franchise! I went to see this movie with expectations lower then those for a Steven Segall movie but I was wrong! Dead wrong because a lot of things The Fast and The Furious had were back with a Japanese twist to it! Once again the main character starts out as an incompetent driver and eventually turns out to be one of the elite. Also, once again there's a girl involved! And once again there's some actual killing going on. Not that that made it a better movie but 2F2F did feel like they wanted to keep the rating as low as possible. If you liked The Fast and The Furious then your going to like this as well. No it's definitely NOT better but at least now they could close the trilogy without a big flop like 2F2F.",kevin-tufo,2006-08-10,2006
4.0,Terrible,"This movie was truly difficult to watch, and many parts we just skipped through as we cringed through some of the scenes and dialogue.It's hard to take seriously this movie about teenagers racing when the main ""teenage"" character looks like he is in his 30's and still attending school. Many of the other ""kids"" also looked way too old for their roles.The plot and story-line are weak, characters shallow and unsuited to their roles. This movie did not feel part of the franchise, and looks to be some bad idea turned into a bad movie. The current IMDB 6.1 rating is generous, in my opinion.I found the movie frustrating and couldn't wait until we had skipped through to the end.",bluesquirrel2004,2023-03-02,2023

7.0,"Great car racing, okay everything else","The car racing in Tokyo drift is fairly realistic, definitely exciting, and takes up more time in the movie than it's predecessors. Which is refreshing, seeing as the basis of the movie is racing cars. The plot is a little thin, in that there really isn't one for the majority of the movie. The last few minutes it pulls something together to end the movie. Acting is a little subpar, the main character is a bit dry, but it doesn't detract too much. Don't go in expecting an Oscar worthy performance and you'll be pleasantly surprised by the quality of action.",Calicodreamin,2019-08-10,2019
5.0,"An honest, real review","I'm gonna be Real Honest here.
Love fast and furious movies,they're fun to watch, so was watching them all again, and can't help myself now but have to comment on this movie because it is sooooooooooooooo annoying thinking about the fact someone, or more than one person, actually got paid for the casting in this movie!?Nothing personal against Lucas Black, not saying he's a bad actor, but what kind of mentally challenged guy or team of people thought he was the right fit to play a 17yo troubled teen in this movie????I mean seriously?? Whoever payed anyone to do the casting for this movie, call me next time in stead to cast ur movie and I will do a million times better for free...Picking a 35year old looking guy to play a 17yo kid (with a terrible southern accent)... It blows my mind... Again, not judging Lucas Black, if someone would pay me a lot of money to play a 15yo girl in a movie once, fk it, I will do it too.But I'm a 34yo man, I am not right to play that part! I'm writing this review in the middle of watching the movie, and going to finish watching it now.But will still be so annoyed the whole movie long watching some 35yo looking dude struggling to act like a 17yo kid...Really worst casting ever, they might as well had anthony hopkins play the main charachter, would've been just as believable.",davidplees,2019-09-16,2019
8.0,The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,"When I am watching the Fast and Furious movies I am not looking for a mind bending plot, I am looking to be entertained. That is exactly what this movie did. I really liked the how they kept the street racing aspect, but put a spin on it. The drifting was really cool, and the final race was arguably the best ending to any Fast and Furious movie at the time (It definitely wasn't after the later films came out). They probably should have brought back the original crew in this movie instead of waiting till the fourth installment, but just like 2 Fast 2 Furious, it ended up working out. I also really liked how this movie takes place after Fast and Furious 4, 5, and 6. I am so happy they did that and if you watched this movie, you know why.Don't listen to the critics, this was a good movie if you can get past the shaky plot, and decent acting, I recommend this for you. The movie did make up for that with great directing from Justin Lin who came back for Fast 4, 5, and 6, and some very likable characters like Han (Who is the only person besides a cameo from Sean in Furious 7 to come back). All in all, this was a pretty entertaining movie.",kaden_lewis,2021-07-03,2021
7.0,"Not bad, better than the last.","This film was definitely not as bad as the second. OK, they've all been fairly rubbish, but in a good ‘enjoy them with a few friends and a few beers’ kind of way! It was a good way to distract yourself for a few hours, and I could think of worse ways to spend £6. The plot was slightly better (although still fairly crap) than before, and the actors weren't too bad. The cars and race scenes were up to their usual standard and looked pretty slick - I think the reason this one's about drifting is so they could tie-in the fantastic number of gear changes used throughout the series. The addition of several hundred hot Asian woman wearing very little could only be described as the icing on top! The appearance of Vin Diesel made the film for me, it was uber-cheesy and had me in stitches.",ilikeyoghurt,2006-06-29,2006
1.0,Very Insulting,"I wonder is there anyone here actually from Japan and were they also insulted by this movie? Not even being Japanese, I found these movie greatly insulting to the Japanese culture. I have never been in Tokyo, but in my university I have met many international students, including some from Japan. And the girls that I've met were very polite and educated, interested in classical music and literature. In art, history and politics. And then some American director makes a movie showing showing Japanese high school girls in barely any clothes and high heels, but what is even worse is that they are pictured as completely brain dead. Their only pursuit in life is to look better than the other girls in order to get a boyfriend who is the fastest drifter. In the movie they don't even speak. But of course, they don't have any thoughts or ideas, they just need to show off their legs, right? It is just as insulting to Japanese male teenagers. Their only interests of course consist of fast cars and girls. There is no existence of science, art, music, sports. The world consists of metal containers with rubber wheels that use gas in order to move. And that is the greatest love and passion of all humans. It's also funny that those teenagers in the movie are in high school and yet spend most of their time discussing cars, looking at cars, racing cars, buying cars, anything else that has to do with.... cars. Funny because one of my Japanese friends also had a comment about that and he said that in the final grades of high school, as he was going into science, he had to take Biology, Advanced Physics and Calculus with multiple variables. He, very unfortunately, did not have the time for drifting and in fact did not even have time for a car at all. A very sad reality it was.",unknown-flying_object,2009-04-30,2009
6.0,All that NOS just eats your brain cells away... but who cares?!,"Intense would be the perfect one-word summary for this movie, similar to the original Fast and the Furious.The funny thing is however, the plot just seems to keep getting worse with each sequel that the F&F series pops out.In this one, Sean is your typical teenage truant who gets into loads of crap for all his street racing antics. He's sent to Japan to live with his soldier dad and there he's assimilated in the Japanese underground world of... DRIFTING! If you plan on seeing this film, prepare to leave your brain at the door because the plot here is almost non-existent and instead prepare to be hammered with an excessive amount of EYE CANDY.Hot babes, hot cars, a hot city and hot lead characters will fill your eyes while Sung Kang (Better Luck Tomorrow) delivers a terrific performance that adds some much-needed humanity and drama that has been lacking with its predecessor.Still not as good as its first older brother, but definitely better than its 2nd bro. Go see it, summer's finally taken off!!",Joventino,2006-06-16,2006
7.0,Entertaining,"‘The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift’ (2006) is a very entertaining addition (the 3rd film so far) to the ‘Fast and the Furious’ films. While most sequels tend to be inferior to the originals, I found this one very refreshing and unique. Expertly directed by Justin Lin, this movie is definitely style over substance, but a great style it is! When you see the cars ‘drift’, you are in for a ride (pardon the pun!). So while the story and script are unoriginal, and the acting by Lucas Black as the lead character Sean Boswell not up to par, it's still a must-see - at 7 out of 10.",russem31,2006-10-04,2006
6.0,"For some sick reason, I actually liked The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift","I just saw the first two Fast and the Furious films a couple days ago and I had this gigantic fear of watching Tokoy Drift, I wasn't into the first two films, and this seemed like another guaranteed let down. But since I rented all the films simultaneously, I just wanted to get my money's worth, so I watched The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift this evening, I have to say that I was totally surprised. Even though it was typical and the plot was predictable, I still liked this film a lot better. I feel like this was the story that they should have started out with, it seemed a little more realistic. Well, most of it anyways, not to mention the killer ending they had, but I won't spoil. But The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift has a great story and an unbelievably good looking cast, you can't help but love it.Sean has just raced the toughest jock in high school and well, you guessed it, they got hurt doing so. Since the jock has a good connection Sean is in trouble for it, his mom doesn't know what to do with him, so she does what any sensible parent would do, she sends him to another country! Japan, to be with his navy father, but he quickly discovers the under ground world of ""drifting"", which is actually racing, but it sounds a lot cooler, doesn't it? But he gets involved with the good guy who vs. the bad guys who belong to a Japanese mafia, and falls for the bad guy's girlfriend and they race each other, you know how the story always goes.The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is typical and silly, but for some reason, I really did enjoy it. I think it just had a better story. Either that, or I figure maybe I was just in a better mood when I watched this film opposed to the other two films. But I did enjoy The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift and would recommend it for mindless entertainment, after all, this has cars and good looking people, what young person could ask for more? Well, I'm sure there are many different things I could ask for, but I got my hour and a half's worth.6/10",Smells_Like_Cheese,2007-12-04,2007
1.0,Awful movie.,"Everyone is entitled to their opinions and according to mine, this movie was awful. I'm a big fan of Fast & The Furious 1 & 2 but this movie disappointed me. 1. Lucas Black didn't show any ‘personality’ what so ever. His character is completely boring and irritating. 2. This movie is more about people's personal issues than racing. 3. The plot of this movie is such that it seems it was only set to attract an audience comprising mostly of 15 year olds. It looks like an attempt to get people to try drifting. I shall conclude my comment with a little advice for the young boys, that is, if you actually manage to win a race like the one in the movie, your prize money will be your hospital fees. Even if you do manage to walk away without a scratch, just know that racing won't help you find the love of your life.",xquisite_dynasty,2006-07-29,2006
10.0,"Enjoyable, much better than first two","I just came home from the drive in, i was looking forward to this movie since i have read some good reviews about it and also that I'm a car freak. A lot of people have been bashing this movie without even seeing it and bashing the idea of putting a RB26DETT Motor into a Mustang, i agree its not right, but it is just a movie and if you can get past that then you will enjoy it...anyone who loves the sound of a tuned skyline will love it. Keiichi Tsuchiya makes an appearance in this movie and so does Sonny Chiba, but i wont spoil the other cameo. Justin Lin does a good job, the movie itself has great action scenes, awesome drifting and car choreography/stunts, the cars look and sound awesome, there are a couple of one liners that make me laugh (‘Can i have a copy of that?’) you will know what this means when you see it and the babes....the babes are just gorgeous. Overall its a fun and enjoyable movie, far better than the first two. Car lovers will like the movie but for everyone else....don't bash it till you've seen it, you might be pleasantly surprised.",bekimdine,2006-06-15,2006
7.0,This franchise drifts back into fun,"After an entertaining first movie and nearly unwatchable second, Tokyo Drift brings this franchise back into the positive with an absolutely refreshingly fun and unique twist on the formula. Set almost entirely in Japan, which is notorious for winding mountain roads perfect for drifting (as seen in Initial-D, which is recommended if you liked this, both the movie and the anime), this movie brings back the cars and action sorely underutilized in the second movie and spices things up with a bit of Japanese culture and swanky mid-race camera tricks.Tokyo Drift won't be winning any awards for acting; the acting here is cheesy and oftentimes teeters on bad, particularly when it comes to Neela (played by Nathalie Kelley, who switches accents from scene to scene and seems to think she's in a Disney channel show). But that's not why we're here, is it? I didn't expect a masterpiece of acting when I watched this so I won't knock the movie for it. What I will say was disappointing was the focus on American characters in Japan (for what it's worth, I am American myself). Initially, I didn't know the main character of Tokyo Drift was an American, though as the movie played out I accepted it since it's genuinely entertaining to watch an Alabama boy try to assimilate into Japanese culture. But quite a few main characters weren't Japanese, including Neela and Twinkie. For being set in Japan, I was hoping for more Japanese characters. Han was awesome and quickly rose to be my favorite character of the franchise yet. While I won't spoil anything here, the choices made for Han's character disappointed me greatly, though I have to give the film credit for actually *going* there.Overall, I found this the most entertaining film in the Fast and the Furious franchise yet. While I know the films branch out from here, I only wish for more racing/drifting films set in Japan because it's stuff like this I can't get enough of. The climax race of this film (American muscle versus Japanese drift) was an absolute thrill. More like this, please!",fewald139,2019-08-26,2019
1.0,What a load of crap!,"I have absolutely nothing good to say about this complete crapload of a movie. It lacked plot, dialogue, and anything that makes a good movie. The only way you'll find this movie good is if you sleep through it. Please, I beg of you, do NOT waste your money on this load of crap. This movie is basically directed at adolescent boys who have no sense of what on earth makes a good film. Now, that's not to say that ALL adolescent boys are like that; but if they are, they'll love this. You want to know what this is about? Here's the whole story: Kid gets into trouble a lot. Kid moves to Japan. Oh look! It's 200 barely dressed women! Oh look, an explosion! Hey, let's race! Oh look, an explosion! Oh dear, someone died. Hey, 200 barely dressed women! The End. Explosions and hot girls make up this supposed ]movie.’ Every five minutes I was forced to watch another stupid freaking race. NOTE TO THE PRODUCERS: IT GETS OLD AFTER THE 900TH TIME THEY RACE.

9.0,The best F&F movie of all time !,"By far, the best car movie i've ever watch in my entire life ! This movie takes place in Japan and shows lots of cars especially from Japan such as the Nissan 350Z, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IX, Mazda RX-8, and many more Japan cars. This movie not only talks about Japan cars, but also talks about the Japan life such as the Tokyo's underground street racing, Japan night life, the school life in Japan, and Yakuza. Different from other fast and furious movie which shows about a heist movie with pretty cars, Tokyo Drift is made for car enthusiasts. What I like about this movie is how Japan people spends lot of time and money for their cars and do races with the cars they build. This Japan cars is mostly known as JDM cars which lots of car enthusiasts love them. The races the do in this movie is very intense and interesting to watch. In conclusion, this movie is made for car enthusiasts from all around the world who love cars very much, especially JDM cars. I highly recommend this movie because I love cars so much ! From 1 out of 10, I would rate this movie a 9/10 !",matthewjovian,2021-03-16,2021
7.0,Solid,"I have seen the other reviews of this film that are negative and I just don't understand. This is no high concept, high-brow. This is girls, cars and loud soundtrack. What did you think it was going to be? Some great racing scenes. This could have easily just been another racing for cash film, but it actually was smart in pulling in the drift scene. Same cars, but different style of racing.Overall I thought the characters were fun. Again, nothing high concept here. Just enough info for you to separate the good guys and bad guys. Throw in a little romance and there you have the formula that made the other two films in this franchise hits.",RCWjr,2006-06-18,2006
1.0,Disappointing to say the least.,"For being an American movie on a Japanese concept, I first expected it to be a mess. But after checking out the movie website I saw that they did some homework, so I had moderate-low expectations going in. And with those expectations, I was rather disappointed. It was no Shuto Kousoku Trial and I'm well surprised that Keiichi Tsuchiya dared have anything to do with it.For starters the dialogue was terrible generic canned phrases all through the movie, but that was to be expected of a mainstream Hollywood production. Most notably would have to be the camera work which is the choppiest work I've ever seen done. In an attempt to make scenes more dramatic and appear faster than they were, the fast camera movement only wound up leaving the viewer with mere pieces of what was going on, rather than conveying an actual scene; it wasn't styled either, it was just bad. Even for being obviously low budget (canned dialogue, little scenery, etc.) the plot was clearly quite formulaic and the main character simply embarrassing to watch. I don't even want to start on the hair-thin plot and unnecessary sexualization. Maybe I've just grown out of that junk.There were, however, two or three good (yet painfully brief) scenes that just had a good feeling to the way they were done (like they kept the camera still for more than a second and combined elements like plot and environment). Also, the character Han is fantastic in his Japanese manner of doing things, but his character is ruined by two significant events, the first of which is something he does that is unfortunately way out of character. That's what brings this movie up to a 3/10 rating for me.",soulshinobi,2006-06-17,2006

6.0,indulgent popcorn fluff,"Rev head Sean has been in trouble with the law for awhile. Hitting his third strike when racing through a construction site, he's shipped over to Japan to live with his father. Instantly on the wrong side of everything, it's not long before he's back into the racing world, introduced to a different style of racing; drifting, using the tightly constructed car parks for races. To full of himself, Sean takes on DK; Drift King, using DK's business partner Han's car. Losing the race and smashing Han's car, Sean becomes in debt to him to pay for the car.The whole of the Fast and the Furious franchise is all about the spectacle. Glossy, fast paced action, great cars, hot women, an abundance of over indulgence. The spectacle is what made the franchise so interesting and so popular. Slapping together a story line to serve the action and badly written dialog are easily over looked, only to the extent that you deliver some amazing action sequences. Director Justin Lin has on account delivered some amazing action scenes. The energy and adrenaline run hard and fast, with tyres screeching at ear piercing levels. This does run off set pieces; the chase through Tokoy city is one great example, leaving you just waiting for the next piece to arrive, though the down side is you have to sit through terrible acting and plot ridden story.When your characters are so broadly drawn and one dimensional, you don't give your actor much to go on; yet they aren't that talented in the first place. Verging on Grease levels of older actors playing teenagers, Lucas Black doesn't have much strength to carry this as the lead Sean, walking around with a stunned mullet. Sonny Chiba comes off cartoonish as a Yakuza boss. Brian Tee lacks menace as DK. Sung Kang does the best performance as Han, not taking his role to any real serious level.If you start to think about all its inconsistencies or take this serious for even a second, it hurts your mind. It's a piece of entertaining popcorn fluff.",nobbytatoes,2006-06-25,2006
6.0,It's actually alright,"American teen Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) gets into serious trouble street racing. He is set to go to jail, but then he is sent off to live with his military dad over in Tokyo. His dad's rules are to go to school and don't drive. Almost immediately, he breaks the second rule, makes an enemy of D.K., and gets in debt to Han (Sung Kang).Lucas Black is a good solid actor. It makes up for the fact that most of the film had none of the original cast. Sung Kang who would go on to play Han in other F&F movies is very effective. The same cannot be said for Bow Wow or Nathalie Kelley. It's mostly Bow Wow who sticks out like a sore thumb, and it has nothing to do with him being black. The cars are pretty like always in the franchise. The drift driving is interesting for about a minute. The chases have been done better. There is a bit too much CGI in the chases. The one thing that is great about this movie is the Japanese locations. It's nice to see the franchise really go to Tokyo.",SnoopyStyle,2014-03-30,2014
5.0,An Average By The Numbers Action Movie,"24 October 2006. This movie did what it was designed to do - show of fast cars and a little bit of female legs for the young men going to see this movie and make a little profit for the producers. This predictable movie without much more provided the typical thrills and melodrama that any tame male macho movie is supposed to, except for its more exotic locale - Tokyo - which is used to a degree. While the plot is mostly straight forward and the action decent, there isn't much else, except for a small attempt at avoiding a fight scene and a weak attempt to introduce Japanese culture to the American movie scene or vice versa. The chase scene that includes lots of drifting unfortunately was handled in the most obviously set up way with cars set up in patterned, artificial ways so that safety came first (while essential) really made the movie look cheap. The character development of course was flat, the relationships nothing special, the integration of Japanese culture only mild - not much new or learned here. Just a fast-paced, not even that sexy, a movie that at least held together decently. Five out of Ten Stars.",tabuno,2019-01-22,2019
6.0,I didn't get it.,"I was so excited to see the next F&F....that being said, the first 75% of Tokyo Drift had some moments, but for the most part, I was bored with it. I could never buy into some of the characters (ie the main girl, I forget her name) which made it hard to take in the movie as a whole. The story line was there, but it just didn't do it for me.The ending was pretty cool. From the final race to the ending with the cool Dodge (and who was in it). A sequel without any of the regulars doesn't make sense.This should've been a movie by itself, not of the Fast & Furious kingdom. Maybe I would've liked it a little better....maybe not.I gave a 6 of 10 just because it had the hot girls and hot cars, otherwise, it underwhelmed me.",NoMoreFreaks,2013-12-31,2013
2.0,Truly shocking to watch,"As an expat living in Japan, I had resisted watching Tokyo drift as long as possible due to the overwhelmingly bad reputation the movie has. Despite which, I can say with sheer confidence that the last 17 years have done nothing to improve this film. The plot is both non existent and extremely pandering to some sort of American feverdream about what Japan is (spoiler, Japan is nothing like this). It only takes a few minutes of scrolling through the IMDB page to realise that none of the main actors are Japanese and the majority of the filming was done in LA. Threadbare plot and complete lack of cultural understanding aside, nothing is as unforgivable as the main actor who can barely read his English language lines off the page, not to mention Japanese -- though to be fair, no one seems to be able to speak Japanese in this film (Was there even a language coach onsite?). Long story short, if you want to see an adult man masquerading as a teenager in essentially a rehash of the worst tropes of the other F&F films, you're in the right place. Shoutout to all the other incredible reviewers down here in the 1-3 star range, I experienced a wider range of emotions reading these reviews than watching the entirety of the movie.",megandbeale,2023-02-01,2023
8.0,Much better than the other 2,Where do i start with this film? When i first heard this film wasn't going to have any of the original cast in it i felt rather disappointed but my opinion has totally changed after seeing it for the first time.The cast in it are great.Lucas plays his part well as does bow wow and the guy who plays Han. The things that stood out for me were the racing scenes mainly.There are a lot more than there were in the other 2 films and in my own opinion the races in this third are a lot better than any in the first two. The story isn't half bad either.I actually prefer this one to the 2nd film because of that as well as the racing. This is definitely a must see for all fans of the other two films though.,bopper-5,2006-06-27,2006
7.0,High-octane direction makes it entertaining,"Shawn is a young delinquent with a habit of getting in trouble due to his driving habits. His latest offense has him going to Tokyo to avoid jail time. It isn't long before he meets up with the car culture there and gets an embarrassing taste of drift racing by losing to a local champ who also has connections with the Yakuza. Soon Shawn is drawn into the underground world and a predictable, but stylish summer-fare ensues.The story here is one you've either seen before or will comfortably predict. Also, when going to see a second sequel to a franchise that is all about cars, what can you really expect? Nothing too spectacular on either story or action side of the film, but this is a surprising strong entry to a series, seeing that it is number 3 of course.The acting is decent with the clichés not being to overplayed or outrunning themselves, but rather just acting as connective tissue for the film's main event - the breakneck racing scenes. Which is exactly what the first film didn't quite reach and what the horrible second film in this franchise seriously lacked. The racing scenes here are possibly the best in the F&F franchise with a high octane direction that makes them very exciting to watch. They incorporate a lot of interesting shots - both CGI and real-life - mix it in with slow motion and all sorts of pans, which is then topped of with some frenetic editing and a hard rockin' soundtrack. That makes for some good fast- paced summer fun. 7/10Rated PG-13: violence, frenetic action, and some profanity",BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,2006-06-22,2006
4.0,The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006),"Directed by Justin Lin. Starring Lucas Black, Sung Kang, Brian Tee, Nathalie Kelley, Shad ""Lil' Bow Wow"" Moss, Brian Goodman, Sonny Chiba, Leonardo Nam, Zachery Ty Bryan, Nikki Griffin, Lynda Boyd. (PG-13)After getting busted for racing Tim ""The Tool Man"" Taylor's kid, American teen Black is shipped off to Tokyo to live with his Naval officer father (Goodman); there he attracts the attention of a girl (Kelley) who looks like she came from Japanese High School Musical, and her flat-nosed boyfriend (Tee), whose uncle (Chiba) has powerful Yakuza ties. Third outing has little connection to the rest of the series--at least, until a little retconning was done--but offers much of the same thing one has come to expect from the franchise: sleek autos, bare mid-riffs, incessant soundtrack cues, instructions to turn off the brain, etc. Lame, barely-existent plot spends way too much time away from revving engines; of the cast, only Kang's zen calm style is worth positive notice. The drifting scenes are sometimes engaging, except when mediocre CGI and aggressive editing spoil the fun (good luck figuring out what the heck happens during the last minute or so of the climactic chase). Even though it was and still is the least successful ""The Fast and the Furious"" movie--and nearly killed the then-flimsy franchise--director Lin proved the best fit yet, and was brought back for the next three entries. (Not much of) a surprise cameo pops up at the end for those who stick around that long.37/100",fntstcplnt,2020-02-10,2020
6.0,"Not award winning material, but decent.","Lets get one thing clear, you are not going to a Fast and Furious movie for the groundbreaking plot and acting, you go for the cars, the racing, and the babes. Tokyo Drift is basically the same if not a little better than the previous two as far as the racing is concerned. There is the street racing that the series is famous for but also the addition of drift racing, which adds a new bit of spice to the flavor. As I mentioned the acting and the plot are so so at best, not something you will be groaning over but not enough to really drag you in and connect you with the characters. However it is my opinion that the plot here is better than in the second movie. Lucas Black from Friday night Lights replaces Paul Walker as the main character here, and Bow Wow is along for the ride as the trusty friend/sidekick. A few cameos from other actors and movies are thrown in as well. From beginning to end this movie does hold your interest with the racing, and for that the weak plot and questionable acting can be forgiven. Cars get wrecked, punches get thrown, loud music is played, and the hero has to do what he thinks is right. Bottom line, if you enjoyed the previous two, or even enjoy car racing movies at all you should get some entertainment value out of this one. Not the best movie to ever grace the silver screen, but I had a good time.",madmax_thegamer,2006-06-19,2006
6.0,Better than F2!,"Without any of the original cast members I wondered how this installment would play out. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it more than '2 Fast 2 Furious'.The premise and the characters were much better than it's predecessor. This standalone sequel had lots more action than F2, and the action sequences are stunning! I cared more about the characters, and thought the actors did them justice with good acting. With the lack of comic relief that was just too much in F2, this was more serious and therefore more suspenseful.The events leading to the finale was well set-up as it built to a climax. By that time we knew the characters, and there's been great character development - especially from the lead, Sean (played by Lucas Black). Off course the stunning cars are back - more impressive than F2, and the film has a great rocking soundtrack for most part. The stunts are jaw-dropping.The finale was a thrilling, fast-paced visual spectacle. The film has a highly effective score - especially during the finale. Everything about this film was better than F2. Wow, this was incredible. I loved it! This is a darn good action film!",paulclaassen,2020-07-24,2020
6.0,Not Bad Not Great,Overall rating 6.4: The third film is definitely the black sheep of the franchise. I don't mind Sean in this movie but I would've liked to see Paul Walker in this film. I liked Vin Diesels cameo in the film and I think it was a nice touch. The film isn't as exciting as the previous two instalments and I think that Takashi is a pretty mediocre villain. The film does have some good race scenes but the movie lacks solid characters making for a ok 3rd outing.,twpain,2020-06-07,2020
4.0,"Only worth watching as part of the full ""F&F"" series, and after 6","In 2006, ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" undoubtedly deserved to be panned by critics. The series had fallen so far off the course that only its ugliest, most formulaic bits stayed alive. It's only as part of the franchise that was revived three years later and has gone on to become a billion-dollar enterprise that ""Tokyo Drift"" reclaims some sense of its dignity.Let's get the good out of the way. ""Tokyo Drift"" was a vital proving ground for director Justin Lin, who would go on to make the next three ""Fast & Furious"" movies. His work on this entry was too good for the material, frankly. His shot variety and the editing team give the film a legitimate action feel that the first two films don't even come close to touching. As much as the film overloads on race sequences, Lin nails them.As for why screenwriter Chris Morgan got the long-term gig for this franchise after his work on this film, consider me stumped. The story of Alabama teenager Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) shipping off to Tokyo, discovering the drift racing scene and burrowing his way into the innermost circle is ambitiously preposterous.Obviously the plot of the ""Fast & Furious"" movies is known to be second fiddle to a handful of other components, but this particular plot has some problems as far as race – and unfortunately not the car kind of race, but the people kind. In a nutshell, the story of ""Tokyo Drift"" is misunderstood troubled white teenager flees the consequences of his actions to Tokyo where his dad lives, defies his father's wishes, asserts himself into a racing gang, stands up to the cocky Japanese ""Drift King"" (Brian Tee), tries to steal the man's girlfriend (Nathalie Kelley), earns the trust of his partner (Sung Kang) and ultimately aims to prove he's better than him. Only one of the five major characters in this movie is actually Japanese, and it's the bad guy. The movie is very interested in appropriating Japanese culture and aesthetics for its mostly non- Japanese cast. For starters you have Black, who looks like he's in his thirties and is playing a teenager. Boswell is also written to have the same personality and temperament as Paul Walker's O'Conner, so he's essentially a stand-in/replacement. As for Boswell's first friend, he's of course played by a black rap star (Shad Moss a.k.a. ""Bow Wow"") and the girl he's after? She's an ethnic Australian. Tee's D.K. is painted as the bully, so he doesn't stand as much of an exception. Only Kang's character Han has dimension beyond stereotype, but Kang is a Korean-American actor. The producers' foresight to bring the Han character into future ""Fast & Furious"" films and paint ""Tokyo Drift"" as taking place after the sixth movie was surprisingly astute. When viewed after the next three films instead of before, Han becomes more than just the most interesting character in the movie, but the character we're most interested in given his character arc in those other films. It also makes the movie's surprising cameo at the end make a lot of sense. All this to say, ""Tokyo Drift"" might be garbage as a standalone movie, but given what the franchise has become, Morgan used future movies to position what once seemed like an accident/stop-gap film into being a spin-off. In other words, if you're going to put yourself through ""Tokyo Drift,"" do it after watching the fourth, fifth and sixth ""Fast & Furious"" movies. Lin's style does give ""Tokyo Drift"" some additional value, but for most people it won't be enough to watch it under any other circumstance but as part of the series.~Steven CThanks for reading!

8.0,i dunno wt film u watched,"okay so most people are expecting another version of the original two. well its not, its a whole new kinda racin. so don't go in expecting to see straight roads. and yeah the film takes a while to get going, but its all info that u need to understand the film.Tokyo drift, still has the cars the all the thrills that the other two had,but in a slightly different way. so don't set your mind on the ova 2, and spoil it 4 yourselves.i say its worth while going to see it in the flicks cause u ain't gona get the entire impact of the film on ur own t.v i hav to say that the small surprise at the end is brill! but hey you'll hav to watch it!",spicinamillion,2006-06-26,2006
6.0,The Third Installment Of The Fun Story,"The third sequel to the saga that is fun and ultimately proves to be a solid addition to the entire franchise.Yes, it doesn't have the same amount of fun as the previous two, but it's still good enough and gives us enough action to make it worth watching.The action this time takes place in Japan, and the main character is a teenager who goes to his father to avoid a possible prison sentence. There he gets involved with potentially suspicious characters and that's where the plot begins.We have some good races in the film, bad guys that our hero has to defeat, and a love interest. Everything you need for a fun movie.And the movie, for all its faults, is fun, starting with the great cars, to the hilariously entertaining villains and some good action scenes.Of course, not every film in the franchise will be of the same quality, but at least it meets the minimum criteria, which is to be entertaining and not bore the audience with things that have no place in a film like this.The film certainly deserves its place in the story, and in the end it turned out to be worth watching. Solid entertainment.",dk777,2023-03-20,2023
2.0,Stylized street racer,"Follows a similar theme to the previous two, but character development is marginally better. Babes and cars as fabulous as always, female lead is to die for. Anti-heroes all ridiculously over the top, when we all know REAL hard-core criminals are discreetly deadly. Hero slow to learn and doggedly persistent in his ability to get himself in trouble. Not good but we're into cars right? At least there were no insulting gobbledygook ladled with 'tuner' terms that made no sense like the first one. Racing is as unrealistic as the previous two (when your opponent is catching you, change up. Again.) but some spectacular driving moments could be picked out from the stylized pap, watch out for the drift into a ramp and the top-of-third on-the-limiter full opposite lock moment in the streets. I thought it bad, despite the fantastic Tokyo backdrop and the girls making me want to go jump on a plane from the cinema, but I'll probably put the DVD in my collection next to the other two when it's released. What can I say? I'm into cars :)",rob-mitchell-2,2006-06-14,2006
10.0,Good movie,One of my childhood films. I don't know how many times I watched without getting bored. I think it is a very good movie with its music and catchy scenes. I recommend everyone who is fond of cars to watch it anyway.,geylanimuhammed,2020-06-07,2020
7.0,For Once Take The Movie For What It Is!!!!!!!!!,"DAHMMMMM!!!!! For once would you people take a movie for what it is??? Why does every movie that does well on this site have to be a groundbreaking, heart touching, and life changing experience??? The one word to sum up this movie is ""great"". If you love great looking, suped up cars, hot women (especially hot Asian women) this movie is for you. The action in the movie was basically non-stop. There was always a race or chase or something happening to keep the movie flowing. It was never boring and you always were waiting to see what would happen next.Of course there is some cheesy dialogue and a tiny bit of weak acting here and there but its a great action movie and especially if your into cars.Even my girlfriend who I had to basically drag into the theater enjoyed it a lot.The icing on the cake was Vin Diesel's cameo at the end. It was great to see him back behind the wheel and I hope that maybe he would be interested in doing another fast and furious with him starring in it.Simply for what the movie is, its a great movie. I wish this would have been the sequel to the original because if it was I think the series would still be a strong and popular franchise.So all you people who are giving it bad reviews and low rating need to have there head examined. You all need to stop thinking your Roger Ebert and for once enjoy a movie for what it is!",Real_Film,2006-06-26,2006
1.0,very disappointed,"after i saw this movie tonight, i was very disappointed. frist of all mistakes, pick some koreans to play Japanese-locals roles, i mean come on...this is a Japanese based film, you can do better than that. second, those hot girls look like they're Japanese blended Americans/mild Japanese styled LA girls. third, this movie's camera movements and film editing really makes the previous two better. it has too much camera vibration and rich segmanted sequence may make it look fast, but it also makes you feel dizzy for 1 min of action secquence . fourth, the story is crap, no point at all. if you wanna see LA girls again, wait till its DVD comes out so you can rewind it couple of times, otherwise, no need to waste your money in the theatre for this movie.",blacklude,2006-06-23,2006
7.0,Fast and Furious: Karate Kid,"While the story won't win any awards for originality, the car race choreography and action cinematography is truly amazing, all with mostly practical effects.While Lucas Black does not convince as a teenager, the other actors fare well despite their stereotypical parts, and the setting makes for some spectacular set pieces.A nice change of pace from the others in the series, and a good standalone movie in its own right.",whatgift,2022-03-05,2022
7.0,A worthy conclusion to the trilogy,"I've now finally seen all three FAST AND THE FURIOUS movies. I actually own them all on DVD. I saw TOKYO DRIFT a couple of months ago. I meant to submit a user comment ages ago, but I never got around to it. But now I finally have. TOKYO DRIFT is an excellent movie, featuring the great automotive action and wonderful cars we've come to expect from the series. It took me a while to realise that Lucas Black, who plays our hero Sean Boswell, was the same guy who played young Caleb in the short-lived supernatural show American Gothic. Here, he's all grown up and is very good in his role as the American fish out of water army brat who has to go live with his father in Tokyo after his latest street race in the States lands him in trouble with the law. Rapper Bow Wow is also good as his new best friend Twinkie. Sean's dad is a bit of a stereotypical 'my way or the highway' parent, but helps Sean save his hide in the end. Sean still loves street racing but is new to the culture of 'drifting' in Tokyo. After losing his first race, he is taken under the wing of drift guru Han who helps him greatly. He also falls in love with Neela, who is the girlfriend of the Yakuza connected D.K. (Drift King). KILL BILL's Sonny Chiba is excellent in a cameo as D.K.'s Yakuza uncle and steals the scenes he is in. D.K. himself is a truly hateful villain and you just hope that Sean gives him his comeuppance. Sean eventually learns to be a master drifter and finds another reason to hate D.K. after his mentor Han is wasted after a major car chase. The car action in TOKYO DRIFT is just as good as it was in the first two FATF movies, with some impressive rides on display. The final drift race between D.K. and Sean, with Sean driving a modified Mustang, is a real edge-of-your-seat moment. The acting is generally very good, but I wonder why so many people complained about Lucas Black's accent. The guy can't help the way he talks for God's sake, he happens to be southern. The series is also given proper closure with a cameo from Vin Diesel's Dominic Toretto from the first FATF at the very end. TOKYO DRIFT is a brilliant film. I know it's probably going to be the last in the series, but I hope a fourth film may be in the works, as this film proved when it was released last summer that the FATF franchise is box office gold. Enjoy this one! I certainly did.",bannonanthony,2007-06-08,2007
6.0,The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,"Given the target audience I can understand the decision to cast Asian actors with American accents as Japanese characters, but there is a depressing number of supporting actors and extras that have clearly never been west of Orange County.The hero looks utterly gormless and spends the running time grinning like an idiot and staring wide-eyed in amazement at newfangled alien technology like chopsticks and sandals. Watching him act is like watching a retarded child struggle with his shoelaces - tragic yet cruelly hilarious. His father's in the Navy - we know this because all his clothes have ""NAVY"" written on them - and even though judging by his apartment he's dirt poor he can still afford an endless stream of plane tickets to back up his threats to send the poor retarded boy home. The lead actress is a bizarre-looking, hideously unattractive creature, and one of the strangest choices for a female lead in a teen movie in recent memory. No one in the entire cast has a shred of talent between them.A hotshot racer at home, to make the grade on the streets of Tokyo our hero must first learn to master the ""Tokyo drift"" - an awesome, almost mythical driving technique that turns out to be, um, skidding.It fails completely to make any decent use of a city that is as cinematic and beautiful as they come, it's filled with loud, obnoxious rap and rock music, it doesn't have an original bone in it's body and about the only thing to recommend it is that in the first half at least there is a pleasing number of very attractive young women in very tiny skirts.",I_John_Barrymore_I,2009-04-10,2009
7.0,"Great, for what it's worth!","I got about exactly what I expected from this flick. Not too much on plot, some good driving scenes and a pounding soundtrack.One thing that really took me out of the moment was Lucas Black portraying a ""17-year-old"". He's what -- 26?? Now, having seen him in other things I think he's a fine actor, but even he can't pull that off, what with a full beard (not even clean-shaven!) and chest hair that sticks out of his t-shirt.This movie requires an extraordinary amount of ""suspension of disbelief"", but get past that and you will find an excellent popcorn movie.",implaxible,2006-12-17,2006
1.0,Watched it for the lol,"I could not possibly take this movie serious. I watched all the previous parts and pained my way through it. First there was this slightly to OLD main character Sean from high School. It started of course with a race. But the Price was this blonde Girl. She even set herself out as a Price. I mean common, I didnt´t know this franchise could go any lower in objectifying women. But here they went. The first race was really neckbraking and Sean even drove through a construction building. When the Guy and the Girl crashed - I thought they must be dead. But they only had scratches. At the Police Station, the cop said Sean would go to prison. Which I fullhearted Support! When they said he allready had a full Register with illegal car races and nothing happened to him, it made me so angry... I couldn't like the main character. I am glad the mother kicked him out. Of course, the first Thing you think of to give your son a lesson for live: Send him to Japan for correction. There he lived with his dad who tried to give him some boundarys and threatens him with consequences. Next day he already went to School. Just like that.. in Tokio.. and he doesn't speak one word japanese. The first Thing in class was of course the non-japanese love interesst in the movie. Also he met some African american bloke who oppenly tried to sell him stolen goods. I thought (or wished) it would be a film about integrity, but no - It looked so american I could only guess they filmed it in a japanese area somewhere in a bigger City in the US. I dunno Sean soon discovered he could start racing again in Japan. Although his father would kick him out as promissed. Sean didn't care. And Oh - look, of course his new Girl was the GF from his racing Opponent. And more to come: As he doesn't have a care. Some RANDOM bloke said: here take mine. Although I don't know you and your skills, please, take my expensive racing car. Of course he shattered the car in pieces... and we find out the car owner belongs to yakuza. I have to addmit I drifted of to sleep by myself very often. They had a lot of races in between, but: the never drove like.. straight through the streets. They always drifted. I got it in the parking house... but why would they do that on a straight street? Eventually someone actually died in a race. They Kind of didn't mourn or took a lesson out of it. NO! Sean got in a hassle with some yakuza Boss who surely would just shot him down, but Sean asked for forgivness by driving a race and everything would be forgotten? Stupidest Thing I have ever heard. And they did so! Another race was coming and in the end, the Opponent DK (Donky Kong I thought first) crashed horribly and could have been dead. I hoped for the movie: Sean gets a grip, Ends the race early and Looks after DK if he is alright. No, he doenst. Driving straight to the Yakuza Boss who nods and no lesson was learned that day. It taught the audience, driving riskfull, even getting People killed, is ok. There will be no punishment. Women will like you even more. You also don't have to study or work. You just get new cars. Women offer themselve willingly to even the biggest brats but if you got enough horsepower.",lythis-love,2019-04-18,2019

7.0,"Closer the first one, much better than the second.","There should have been the first movie and then this movie. There shouldn't have been FaF 2, which was not very good at all.Tokyo Drift is decent... so OK they got an actor that's not far off from Paul Walker (or Keanu Reeves), but they've basically completed the import car scene by taking it to where the import cars come from. Japan. Storyline is of course not realistic nor is it feasible where the first of the series, Fast and Furious, held its own. But it's not completely bad like the 2Fast 2Furious, which was successful anyhow because of the cars and actions sequences.The visual effects are beautiful in this film and the action/drifting sequences are second to none when it comes to artful stunt driving sequences. The professionals do a great job with the cars, you get to see popular spots of japan and the art of drifting racing through some crazy stunts, such as when they drift up the spiralling driveway in the parking structure.The characters weren't challenged in this film so, acting was minimal and rhetoric was shallow but it wasn't about the actors and storyline, but about the cars and the action.",phrixion,2006-09-06,2006
2.0,"well, that went well I feel","So, after two crappy movies the film execs whipped out their calculators and did the math 100 hired bimbos + souped up kit cars = $50 and a bag of cheese Thousands of horny teens + flashing lights = £100 million gross. So, a third movie then, only with a twist. This time our erstwhile middle-aged teen hero is off to Japan, where Tokyons drive their car sideways it seems. You can't shake the impression that if they just braked going into the bend and accelerated out of it they would get round them quicker, but oh well. Anyway, on with the plot. The story starts with a race between clapped out banger (driven by the 30 year old teen protagonist) and some meat head given the stupidest ultimatum ever by his bimbo girlfriend ever. ‘Race him for me’ to paraphrase. Rather than give his fickle bird the bird , hoiking her out of the car and driving off into the sunset he acquiesces and so ensues a pointless race around an estate, where much property is destroyed. As our main man begins to overhaul the expensive sports car in his fred flinstone vehicle, the blonde bimbo whines ‘I thought you loved me’. Not for her the more traditional displays of affection, oh no. Her boyfriend does his best to demonstrate his love, smashing her and car face first into a cement pillar. Such criminal violations by all are duly punished by the exile or our hero to Japan where he meets his 40 year old dad (damn gina, he was a real mover in the creche). After this our teen idol is enrolled into a Japanese class. Mercifully, all the Japanese jpop stars and av models speak passable English, but as luck would have it a 50 cent knock off and an ozzie supermodel are also in attendance, bringing great relief to the the focus group no doubt. Surrounded by hot totty in short skirts our main man does what any other teen would do, quickly ignoring them and instead driving his car sideways, at first badly, but after a week or so better than anyone else in Japan, particularly those who have been driving their cars sideways for years. I kind of lost interest after this (as well as the will to live) to be honest. There was a pretty cool party at one point (three guys, 50 hot girls in zero tolerance clothing - arranged by Carlsberg no doubt) but since teenman seemed more interested in going to the basement to look at a crappy bike, my eyes glazed over and my brain disengaged. After a while a Japanese Al Capone makes an appearance and by the time I stopped laughing it was the final race. I won't ruin it for you (if you have a brain cell I don't think it would be possible to anyway) but I would just say that the symbolism of a crappy mustang racing a Japanese car was not lost on me (Go USA eh?) but the middle-aged teens hooting and hollering at their mobile phones was bewildering. Beyond product placement what the hell was that about. To sum up, stupid, garish, unbelievable, pointless, too much stupid sideways car-driving, and not nearly enough hot Japanese teens in minimal clothing. GAh!",DonkeyWan,2009-04-14,2009

6.0,A side story,"This review contains spoilers. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is the third installment in The Fast and the Furious franchise. It is a movie that stars a new cast of characters that engage in drift racing rather than the previous two movies' conventional racing. The movie follows Sean Boswell, played by Lucas Black, that is exiled to Japan following a street race that lands him in jail. Sean shortly after meets Han, played by Sung Kang, who teaches him drifting and the two form a friendship. Surprisingly, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift has a coherent story. This is a welcome change from 2 Fast 2 Furious' incoherent story. The movie follows Sean and the audience can see his journey as he tries to make things right with Han and his own father. The story and the characters are the good parts of this movie as I was engaged to find out more about Han and the drifting culture. The downside is the villains are not intimidating. I did not find them engaging and it felt that it was only a matter of time until they were overcome. The cast of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are not present as main cast members in this movie. This can be a disappointment to fans of the previous two movies as the two actors can be charismatic in their roles. This movie did feel less like the previous movies and more of a side story. The movie felt plausible in its execution of stunts and for this the movie can be enjoyed as a side story set in the same universe as the previous movies. The story keeps up the light-hearted fun of the first two movies but can delve into interesting plot turns. Han is a great character and I enjoyed every scene that he was in. I would recommend The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. Although the movie is not perfect, the movie is a complete stand-alone movie in The Fast and the Furious universe.

1.0,run away fast from this third episode before you get furious about it,"OK i have to admit it : wonderful cars and babes but that's it ...the love story is unreal : to get a phone number from a Japanese chick you just have to do a perfect drift in the middle of the street ??????Above 180kms per hour, don't worry the cops in Tokyo wont arrest you, their cars are not powerful enough ?????Super stunt : the heroine is doing a drift on a hill (better than anything you could do on NFSU) while almost putting some make-up on ????????The only good thing maybe is the appearance of Vince Diesel at the end so you make the connection with the previous Fast and Furious ...Well if you really want to waste your money and have poor clichés about Japanese babes : this movie is for you .... run for it ;-)Next time with that amount of money they could make a documentary which could last 40mn ...",mmulad,2006-06-15,2006
6.0,don't expect too much and you'll have fun.,"don't come in expecting good acting or a believable script. don't even bother following the story. you'll watch this because you want to see shiny cars whizz around and fantastic camera angles. if you do this, you will have a good time. my hands even got clammy at one point because of the action, which is something I can't say for the first. personally, they should have just done away with story lines and just shoehorned in as many race scenes as possible. all the chases and races get a thumbs up from me, but it would have been nice to care a little more about the 'hero'. there really wasn't any of the same character dynamics like the original, even the showdown between the protagonist and villain felt a little forced. you don't really feel like rooting for anyone, but that's okay since it's the cars that carry the movie.",modrngarde,2006-06-15,2006
7.0,Need for speed: Underground,Sean Boswell is an American having passion for car races. Once a time when this passion sends him out 2 jail in-order 2 escape this he goes 2 Tokyo 2 live with his father and study there. But his passion is boosted there by illegal street races. He thinks 2 crank-spot the races but to find Drifts as his disappointment about which he knows nothing. There r neither drags nor sprints but drifts where the driver has 2 curl through very sharp turns retaining his balance with his speed & balance. So Sean tries his luck 2 learn the styles from his rival's friend. He loves his rival's girlfriend which makes the thing worse.Now how he succeeds and gets his love that's the story. The overall movie experience was pretty good. But the plots is not the exact sequel of its former versions.The story also charges as it's all about racing. There is no story in it. the film gets dull sometimes but then it keeps u engaged. But it has not lived up to the mark as its predecessors. The environment is exactly the same as in the game NFS:Underground 2& Most Wanted released by EA Games. If you like the race winds & Japanese chicks then go and take a look at this. Still I'd give it 7 outta 10.,buntyonline,2006-08-21,2006
6.0,cars in the rising sun,"Mark Kermode always warns against seeing films which are based on computer games. Theyare all meant to be awful without any plotting instead relying on brand recognition and glossy producing and a couple of good looking women. Go back and watch Citizen Kane then. This is fun, rookie driver with dark past, we've heard it over and over again for 60 years ""I'm troubled, I let someone down"" so we know where we're starting from. He goes to Japan to take part in a lame macho, genital waving affair of motor racing. The usual dichotomy of good and bad guys who fit clear personality types with no ambiguity as usual. Then the cars do their thing and thats what you've been waiting for. I and some others ended up seeing this as a result of the actress Ashika Gogna and another who had been used as a part of a painting by the actor and scientist Stephen Armourae. Knowing her had an eye for a good thing (or what he likes) I gave this movie a go, it was a pleasant surprise that despite all its clichés it was entertaining and if cars are your thing you sure will be happy. Plenty of handbrake turns and snarling bad guys trying to crash our hero",faheemzaiz,2006-06-29,2006
7.0,"Very Cool ""Drift""","""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" stars Lucas Black and Bow Wow (grown up Lil' Bow Wow). There are no stars in ""Tokyo Drift"". Then again, the true stars are the ""rice burner"" cars racing through the streets and parking garages in Japan. None of the characters from the last ""The Fast and the Furious"" sequel made the trip to Tokyo. So for Director Justin Lin, he has a formulaic story by Chris Morgan populated with attractive heroes and villains, fast cars, and hot women in a very polished package. Here Lin and Morgan use the exotic locale to highlight the underground extreme sports culture of drifting in Japan. Lin and Morgan also provide insight into modern Japanese culture itselfunexpected and provocative. In a stylish signature scene Japanese young people at night stand along the winding downhill road of the climactic race, send and receive video camera images from each other via their cell phones. Brilliant. Director Lin effectively tells his story through captivating imagery.Shawn Boswell (Lucas Black) is a 17 year-old constantly in trouble for racing muscle cars at school. As the movie opens, his latest run in with the law could land him in jail as an adult. Instead his mother negotiates to have Shawn live with his father in Tokyo. His Dad, Major Boswell (a good Brian Goodman) tells Shawn the house rule is ""No racing"". Shawn attends a rigid Japanese school with the mandatory uniform. It is all very high tech, wireless laptops in the classroom. Every kid has an iPod. Shawn hooks up hipster Twinkie (Bow Wow), who introduces him to the nocturnal world of drifting. Shawn would like to hook up with the beautiful Neela (Nathalie Kelly), but she is with DK (Drift King played by Brian Tee). Shawn loses a race in an inept display to DK. However, in the process Shawn gains a mentor and friend in Han (Sung Kang). Han is DK's business partner. DK's uncle Kamata (Sonny Chiba) is Yakuza. DK is someone not to mess with.From the totally ignorant and fascinated perspective, this is a simplistic take on 'drifting'. You have lightweight high torque cars capable of 130 mph with soft tires for turns. In drifting the driver accelerates the turn with the parking brake engaged. It's kind of like self imposed chaos. You are in control when you are totally out of control. Though DK is the Drift King, Han is the Zen master of drifting. Han confides in Shawn ""It's all about trust and character."" Sung Kang has a presence and ease as Han. Han tells Shawn during his training that he is going to have to figure it out for himself by doing, ""There is no 'wax on, wax off'."" Justin Lin captures the adrenaline rush of extreme speed, and the amazing impassion of the drivers. Lin also paints a fascinating picture of this drift culture metaphor. The Japanese kids during the day wear their pressed uniforms, and attend their classes without question. All is ordered and structured. At the drift races, the girls wear their pimped out Britney Spears clothes, and the guys have their spiked out hair and tatts on display. All shiny objects. Fast high tech cars. Hot girls. All rebellion. Here Lin is all style, and it works. There are no real surprises in terms of story in ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"". Relative newcomer Lucas Black is charismatic and believably pulls off Shawn. Nathalie Kelley is gorgeous and charming in the card board cut-out role of Neela. And remember to stick around till the end for a surprise from Lin. ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" will not win awardsit is just very hip and very cool.",jon.h.ochiai,2006-06-25,2006
1.0,A bunch of action with no conceivable plot,"When I rented Tokyo Drift, I already had my standards set low. I already knee from the reviews that the film was not up to par with the previous Fast and Furious films. But, that was counteracted by the comments from my friends who saw the film. one said that it got his brother so pumped up that he was doing burnouts in his Blazer. So, I start the film, which starts in a high school parking lot. This scene had me laughing out loud, although it wasn't meant to be funny. Why it was funny was because the thug was played by no other then Zachery Ty Brian, who we all know as Brad Taylor from Home Improvement. And well, seeing Brad Taylor trying to be a thug is just comedy to me. What I also found funny was that Brian gave a laughably bad performance. I am going to now talk about the characters. The characters all are just unlikable people, and their money and possessions are just implausible. In the first two films, You could respect Paul Walker. He was likable, and you could respect him. In the third film, the lead character is just a dumb, punky teenager who you can never respect no matter what. You will just want to kick him in the face and tell him to shut up. Then there comes his pal, who is a black market dealer, with a brand new tricked out minivan. But he is only a junior in High School, so how could he had come across the cash to get that car? Same with Zachery Brian's character, who drives a Dodge Viper SRT-10. Then to add insult to injury, the actors all gave crappy performances. The only person who gave a respectable performance was Vin Diesel, who made just a cameo. The plot goes like this: Sean Boswell gets in a beef with Clay, played by Zachery Ty Brian. They race, and they both wreck their cars. Sean gets off scot free for some odd reason, but Sean is going to go to jail. So, he leaves for Tokyo. Thats it. Past that, there is no real conceivable plat. There are a couple splotches of plot, like when Han dies and the final race, but besides that, the film is just a bunch of action with no plot. The film shifts gears so radically that it will blow your mind. It can go from Sean practicing drifting to he and that chick drifting around a mountain. After an hour and ten minutes of assorted nonsense, the film ends, leaving you dazed that you managed to sit through the entire thing. it is that bad. To put it in a nutshell, this film is one of the worst films I have seen in a while, and even as a hardcore car enthusiast, I still had a hard time watching this film. THis film is just proof that they should have stopped after the second Fast and Furious film.",priuskillsallsuvs,2007-04-14,2007
9.0,A girl's point of view,"I was fortunate enough to see an advance screening of the film last night. I'm not usually one to seek out action films but this one seemed different. First of all, the setting was intriguing. Secondly, trailer made it out to be a fun summer flick. And guess what? It delivers. I would strongly recommend this movie to be seen in a theater as opposed to DVD for one huge reason: the audience. I can't remember the last time I was in a movie theater laughing, cheering, and gasping with everyone else. That environment is what these movies are made for. I loved the first fifteen minutes of the film. From the creepy pep rally to the metal detectors, the film was able to slip a little social commentary. The first race in the construction site was not only amazing but a great comment on capitalism. Even if the rest of the film doesn't quite live up to the beginning it doesn't matter. The film flows effortlessly and what would have been contrived just feels real. I know these films get all the feminists all up in arms but hey, beautiful girls exist in this world and the way it's shot it never feels exploitive. Enough of the politics. Grab a few friends and try to watch it with a sellout crowd. You won't be disappointed.",allywhoops,2006-06-14,2006
6.0,Good racing sequences get lost in a movie with too much talk and similarities to other films.,"High school kid who gets caught racing one time to many is sent off to Tokyo to live with his father. There he finds himself mixed up in the Japanese underworld and racing once more in the ""drifting"" style.This movie has great car sequences, some good characters, some nice lines of dialog and by all rights it should have worked but the film frequently loses sight of whats going on its own world and so we're left to twiddle our thumbs. After a good set up to the story the action moves to Japan. Our hero's dad lays down the law he's to go to school and not race. After an initial run in about staying out late the film jettisons the notion that anyone is in school or that the kid has a curfew and concentrates on the characters and the romance. This would be fine, except that after 20 minutes of set up there really isn't any sort of racing for about 40 minutes (I know I checked my watch). From that point on the film shoots to its conclusion in a rapid and entertaining fashion. Unfortunately the the damage is done and you're not as fully engaged as you should be. Its not bad, hey I didn't walk out, but its not what it should have been.I have to say that the one thing that really bothered me about the movie is that the film is very similar to the Chinese film Initial D, especially in its climatic race. Actually it seemed like a mobbed up version of Initial D with violence added to the story of racing. Its not fatal, but if they wanted to remake that film why change so much of the story?Worth a look on video or cable. Not worth 10 bucks in theaters.",dbborroughs,2006-06-25,2006
3.0,Cinematic Noise,"The third film of The Fast and the Furious was cinematic noise. It was just engines revving and an obnoxious soundtrack that was used to tie together a flimsy plot and generally unlikable characters. It was a sequel that did not feature any of the previous actors (except for a cameo at the end) and could have easily been a straight-to-DVD film with little connection to the original. It was properly due to the film being shot in Japan that forced it to be a cinematic release. The filmmakers were even able to find a lead that was less charisma and acting ability as Vin Diesel and Paul Walker.The Tokyo nightscape was nice and there was some decent race sequences, but it not enough to redeem Tokyo Drift. It's amazing to think that Justin Lin and Chris Morgan were able to turn The Fast and the Furious into the juggernaut it became.",freemantle_uk,2021-06-17,2021
8.0,It wasn't as bad as I had thought it would be....,"Hey, this movie was actually pretty good!! I'm amazed!!.. I enjoyed the first F&F but it totally got super cheesy in the 2nd... and with all the local teenagers dressing up their $400 cars to be ‘Fast & Furious’, frankly I was just sick of the whole thing… So I saw that Tokyo Drift was coming out, and I laughed and said to the wife, ‘Jeez, They just don't know when to quit do they?’ We got a kick out of it and I put it out of my mind.. A while passed and a few of my buddies were trying to get me to watch the movie with them, I declined and made fun of it, Until one rainy day when I was bored out of my mind and the only thing on PPV was guess what... So I ran down and got a bag of chips, which at the time I thought would be better than the movie, and started watching... Well I have to admit I was quite wrong about this one.. Very well done, they got rid of the police guy in this movie... (Thank God) The cinematography is awesome, a few parts of the movie you might think you're going over... HEY! This movie actually has a storyline! And for those of you Vin Diesel fans, he does make a cameo... Overall I think anyone who originally put down this movie and enjoys racing flicks should watch it...You wont be disappointed.",Ryancoke25,2006-11-11,2006
7.0,Pleasantly surprised!,"Okay, first off. I can understand why the F&F series have such low ratings on IMDb. They're basically are dumb-as-dirt action/racing movies whose only sole reason is for all the cool cars and great racing scenes. Being that I wasn't expecting ""The Godfather"" I had to say I enjoyed both F&F and 2F2F.But I had NO expectations for 'Tokyo Drift'. I thought they can't get Vin Diesel or Paul Walker for #3 and they want to make more money so let's add some mildly-recognizable teen actors and everything should be okay. Basically that's why the film did only half of the second at the BO.Even though my expectations were near the floor, I rented it last weekend and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. First of all, the world and the racing style of the Third movie is way more interesting than either one or two. I enjoyed the cast of characters in this movie more than the second, all for except the female lead.And the racing...WOW! If you ain't a racing buff like I ain't, then you'll probably not have heard about drifting. I would never do it but DAYMN! Does it kick ass! The cars were awesome and the action scenes were incredible, especially the Final Racing scene that pairs the hero and the villain against each other on a mountain course that only can be described as s#!t-inducing (maybe it's not a more but it's the best to describe it) The film had its weak spots here and there and the dialouge could be considered groan-inducing, but if you lower your expectations and just go for the racing then I promise you will not be disappointed. 8/10 p.s.: I also like the surprise apparance of one of the Main characters from the first. I won't say who it is, but you'll like it.",rayato,2006-09-25,2006
1.0,I hated it,"After watching Fast Five and its brilliance, I just realized something: that shouldn't have been a 5th entry instead it should have been 4th. Why? Because this movie was totally unnecessary! I hated it! I think it's a complete defilement of an already brainless popcorn flick franchise. And I really need to lash out at this. Here's why I hated it. First of all the cast. Like I said, this franchise is already brainless but at least the cast of the first two films had a certain amount of weight and depth. I like Vin Diesel because hes a tough guy with the rugged baritone. I like Paul Walker because he's a likable white boy. I like Tyrese Gibson because hes got the gift of gab. I like Michelle Rodriguez because she's tough and sexy. I like Luda because he's got that laid back feel. The cast in this movie sucks. You have the redneck actor who's the main character. You have this slightly hot female lead who I don't know the name. You have some more unnoticeable Asians. You have Brad Taylor from Home Improvement? Ha! Ha! But worst of all you have Lil' Bow Wow?!? The mediocre 5 foot 5 teenage rapper?!? I hate his songs, what makes you think his acting is any better? See I understand that they put Ja Rule in the first film but he had a minor role, in this film Bow Wow plays a main role. It's OK to put rappers in movies but as long as they have screen presence like Luda who I mentioned above. OK lets move on to the plot and characters since you can't have one without the other. The rest of the series has pretty simple enough plots that drive the film. We have undercover cops and we have the criminals, we have investigations and eventually a final standoff. All perfectly believable. This film is what? A teenager that looks 35 is shipped off to Tokyo and then what? Gets into a little entanglement with a Yakuza bosses nephew? And everything magically gets straightened out with a race at the end? What? Are the Yakuza, the most feared gang in Asia, that easily reasoned with? Then comes the setting. Tokyo? Its a crowded metropolis of 30 million plus people where will you find space to race? Please if I want to watch a summer action flick, make sure its in a very picture-esque tropical location. Nothing against the world's most developed city. Then this whole thing of drifting. It was OK as a feature of Need For Speed Underground but not as the basis of a movie which has the word 'Fast' in the title. Although I'm being negative here, I did enjoy the performance of Sun Kang as the shady character of Han. And I wish he didn't have to die, because it really limits the plot lines for the other films. Please rename Fast Five and see if we can brand this as a spin off rather than a sequel.",arnieiam,2011-05-09,2011
6.0,not a good movie at all,"This movie was horrible. The acting was laughable. The story was completely unbelievable. I can't stop watching. I don't know why. First off, I liked the first one even though it was a remake of Point Break. Maybe because I think Vin is cool. So I will say that the best part of the movie is the last five minutes. I think it's a Road Runner that he's driving. Anyway it's beautiful. But......., why are there so many car collisions without any damage to the cars. You shouldn't have to watch closely to see it. Also, ""DK"" keeps walking around with his chin down looking up at everyone giving them the evil eye almost like he's auditioning for a Manson video. Good way to get that big nose broken. Most of all, I'm assuming that both cars in the final race down the mountain have at least similar qualities under the hood. How much more does that mustang weigh than that little rice rocket. Also, DK keeps trying to force him off the road. That mustang would rip through that other car like it was tin foil. One thing this movie does have is enough eye candy to pacify anyone who has the yellow fever. It's actually almost enough to make me move to Japan. In summary, I don't like this movie but I can't stop watching it.",crutch321,2007-05-09,2007
6.0,Surprisingly good!,Surprisingly good! and finally diesel does a sequel!!!! good acting especially by rising star Lucas black. the cars weren't as good in this compared to the past furious movies but that was redeemed through the plot and the stunts. the girls in the movie were hot well done casting crew although you could of chucked in a bit of diversity. i think another sequel would be great this time it could be: - a carry on from this movie - a different kind of race - a different vehicle - or even just a different country. but in the end i liked this one and I'd love to see another one maybe with Lucas black in it again or with someone else with the same talent.,comedyking23,2007-02-03,2007
7.0,"More enjoyable, but still not better than the original, but not the worst.","Following the box-office financial success of 2 Fast 2 Furious, another sequel was already planned for a release in the summer of 2006. So now I move on to the third film, but is chronologically the sixth film in the series as it is the film to take place before Furious 7, ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"".I won't explain the whole plot, but here is a quick summary: A teenager named Sean Boswell becomes a major competitor in the world of drift racing after moving in with his father in Tokyo to avoid a jail sentence in America.The story is a little bit incoherent, but this is ""The Fast and the Furious"", so I will keep this review very short.Needless to say, I love ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"". It has a great story, great action, a good musical score and darn good performances from the cast.The action is really top-notch. The car chases was very intense and much reckless this time around because this had some reckless behavior in this film, so this is why the movies have a PG-13 rating. This film did have a scene where a character named Han-Seoul Oh dies in a car crash, which we see again in the later two films, ""Fast and Furious 6"", which was released in 2013 and ""Furious 7"" in 2015. But in the sixth film, it was revealed that Owen Shaw's brother, Deckard Shaw, killed him and blew up his car. That was just sad and a little scary to see.The car chase at the beginning of the film was a little disturbing to watch because after the two boys race each other over a girl, they are all shown with blood on their faces. Han is also shown with blood on his face, but that doesn't stop me from liking or reviewing this movie.The acting is really great. Lucas Black plays the role of Sean Boswell, the main character, and Black would play the part of Sean Boswell in the seventh film in the film franchise, Furious 7. Bow Wow plays the role of Twinkie and he does an okay performance, but he is also in the seventh film using archival footage.Sung Kang plays the role of Han Seoul-Oh and he would play that role for the next three films in the franchise. He does an incredible job with the dialog written for him.Nathalie Kelley plays the role of Neela, who is Takashi's boyfriend, but has romantic feelings for Lucas Black's character and she does a darn good job in her performance. Brian Tee as Takashi / Drift King just drove me crazy. He is the perfect villain and his performance is very dark and serious. Tee as Takashi / Drift King just really creeped me out when the first scene with him shows.The only character to return from the previous entry, which was the first film, titled The Fast and the Furious, which was released in June of 2001 is Dominic Toretto, played by Vin Diesel as he agreed to make a cameo in the film in exchange for Universal's ownership to the rights to his Chronices of Riddick franchise and character, in lieu of financial payment. The musical score composed by Brian Tyler is just amazing and he would compose music for the fourth film, titled Fast & Furious, the fifth film, titled Fast Five and the seventh installment, which is just titled Furious 7. He blends the musical instruments together in this spectacular musical score.The direction by Justin Lin was bad but I really liked it and the script was written by Christopher Morgan and he really does an incredible job with an amazing dialog and is very cool.Overall, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is as good if not better than the first film, while there are some major flaws, it is still enjoyable and I still think this is watchable. For people who liked the first two and hated this one, watch it again and you will find a darn good story.",joshuadrake-91275,2015-09-23,2015
5.0,Too much of a departure,"This film takes place in a completely different setting and has different characters from the rest of the series, although it is shoehorned into the continuity later. With all due respect to the main actor, he was clearly far too old to play a convincing high schooler. The cars and racing were cool, for sure, but the whole time I just wondering about the original characters.",briancham1994,2020-06-01,2020
9.0,"Glossy, exciting bubblegum for the eyes and brain","The third installment in ""The Fast and the Furious"" series is possibly the best so far and was a pleasant surprise. I went into this film with low expectations but was genuinely thrilled by the film. As a devoted petrol-head, it doesn't take too much to start my heart pounding and the sight of the automotive pornography portrayed here certainly did the trick.Lucas Black takes over from Paul Walker as the lead in this high-octane thrill ride. Black's portrayal of car-fanatic Sean Boswell is spot-on. Scrumptious Nathalie Kelley is the female interest in this film while the bad guy is played by Brian Tee. The cast also contains Brian Goodman as Black's father, Sung Kang as Han, and Bow Wow as Twinkie. While most of the cast made me feel positively ancient, I still found the film involving and high-gloss entertainment.The numerous effects are beautiful, the Japanese scenery and backdrop is awesome and the whole film looks polished.I personally can't wait for the fourth installment, especially given the rumours of Vin Diesel's interest in it! 9 out of 10. An almost perfect sequel and worth viewing just to see the cars.",DVD_Connoisseur,2007-08-18,2007
7.0,Drifting into a Side Story: A Review of The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, released in 2006 (but still very watchable in 2025!), Like I said in my previous review for 2 Fast 2 Furious, this one also feels less like a direct sequel and more like a high-octane DLC or spin-off to the first two films. While it doesn't quite reach the heights of The Fast and the Furious or 2 Fast 2 Furious, it still manages to deliver a fun, albeit flawed, experience that car enthusiasts will likely enjoy.This installment shifts gears, leaving the familiar faces behind and introducing us to Sean Boswell, a troubled teen with a penchant for street racing. We get a fleeting glimpse of his life in America before he's shipped off to Tokyo to live with his estranged father. Here's one of the biggest drawbacks: Sean's backstory feels rushed and underdeveloped. His motivations beyond the need to escape trouble aren't fully explored. The absence of any real delving into his relationship with either his mother or father feels like a missed opportunity for emotional resonance, leaving them as mere plot devices rather than fully fleshed-out characters.The same can be said for the primary antagonist, DK, the ""Drift King"". While his scenes are effectively antagonistic, the movie glosses over his character beyond his rivalry with Sean and his connection to his mob-boss uncle. We barely scratch the surface of what drives him or his position in the Tokyo underworld, making him feel like a fairly one-dimensional villain. I think with more character development on DK and Sean's family, this would have been a much better movieDespite these shortcomings in character development, Tokyo Drift shines in other areas. The introduction of Han, with his effortlessly cool demeanor and laid-back wisdom, is a definite highlight. He quickly became a fan favorite for a reason, and his presence elevates the film. Neela, Sean's love interest, also provides a strong and engaging personality. She adds a layer of complexity to the story rather than just being a damsel in distress.Visually, Tokyo Drift is a treat. The detailed model cars, a reflection of the drift scene in Japan, are fantastic, and the vibrant soundtrack perfectly complements the fast-paced driving sequences. The film captures the neon-drenched, bustling atmosphere of Tokyo, creating an immersive and aesthetically pleasing experience. The drift sequences are exciting and entertaining, even if they don't always push the limits of reality. I think the cinematography and editing is quite good here.Overall, Tokyo Drift is a decent entry in the Fast & Furious franchise and is an enjoyable experience. It's a step down in terms of character development from its predecessors and feels more like a side story than a direct continuation, but It still delivers a visually engaging and entertaining ride. The Tokyo setting alone is worth the watch, and the introduction of Han makes for a memorable character. While not perfect, Tokyo Drift earns a solid 7/10, proving that even when the franchise takes a turn into a different street, it can still be enjoyable.",douglasc11,2025-01-04,2025

7.0,great cars great movie,"From the fast and the furious series, this film is one of the closest to its subject. The cast in the film, of course, does not reach the Oscar level, but not the worst either. The main character is not as charismatic and pleasant as Paul Walker, and the secondary characters, with the exception of Khan, are not as interesting as in the first two afterburners. It is quite possible to believe in the worldview and thinking of the characters. As for the plot, it looks quite logical and correct, but a little far-fetched. The combination of the mafia with street racing looks interesting, but at the same time a little strange, while watching, in principle, you don't think about it. Subplots such as the development of Lucas Black's character and Natalie Kelly's relationship are clichéd and simple. The cast in this fast and the furious film is new and it was a little unusual not to see the old people, and it's even a pity that they weren't there or they didn't participate in the film in any way. I think the fans would love that. As for the main icing on the cake for people watching this series of films, which is racing and cars, Justin Lin - the director of this film did an excellent job with this task. We see great tuned cars, and some of them are quite rare. It can be seen that they were not at all sorry for the moment with the breaking of one of the 350z, which makes us, the fans, very happy. Races are built in such a way that, from the point of view of logic and the most beneficial behavior of cars on the road, if you think about it, it's ridiculous. But despite all this, the action and beauty of drifting give you a great reason to close your eyes and just relax. And drifting in this film is the main driving technique. The film has some action, it's not hard to understand, it's a pleasure to watch because of the large number of cool and fancy cars that we never or very rarely see on our roads. He was created in order to lie down on his favorite sofa after a hard day, without loading his brain and enjoy what is happening in this film, which, in principle, he easily coped with as he should.",batyrkhanmanov,2022-09-08,2022
5.0,Karate Kid on wheels,"It's the exact same story as The Karate Kid only it takes places on wheels.. In Tokyo. Think about it.. New kid moves into town, gets defeated by the ‘villain’ early on, starts training, gets his revenge and wins the girl in the end.. Han may not have served as a mentor the same way Mr. Miyagi did but it's obvious where they got their inspiration from. Some people claim it's the weakest movie in the series while other claim it's their favorite. Personally I think it's one of the weaker ones but the standards are not particularly high to be fair. You watch these movies for the thrills and the hot woman, not for the ‘deep’ story, or lack thereof. This is the least action packed movie in the series and action is pretty much all this series has to offer. The Vin Diesel cameo was cool but that's the only thing positive I have to say about it.",askeland89,2024-06-08,2024

7.0,Okkk,"This is not so much a third part of speed and passion as a more appropriate one.

7.0,Best races and actually car focused,"The movie that initially was just a one-off that doesn't have any relation to the other two got the best car chase scenes and still is the most car-centric movie of the franchise. From the first second the music hits differently and then the racing immediately shows this is already way better than the 2nd part. It has conviction and heart to it that even some of the wacky themes, acting etc can be overlooked. It really makes no sense why the main character and everyone around him act as they do and why that actor was even chosen to be a 17-year-old when he doesn't even look young enough to be his actual age at the time. But the music and the races, the focus given on the drifting etc sweeps away everything else for the viewer. It's also wild that the character of Han and the director Justin Lin turned out to be kind of central figures in the future of the franchise. This is where the potential for the franchise really opened up even if it feels like a one-off.",Jithindurden,2023-04-20,2023
6.0,Main character ruins the movie,"Great cars and chase scenes in this movie. Based in Tokyo it made the perfect setting for a movie like this. So everything is great and this should easily be 9/10 movie but one thing and one thing only ruins this movie completely..... the main actor. How can the directors pick the most unlikable actor when everything else was spot on. I get the character in the movie is supposed to be some annoying juvenile but there were probably hundreds of other actors that would have played this role a million times better, even ones that are not overly famous. For example...Sean Faris (main actor from 'never back down') would have been perfect. But even Borat would have done a better job than the current actor. Completely missed opportunity for potentially one of the best films in this franchise.",Haris-Khan-72702,2023-11-16,2023
4.0,Awesome Right?,"I found this movie no more or no less entertaining than the other ""Fast and Furious"" films; sexy women, tough guys, fast cars, and not much else. I mean I'm sure Bow Wow with all his talent from ""All That"" and ""Like Mike"" was the best choice, but considering the role it doesn't really matter. And of course a main stream pop culture soundtrack to keep the pace of the movie. It couldn't possibly have added more creativity to the project right? Most people enjoy these films for the aforementioned things, oh and did I mention the enjoyably simplistic plot to boot? What's not to like? With that said, in all seriousness, I can't rate crap higher than I already have, otherwise I'd be insulting film makers who actually strive to make a movie instead of an ninety minute music video.",gigan-92,2011-07-04,2011

The setting of Tokyo was a great choice and fresh. I didn't know MC Hammer owns that city. Sonny Chiba was cool but this Sung Kang guy is a stud. Can't wait to see him in other films. Oh yeah, the third chase gets even better and unlike other films, the last one actually lives up to its worth.

6.0,"It's okay, but far from great.","If it wasn't for this movie being incorporated into the franchises overall story I think I might be less enthusiastic about it. Because other than the character of Han and a few good races there's not a lot I like about Tokyo Drift. Sure it's easy to just say this movie sucks because it lacks most of are favorite characters, and I'd be hard-pressed to disagree with that. But even this movies story is kinda lame. I know people praise this movie for really giving you a feel for the culture, but I'm not a car guy so that doesn't really matter to me.What matters to me when I watch a F&F movie is great, exciting action/racing scenes and a half decent story. I know it's F&F so asking for an elaborate story is comical to say the least. But Tokyo Drifts story is really hindered by that fact that 90% of the characters are in high school. So the result is a movie that feels smaller than the ones that came before it, and with far less stakes for it's characters than the ones that come after it. All in all if you stack it up against some of the others it doesn't compare, but as a standalone movie it's alright.",joshua-c-s-1996,2018-03-04,2018

10.0,Superb flick,"Greetings from Lithuania.The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) is must see to fans of the franchise. Filled with good performances (really, did i just said that?) and good story, this chapter truly delivers. Being first directing effort in the series by Justin Lin - Tokyo Drift captured what fans (and not only them) have truly wanted from the movie, an involving story, fast cars, different approach to races, interesting characters. I truly believe that Tokyo Drift is the second best chapter in the franchise after superior ""Fast Five"". It delivers on every aspect. I saw it 3 time (more than any picture in the franchise), just because this movie it first off all about something, it has true real plot, with main character we start to care. Overall, Tokyo Drift is truly great entertainment all around. It has everything that can expect from the series and more - a really involving story. Barvo, great film.",851222,2014-10-31,2014

1.0,I say nothing positive of this film in this review.,"What is it about Hollywood that makes it think that people are satisfied with a movie with all that is negative about this one? It makes no sense to me. A place known around the world as a place where movies are born that provide us with entertainment and, within that entertainment, emotional fulfillment. We follow a story that intrigues us through a lens that fits the mood and the style of the story, through the guise of actors that can portray characters that we, as the audience, see as good company for 2 hours. This movie has no story. The story of this third installment in the tinsel Fast and the Furious franchise is simply a moronic string of events that sometimes glares with a lack of knowledge in a field that it tackles. For instance, our hero, who the writer must've forgotten to equip with a personality, is in police custody for another of several seriously destructive street racing crashes, and so for the convenience of the plot, the guy is sent to live with his father, who is involved with the military, in Tokyo. Basically, because the guy committed enough serious crimes, he gets a free ticket to Tokyo.I don't know why I pressed return at all, as if I am to begin another paragraph stating how bad this movie is. Why did I do that? I say the less attention we give to movies like this, the more the probability is of studio execs realizing that it is finally less advantageous for them to make such crap. I mean, I was happy earlier on when I came to its IMDb page upon seeing it and finding that its user rating was somewhere in the 3's, where, to speak as generously as I can, it belongs, but it's crept up into the 5's. Join in the revolt! Send this movie back down the rating scale! Quickly, before some innocent film-goer looks at it and doesn't think the rating is low enough to ensure that they shouldn't risk seeing it!I wasn't fond of this film.",jzappa,2006-09-12,2006
6.0,Best Performance: Anything Not Moving,"The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) * (out of 4) The third film in the series has redneck teen Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) being sent to Tokyo to live with his father. Once there he gets mixed up with another high school punk who just happens to be the nephew of a powerful gangster (Sonny Chiba). The first film in this series was good and the follow-up wasn't too bad when you considered everything that it was. This third film, however, is a complete disaster from the word go and it's rather shocking that this here didn't put an end to the entire series. I'm not going to overstate something by calling this one of the worst movies ever made because it isn't. However, I'm really not sure I can say this isn't one of the dumbest movies ever to come out of Hollywood. When you look at the budget of this thing one really has to wonder where it all went because it's obvious that nothing was spent on an acting coach. This film contains some of the worst acting I've seen from any professional movie. There are moments here that are simply so bad that you can't help but want to laugh at the scene and this is especially true during the introduction to the Sean character when he picks a fight with a football jerk. There's really nothing but one bad performance after another and it really makes you wonder if perhaps the director simply didn't care because he knew no one goes to a film like this expecting ""acting."" This might be true but you have to give us something better than this. I also found the racing scenes to be quite boring and they're actually worse than what was in the second film. They lack any real imagination and I'd argue that they rarely make any sense. THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT is a pretty awful film from the word go but at least we get to see Chiba but at the same time it's sad seeing him waste time in something like this.",Michael_Elliott,2013-05-08,2013

6.0,Was a good movie,"""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" is a mixed bag of a movie. On the one hand, it delivers on the promise of high-speed racing and exciting car chases that fans of the franchise have come to expect. The drifting sequences, in particular, are impressive and visually stunning. The movie also benefits from its unique setting in Tokyo, which adds a fresh and interesting perspective to the franchise.However, the movie also suffers from a lackluster plot and forgettable characters. The story feels flat and uninspired, with a predictable and clichéd plotline that offers little in the way of surprises. The characters are also underdeveloped, with none of them being particularly memorable or interesting.The movie's lead, played by Lucas Black, is particularly bland, with little charisma or personality to speak of.

9.0,The Fast and the Furious reborn in Tokyo,"When I first heard about Tokyo Drift and realised that it would feature none of the original cast members, I was sure it would be a major let down that was just cashing in, so I ignored it. Eventually, I sat down to watch the movie when it arrived on Sky and I must say that I'm impressed. The film more than exceeded my low expectations and whilst it way a little bit routine in places, I had a great time watching it.Not only is this film a damn good car/action film in it's own right, it is arguably the best in the series. The new cast is great with Lucas Black heading up the roster as Sean Boswell, an American street racer who moves to Japan and becomes embroiled in the underworld Tokyo street racing scene. Black proves to be better to watch than Paul Walker was in the previous movies in the franchise because he is a better actor (which isn't saying much but still...), whilst the other characters all have chemistry on screen too, creating an authentic Japanese street racing feel. The stand out character in the movie for me though was Sung Kang as Han, easily the coolest character in the film.Justin Lin does a great job of capturing the art of drifting as well as keeping a good sense of speed and a focus on the character development. Whilst it's never going to win any Oscars, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is infinitely better than 2 Fast 2 Furious and is in some ways better than the original movie too. If Lin can continue this trend into the fourth film in 2009, I will be the first in line at the cinema to see Vin Diesel return to the franchise.If like me, you were initially put off by the lack of ties to the first two movies, give Tokyo Drift a chance and you'll probably find you'll enjoy it. Car fans should have no problems liking the subject matter (Cars and beautiful girls) and whilst it doesn't make you think a whole lot, you really can't go wrong with the 3rd effort in the popular Fast and Furious franchise. Oh and by the way, the last scene is guaranteed to make fans of the series smile, the movie is worth watching just for that.",matt19007,2008-05-05,2008
6.0,"2 Fast, 2 Furious ... but unfortunately 2 Much","Lucas Black takes the leading role from Paul Walker in this the third outing of the Fast & Furious series, that - unlike the previous two movies - focuses on the art of 'drifting'. Director Justin Lin does a decent enough job here, with a lot to contend with from its superb predecessors. The setting is the streets of Tokyo, Japan, as Lucas Blacks character is shipped off from the US to Japan in order to avoid jail. There he gets involved in the underworld car racing, or should I say car drifting, scene.The acting is average at best, with the relatively unknown Black doing the best he can, but clearly lacking experience. The racing scenes are, as expected, top notch, but the plot just seems silly, and it is these racing scenes that are needed to carry the film through to the end. The main problem with this film is that it really needed a stronger on screen presence, but since none of the original cast returned and all the actors are relatively unknown this was clearly lacking. Overall it was an average attempt at a movie. The action is good but the acting and plot struggle throughout, and I think personally this was significantly lacking when compared to the first two movies. Without spoiling the film, there is a nice surprise during the final couple of minutes, that added a point to my rating, but it wasn't enough. It gets an average rating of 6-10 - watchable.C><",craigy101,2006-07-04,2006

The other thing that annoys me is that I have a very hard time believing that there really is such a racing subculture in Tokyo. People dress like that in Japan!

6.0,"The Worst Of ""TFATF"" Movies, But Still Worth Watching","The third movie in the ‘Fast And The Furious’ movies — but chronologically takes place much later in the series — has a teenager (played by Lucas Black) sent to school in Tokyo because he's been a naughty boy in America and his illegal racing activities will get him sent to prison unless he goes to another country to live with his father. Huh? What? Hey, never mind this isn't a movie about logic and realism. Anyway Black is now in Tokyo, gets the hots for a classmate who is dating a gangster (played by Brian Tee), and is introduced to drifting (a controlled, sideways movement of a fast moving car). Ah! ‘Tokyo Drift’ you say with a big grin. Not wanting to look like a punk who can't drive, Black is taken under the wing of ‘TFATF’ alumni Han (played by Sung Kang) to be taught how to drift so Black can settle all his problems by racing and drifting. Makes sense? No? Well, it's not supposed to! This movie is for people who like to drive fast cars and want to see crazy, fast driving in the movies. I'm one of those people, but I also appreciate a well-written story. Oh, well, at least I get half of what I want. My most memorable, movie moment of ‘The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift’ is the scene when **SPOILER ALERT** Kang is being chased by Tee, and Kang's car flips over and explodes, killing Kang. Why is this so memorable to me? Because the Han character played by Kang is my favorite in all of ‘TFATF’ movies. Although ‘Tokyo Drift’ is my least favorite movie of this series, it still ties in to the storyline, especially to the later movies, so it's a must see for ‘TFATF’ fans.

7.0,Street racing is back with attention to drifting this time,"This is a sequel that has almost nothing to do with the previous two movies in this franchise. With that being said, this is still a pretty good sequel but that could be because I had a low expectation for this movie. And even if there is some plot holes in this story, it is still a engaging movie. This one also has some of the most entertaining race sequences, at least compared to the previous movies in this franchise. The racing scenes and chase scenes are a very well done, especially the execution of it all including the drifting. The acting in this movie isn't anything really good but the character Han Lue(Sung Kang) stood out because of his charisma and his laid back attitude. So it's cool he is going to be in the ""Fast Five"" movie in 2011. Overall the story is ridiculous like the previous two movies, but it's still a pretty entertaining and to some degree engaging. This is a movie that some car fanatics can relate with, especially fans of import cars and drifting.7.3/10",KineticSeoul,2011-04-28,2011
2.0,disappointing,"A friend of mine highly recommended this movie to me, promising me that i would enjoy the racing scenes and babes. I was however utterly disappointed in the storyline and especially the racing scenes. I admit that this show consists of some good cinematography and effects, but however, the storyline is almost non existent and highly predictable. first of all, being a fan of Japanese tuned cars and drift racing, i was especially looking forward to high tempo and skilled drifting scenes with maybe some technical stuff in the dialogues. sad to say, there was none of both. If your idea of a good race involves cars ramming each other until one crashes out first, this is the movie for you. hong kong's initial d movie (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0439630/) would provide a slightly more interesting watch despite it being based on a Japanese manga. that being said, i would reckon that i can't expect high quality racing (just like from the Japanese street racing dvds i acquired somewhere) from an action movie, but to sum it all up, the highest point in the fast and the furious: tokyo drift, was the scene where the cute little Japanese girl accidentally exposes her red panty while uncrossing her legs for a split second before the final race",disarmed-1,2006-08-10,2006

6.0,OK for a 3rd installment in a franchise,"Justin Lin's first foray into the fast and furious franchise is rather the odd one out in the series, as it contains none of the original cast and is out of sequence from the rest of the films. But it is an interesting and refreshing film for the franchise. New lead character Sean Boswell (Lucas Black). After getting in trouble in America is forced to move to Tokyo to live with his father. Here he gets involved with Drift racing, Yakuza and future series regular Han Seoul-Oh (Sug Kang). I know fast and furious films are things that don't get dragged down exposition and plot. But even so this film does seriously lack any sort of plot. The acting at times is atrocious, and with Lucas Black you are wishing for a quick return of Vin Diesel and Paul walker. What is unusual, but very good especially for an action film. Is the actual use of Tokyo instead of just a weird, exotic location for are fish out of water scenario. We get to see bits of Japanese culture for example in locations used such as the Pachinko parlour,or a rather humorous scene involving a sumo wrestler,and many others. Justin Lin is a decent director and his decision to use drifting as the type of racing in the film does open it up for some beautiful shots that car fanatics will love.Overall the film is dramatically awful. But the actions beats and the use of Tokyo. Make this an interesting addition to the franchise.",paulsrobinson,2013-05-24,2013

Complete and utter disgrace to the legacy Paul Walker left to ""The Fast and the Furious"" movies.

I like him because he is the most lively character and full of responsibility. He feels real to me because i like his drifting skills and I wish one day i could be able to drift like him. I like drifting and racing parts because since i was younger i watch only racing films and i watched all fast and furious episodes. This episode impresses me with sporty and modified cars for instance, Nissan 350Z(driven by Takashi) Mazda RX-7 (driven by Han). I found this frustrating because i didn't supposed Han would die in this episode and i have no idea why in the ending of fast furious 6 they cut the scene which Han dies to put in that episode.",yeanaphirak,2015-11-18,2015

After his moving to Tokyo he learns about drift and the illegal races there and gets involved. Finally after many races and many lessons about drift he becomes a major competitor in the world of drift racing.",Thanos_Alfie,2013-11-10,2013
1.0,terrible,"ooh my god. that was a mess. i didn't like it at all. it is like they gathered the ugliest people in the world in this movie. that dude (shan or whatever), what is wrong with his speech? i mean he cant talk normally, and to be honest the other main characters of the previous ""fast and furious"" series were like prince charming compared to this one. and that Japanese dude (DK) he is too ugly too. i didn't like the way he looks at people and the way he talks. and the scenario was horrible too. the only thing i liked in this movie was the cars. and of course bow wow. he plays damn good, and talks cool. he met my expectations. i voted this movie 1 out of 10. this movie sucks.",matricha,2006-07-02,2006
6.0,Movie Review & Cultural Commentary,"So, I went to see The Fast & the Furious: Tokyo Drift on Monday night with my girl friends, partially cause I really wanted to see it and partially because it was a great escape from the sweltering heat. I'm not a huge fan of pimped out cars, but I am a fan of Justin Lin (Better Luck Tomorrow is AMAZING, and everyone should see it) and hot leading men. Although the movie isn't Casablanca or anything the Oscars committee needs to keep its eye on, for what it is, Justin Lin does a great job with the silly plot and worn-down franchise. The cinematography of the movie is something to be reckoned with. Lin takes advantage of his Tokyo location and incorporates it quite nicely into the film. During one of the race scenes, Lin purposefully takes the chase to a stand still as the car takes a sharp corner, and while the contrast between the bright, flickering Tokyo lights against the paused car creates an aesthetically pleasing and memorable image, it also reminds the audience of the stark differences between street racing in Japan versus in the United States. As depicted early on in the film, street racing in the States merely attests to the speed and power of a car, and in a land where Roosevelt reminded us to talk softly and carry a big stick, how is it surprising that Americans constantly feel the need to prove the existence of its balls, from the government's decision to invade Iraq all the way down to the debased form of street racing? However, Japanese culture feverishly pulses with both life, beauty, and, most importantly, control. It thrives on diversity, and its contradictions only enrichen it. Japan is a country where the mountains still resonate with the lives of vegetable farmers and long-gone Samurais, but, at the same time, it is also a country where the yen takes off at rocket speed and sets the ever-soaring standard in technology and fashion (Harajuku, yes?). Therefore, it's not surprisingly that even something as uncharacteristically uncouth as street racing also embodies the unusual amalgam of speed and control in the form of drifting- and Lin is very well aware of this. His mix of testosterone-heavy chase sequences intermingled with its decelerated moments celebrates both Lin's love for the fast pace Tokyo lifestyle and the country's eastern spiritual roots. Moreover, Lin's beautiful, soft camera work depicts the care and subtleness that drifting embraces as opposed to American racing where it's all gas and all adrenaline without the gentleness. And for a director to convey this cultural gap, in a moment in the midst of raw action no less, is a stroke of talent. And while the main lead oozes Southern charm with his crooked smile and drawl, the Asian male leads hold their own in comparison, especially Sung Kang, who also starred in Lin's shattering Better Luck Tomorrow debut. Among all the Asians in the film, Kang is the only one (that I know of at least) that speaks English fluently and as a first language. In casting Kang, Lin introduces a character that many Asian Americans can relate to, unlike the sushi chefs and calculus nerds that Asians most frequently portray. Kang plays the character Han, a mobster that sympathizes with army brat, Sean Boswell, as he tries to break into the homogeneous Japanese underground street-racing world. Han is foremost an American, and only then does he identify with his Asian heritage. Because of his own American status, Kang's character is able to understand and befriend Boswell, but, simultaneously, his Asian features open a door into the exclusive Japanese culture. Furthermore, while Asian characters in the media tend to be the villain or the wimp, Han is neither. Yes, Han engages in illegal activity, like the typical, one-dimensional bad guy, but his character endears the audience with his low-key dialogue and half-smile. At moments, Han appears almost reluctant to embed himself in further shady dealings, as when he explains to Boswell that he has enough money and not enough loyal friends, but at other moments, he soaks in the lifestyle of Cristal and fast cars. Kang's convincingly complex Han is enough that even if one isn't a competitive street racer and mafioso (as many are not, I hope), a casual movie go-er will relate to the character's duality, whether Asian or not. Or maybe I'm just reading too far into a boy movie.",nagolberry,2006-06-23,2006
6.0,RE: Why doesn't somebody make a documentary on street racing?,"If you go onto YouTube and search for ""street racing documentary"" you will see that finally one has been made. It can also be found on the website 1320movie (dot com) as well. It is unique in that it examines the ""Fast and Furious"" series and comments on it. Many people have issues with there not being enough ""real street racing"" within the film. In other words they are accusing the producers of faking the scene. The ironic part now is that from what I hear on the newest installment, Universal actually finally hired consultants to help them keep the film more real and less ""hollywood."" This is especially important as the automotive community in general is highly technical and will/has picked apart this series and it is joked about frequently --- As it is in the new documentary ""1320 A West Coast Story."" I guess next year we'll see if the consultants were worth the money on this 4th installment...",mattgoff,2008-09-21,2008
6.0,Lead actor has zero charisma,"What a wasted opportunity. I enjoyed so much of it but Lucas Black ruined it for me. His accent, due to the uniqueness of it, although real sounds so fake. Terribly made up and forced. It made for a really looooooong movie. He sounded strange in the American setting but in Tokyo- ridiculous. I'd buy it if he made up for it with his acting but to quote someone on reddit ""has the charisma of a wet blanket"". Nor was he hot enough to be a main character in this. He didn't interest me enough to make me root for him like the other movies in the franchise. Luckily there's plenty of other f&f movies to watch.",sallymichellenelson,2023-11-09,2023
1.0,even the cars couldn't save it,"Truly, this is one of the worst movies ever made. Being a Fast and the furious fan, and working as a car journalist, I couldn't wait the see the movie on the day of release. I heard that this part of the sequel has nothing to do with the first two, but all the hype about the film convinced me. I love tuned machines and drifting - moreover they held the first two drift championships in Hungary last month -, so the fantastically built Japanese cars pulled me in the movies. But even these drop-dead rides couldn't save my evening. I knew that Rhys Millen, two-time drift champion will be the main stunt driver, and the driving scenes will leave me amazed because of their professional execution. But there wasn't enough enjoyable action, and needless to say, the plot was horrible, rather ridiculous, and the actors were cherry, lacking any empathy. In Hungary, we had two official drift days so far, which attracted people from all over the country. A young sport, which needs months of practicing. Shaun Boswell acquired his skills in a couple of days, put a Skyline engine and transmission in a 60's Ford Mustang in one night, than after an aggressive touge battle with the bad guy, he was crowned the new drift king. How easy that was. But the filmmakers wanted a happy end.",Dzsinn,2006-07-30,2006
8.0,"Fast Action, Hot babes, Heartpumping Thrill....money WELL WORTH IT!!","OK, NO one would doubt that Fast & the Furious part I was the best of all since it had action and a storyline. Hated part II but this one really rocked! I walked into the theater thinking mind numbing trilogy but i was surprised at the FX and the photography and the action sequence BLOWS YOUR MIND! you have to watch it to believe it! These kinda movies are not based on good storyline or anything but pure heart pumping action. From the streets of Tokyo and the narrow roads and the uphill drive...its amazing and money well worth it. If you are into meaningful movies then don't go to this one. If you're looking to escape reality and see some amazing action then DEFINITELY go see this movie. Don't expect much from this movie and you will come out over satisfied. Director Justin has been amazing. I'm looking forward to see more of his movies. Also there is a surprise in the movie.",kmr_jy,2006-06-13,2006
7.0,Fast Furious Tokyo Drift,"Let me start out by saying ""why god why did you let the second movie in this series happen"". Paul ""douchebag"" Walker's acting in both of the first two movies was on par with the acting skills of a retarded kitten on mescaline. The first movie was made by Vin Diesel alone. The second movie was dead in the water when Vin Deisel left, killed by Paul Walker, but Tyrese and Ludicrous were the nails in the coffin. Needless to say, I formed a discrimination against musicians in movies. (Mos Def in anything*) But in Tokyo Drift, Lil Bow-Wow was surprisingly good in his role as Twinkie, although several gay jokes always followed his name being said. I'm glad to say that, although Lucas Black left something to be desired, like more emotion, his southern drawl is fitting for the farm boy classic American aspect of the main character. There are a HELL of a lot of Japanese people in this movie. NOT racist, just sayin. After all, it IS Japan... If you've never seen drifting and you like cars go see this movie. When this movie comes out on DVD I will be buying it and adding it to my collection. Many people may disagree with me because of a thin plot, etc but this movie strikes a place in my heart that loves drifting. And calling Lil Bow Wow twink. The Fast and the Furious; Tokyo Drift gets: 6/10 for creativity. 3/10 for romance. 9/10 for racing sequences. 10/10 for having a 25 year old play a high schooler(Zachary Ty Bryan).total 7/10 * Coincidentally mos def does a song on the soundtrack. I recommend bringing earplugs.",koffeekan,2006-06-21,2006
1.0,A ride to the puddle of feces on the highway,"This movie earns an A+ in the category of awfulness. The movie had a plot deep enough to entertain a brain dead monkey, but that's about it. Not only did the movie's atrocious lack of a plot contribute to its badness, but so did the acting. Justin Lin might as well have hired cardboard cutouts because they would have done a better job of acting than the actors did. Also, why of all people was Lucas Black cast? By far one of the worst actors of the movie. Another disheartening aspect was the general skankyness of the female gender in the movie. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for miniskirts and high heels in front of twenty-inch chrome rims, but there is a point of taking it too far. Whoever was in charge of deciding what cars to put in the movie should not be in the television industry at all. When watching this movie I got the feeling that I was looking at cars in a high school parking lot because of all the horrific body mods and 'fart in a can' sounding exhausts. Aside from all this, the ONLY possible way to make this movie worse would be to have all the characters in the work be street racing zombies. Oh wait, that would actually be an improvement. Job well done Justin Lin. Thank you in continuing to further downgrade car culture and produce a film that is utter nonsense.",takethe_veil,2009-06-27,2009
10.0,Blew Me Away,"There is no doubt that automobile racing is becoming an obsession in many parts of the world, including Japan, it seems. Tokyo is a city full of lights and music and also a dark side, including gangsters and reckless racers, much like the untamed America of the prohibition era. Lucas Black, a rebellious Alabama teen racer, is sent to his father in Tokyo to settle down. Instead, Lucas learns the sport of ""drift racing"" from Japanese gangster youth in which racers use spinning tires and their brakes to make fast turns around the curves of parking garages and mountain roads. Those who aspire to win smiles from the foxy Japanese girls and the admiration of Japanese males have to win these drifting contests. Despite a steep learning curve, young Lucas does not disappoint in this matter. This movie has superb photography of the beautiful people and stirring landscapes of Tokyo. The exciting action and inspiring music have to be experienced to be believed. The ensemble of young men and women does a great job of providing a glimpse of this advanced culture of modern Japanese youth, overflowing with style and passion. This movie skillfully shows off modern Japan as perhaps a neglected subject of cinema. And, the well-crafted and intricate plot is full of teenage rivalry and violence, similar to an updated ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" very fascinating and passionate.",phillipstephenso,2006-06-17,2006
6.0,Asian short skirted chicks and cars,"To be honest, this has nothing to do with the franchise storywise. Sure, it contains a lot of car chasing and racing but overall this should have been given another title, leave out The Fast And The Furious, should just have been called Tokyo Drift. Maybe I overreact because toward the end there's a link to the franchise. And nowadays we all know that Lucas Black as Sean returns in part 7.I can understand that teenagers will love this flick due the beautiful girls in it. And car lovers are looking forward to see the old school Ford Mustang towards the end but there's nothing more to pick up here then pedal to the metal scene's. On part of the story it's all so predictable. You know it, this is just about cars and racing and the racing sequences are the series' meat. If you love gleaming cars and short skirted Asian temptresses then this is your thing. But the teaser towards the end with Vin returning makes you looking forward to entry 4. As much as I didn't like him in the first entry here he shows in 1 minute were it's all about.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5",trashgang,2013-09-23,2013
4.0,The dude looks 40,"If you are looking for some backup noise while you do some housework this is great for that. Other than that it's really bad.

He suppose to be someone who don't really care about school only cars, yet he learns perfect Japanese in a few weeks. And this is just one annoying thing, the story has so many plot holes , I stopped counting. Why is he sent to Japan in the first place, who sends criminals to live in a foreign country as a punishment? If his father is in military why don't they live in the military base? And why does the Yakusa have any interest in high school drifting? And so on.... Its just bad, yet somehow better than the first sequence because that was even worse.",nyiri-timea,2016-08-21,2016
6.0,Tokyo Riptide,"First off, let me start saying this film is very different from the first two. While they had a great plot and a story well written, ""Tokyo Drift"" intended more in action scenes without much character development or interesting behaviors. Out of three American actors, Bow Wow was the only who had a decent acting-- and he's not even an actor. The Japanese cast is very professional and I'm impressed with their work. Moving the story to Japan is reasonable because it will change many aspects of the previous films, but sadly isn't enough to make the movie good. Too bad the only things that I really enjoyed about this experimentation project are the soundtrack and the racing scenes, since the cheesy dialogs and the campy characters ruined many minutes of this movie. People in their early teens are the target of this, undoubtely. See it only as entertainment, and you'll be not that disappointed.",raulfaust,2011-09-07,2011
7.0,Seemed like they wanted to do more...,"I saw the first two F&F's. They were disappointing. When I heard this one was in Japan, I had to see it just for the fact that it was in Japan. While I was watching it, I felt like they really ***WANTED*** to do more with the movie. For instance, the scene with the father and the Japanese girl at the beginning, Twinkies selling of stuff, the two mechanics (Japanese) who appear kind of randomly throughout, Han's back story (why was he stealing? for what purpose? why didn't his ‘long time friend’ stick up for him? and why a seemingly nice guy is doing something that seems a bit out of his character), the token not-Japanese-but-hot-enough-to-get-the-leads-attention chick and about her past, as well as the main bad guys background about his Yakuza connections and why his uncle tolerates his little ‘play Yakuza’ thing he's doing. *Spoiler part* I even felt like there should have been some kind of hints towards the ending of the film and the connection to the last scene and the character they mention (it seems like there should have been SOME hints!) All in all, the movie was a huge improvement over prior installments, though its still not a very good movie in its own right (without Japan and all the scrumptious Japanese girls, I probably would have lost interest quicker), but I kept feeling like they really really ***WANTED*** to do something more than they did with the film.",justonemore65,2007-04-25,2007

10.0,A love letter to import fans everywhere,"In my honest opinion, this movie was probably the best movie of the first Fast and Furious trilogy.It took you to Japan (a place the Otaku inside of me always wanted to go), exposed you to the flashy streets of Tokyo, showed you the mountain highways, and taught you how to drift.When I first watched this movie, I was in 9th grade, and it was absolutely brilliant, the colors were vibrant, the soundtrack was awesome, and there was this one great character called 'Han' played by Sung Kang. He was, and still is the definition of suave/cool, this guy was like the big brother you never had. He demonstrated a lot of talent, making his heartbroken character believable, and also acted as a guide to the audience, showing them the underground of drifting in Nippon.The main character in Sean (Lucas Black) was by far one of the worst actors I have ever seen. Definitely not a believable 17 year-old, not curious, and his wonky accent really tore the movie up, incredibly.Instead, I used the character Sean as a metaphor for ignorance (which the character excelled at greatly). Of course, when one goes to a different country with or without research, there is a learning curve, but it was hard for Sean to adjust because he was so set in his ways, and ultimately wound-up disrespecting many people, leading to the death of xxxxxxxxx.You could say Sean is your link, or avatar in Tokyo Drift, and just pretend you're very ignorant, and don't know how to use the internet.The actor who played Drift King Takashi did a stellar job, right up there with Han, and Morimoto was great. Lil Bow Wow gets a lot of unwarranted criticism for his character in Twinks, but he was really good at taking the pressure off of things, as a comedy relief character. Neela was a believable character, you'll love her, no doubt.The cars were absolutely amazing, my personal favorite was the Mazda RX-7 Veilside Fortune S6 13B that belonged to Han. I loved how they made areference to Initial D, by mentioning the Toyota Corolla AE86.The women are pretty in Tokyo Drift, cue some lewd joke.-.5 My only knocks on this movie were the facts that Sean Boswell was poorly written, and the actor was more wooden that a hollow oak cabinet.-.5 Although the pacing was great, keeping you interested all the way, I feel like this movie was way too short, it could have been elaborated upon, and someone shouldn't have died.FAST FURIOUS 7: The story from Tokyo Drift, the last chronological entry of the FAST series goes full-circle when the 7th movie pick-off where Tokyo Drift ended.Hopefully someone will be resurrected.Justin Lin is an absolute treat to have as director.Hopefully, James Wan (new director for F7) can provide the same level of storytelling, and explosiveness the series had with Justin Lin.Although, he is coming to a party, where everyone is already drunk.",ShockHour,2013-07-06,2013
6.0,Addicted to drifting and Japan Automotives.,"The movie is good, old-fashioned genre cinema done in a no-nonsense, straightforward style that is uncommon these days. The plot, about a troubled adolescent sent overseas to be straightened out, is completely conventional. Director Justin Lin demonstrates a talent for energetic filmmaking that was not even hinted at in his debut effort. Chris Morgan, the screenwriter, is well-versed in genre standards, providing just enough personality qualities to imprint characters in the minds of viewers. Sean Black plays a habitual screw-up who maintains his confidence and sense of humour in the face of adversity.",Mysterygeneration,2021-12-23,2021
2.0,"So fake, it's embarrassing to watch","Some juvenile delinquent kid from the States ends up in Tokyo to race the locals sums up this rather shallow movie.Everything about this movie is inauthentic.

There aren't that many English speaking Japanese in Tokyo as shown, and one Korean punk doesn't make a Yakuza (no offense to the Koreans - they are exceptionally fine people. The no brain is the guy who made this movie).If you want to see the street racing culture of Japan, Initial D is a better movie to watch. Even the Hong Kong version of Initial D did 1000 times better job than this one.What's shown in this movie is essentially America with Asian American actors pretending to be Japanese.Pretty disappointing, and not a well formulated movie.",ebiros2,2011-07-09,2011
8.0,Car chases the right way,"I'm not going to waste my time talking character or plot, because this movie is not about that. The filmmakers were smart to keep both at a minimum and focus on what is truly the best about these films. The chases. This time I think it totally delivers. The chases are not CG video game but real and dangerous. And that's the one thing I appreciated most. Danger in chases. It was just amazing watching these cars flying down streets and seeing all the subtleties of a ton of mass in motion, not knowing if it's going to crash or get crushed. As a bonus the music rocked and the girls were hot! In the end, a well done popcorn movie. Good work.",guilltoro44,2006-06-14,2006
7.0,Fast and The Furious goes back to high school and to Tokyo.,"This is the third installment in the Fast and The Furious franchise and it takes the story back to high school where a teenager named Sean Boswell seems to have gasoline in his veins but might be a little light on the brains as he keeps challenging people to race...even with a car that isn't his, in a country he doesn't know. Sean is a Navy brat whose mom has had to move around because of his street racing and getting into trouble. After a massive crash in a new development he is given a choice, either go live with his dad in Tokyo or go to juvie.That is how we end up in Tokyo and how Sean ends up learning how to drift when he locks horns with a Yakuza mob boss' nephew. He meets and makes friends with a little hustler named Twinkie and gets on the good side of Han who becomes his mentor. We find out later thanks to a cameo by Dom himself that Han and Dom used to run together...otherwise there is no real connection to the first two films.Definitely better than the second film, there are lots of great race scenes with some pretty good street racing stunts performed by their stunt drivers. Lots of drool worthy cars for the gear heads out there and done of the shortest skirts I have ever seen inname life.Great action entry in the series with a better story than the second film (and better race scenes), but still not as good as the original film.",cgvsluis,2023-05-30,2023

7.0,"Exactly what's expected to be a ""car drifter""","(2006)The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift
ACTION DRAMAIn order to appreciate this film, one must first like to see street racing films and alter his/her mind to not affiliate it with other ""Fast & The Furious"" films because none of the main stars are from anyone from the previous films but can be made entertaining as a film as it's own film! Story centers on rowdy American teenager whose known to drag race and always gets himself in trouble with the law but is the final straw, and he gets sent to Tokyo to live with his father to finish his schooling. Soon after he gets mixed up with another Japanese teenager whose associated with the Yakuza, Japan's equivalent of the mafia, with at the same time build rapport with another Asian person called Nam who also is attached to racing as well! The racing is not like the other races he's done on America but is introduced to 'race drifting' where the driver is driving around narrow roads and passageways like a tall building parking garage! Director Justin Lin must've seen a lot of Asian racing films such as ""Full Thottle"", ""The Legend of Speed"" and Jackie Chan's ""Thunderbolt"" to name a few where the acting is not so great but the racing scenes are the main focus and not so much on acting or story! Also interesting is that the film allows the actors to use their natural accents for there's an actress who has an Australian accent, natural Southern American accent and of course Japanese and Korean! There's some good one-liners and beautiful scenic buildings of downtown Tokyo, where the lights look great upon the reflections on the cars, and the techno pop soundtrack all works well with this film except that in terms of car crashes done on this film- it consists of stuff we had already seen before or done on previous films made before it, with the only difference that they're done on Tokyo and done on those specific models which there is nothing wrong with that too.",jordondave-28085,2023-09-25,2023
6.0,Better than the previous,"Enter the life of Shawn Boswell, a college student with a manic taste for car racing. After numerous counts of traffic offenses, his mother decides to shift him to Tokyo as a last resort to live in with his divorced dad after the last count of traffic offense could see him in jail if he was tried as an adult. However things in Tokyo didn't really change much in terms of illegal racing for Shawn except where racing is done in drifting style. Somewhat curious and somewhat enthusiastic with this new genre of racing, Shawn takes on the challenge of becoming the next Drifting King.Walking into this movie, I had not much anticipation of a great film, since it was apparent to me that even Paul Walker did not sign to this film and Lucas Black, who plays the lead role wasn't actually a familiar name in Hollywood. My hunch was about right, the film did not provide the kind of intensity I'd love to see in a racing film. However the movie itself isn't that bad on given the Hollywood special effects added to it. The real letdown of this film to me was for most part of the racing, which was done in drifting style, the cinematography captured the facial expression of the actors instead of highlighting the race which is deemed necessary if you want to exhilarate the audience. Very unlike in the first installment where we were treated with the cars being driven at dangerous speeds. But all wasn't that bad, since the movie did have it's funny moments and thrilling scenes. I especially enjoyed the first few minutes of the film before the hero was moved to Tokyo and also where Vin Diesel makes a cameo appearance at the ending.Overall the film was a lot better than the second installment which i believe was the worst in the franchise. Also a note to film goers who prefer drama based genre, really not the kind of movie u'd like to watch, since the plot was paper thin and kind of ludicrous if you really think about it.",HypercriticalHangdog,2006-06-21,2006

Unfortunately however, the person in charge of this movie actually knows nothing about cars and hardly any of it was actually filmed in Japan (most of it was actually done in California). Nonetheless, I really liked it, simply because the driving stunts were amazing and I'm a big fan of drifting. The cars are all a little too flashy for me, but it's to be expected when the name 'Fast and the Furious' is attached to the title, but still I really like what they did with it. People think that since it's a Fast and the Furious movie that it will such for some reason, or that it's childish. Personally, I think that's stupid on their part. Sure, the character development and the plots a little screwy at times, but in all honesty.... who really goes to see that anyway? It was even said in an article that most people go to see if for the cars and the magazine even admitted to the fact that the writer didn't even remember the names of the people in the first two.

1.0,This movie is the best vacuum cleaner I've ever seen. Too bad it wasn't supposed to suck.,"What did this movie have? Seriously, because I only seemed to notice what it was lacking: EVERYTHING! There were no hot guys, no hot cars, not hot music and no hot driving. There wasn't even any decent driving. The only half-decent driving came from the secondary characters and didn't influence the story at all, save for securing it a place in the deepest abyss on Earth! Those brilliant creators of Fast and the Furious were at it again, and I am extremely sad to say that they failed miserably. For instance, the closest thing they had to a good car was fitted with a jap crap engine. You do NOT do that to an American muscle car. Sure, to supe up your Honda Civic, maybe, but not to try and fix what I can only suppose is a Shelby Cobra GT350 by the look of the body. The car Vin Diesel was driving at the end was a close second for best car of a crap movie, perhaps even better than the Cobra, save for the fact that it's far too heavy to drift. I even have my doubts as to how they really got that Cobra to drift in the first place. You can't refit an engine in one night, plain and simple. Even if it's made for the car it's going in, it just doesn't happen. One thing I really, really don't understand, is how the heck they managed to pick up a 100-speed gearbox. I honestly didn't think they made those. The fact that they must have 100-speed gearboxes became apparent right at the beginning of the movie in the race against the High School Jock. Did you not notice how they shifted gears every five seconds? When one is speeding up, one does not put the gears down one, so the only logical solution is that they must have an infinite number of gears. Besides, how is it that they can always go just that *little* bit faster, anyway? I knew this movie wasn't going to be great, or good even, but I seriously didn't expect it to be this bad. I swear, the vacuum energy of this film could give a black hole a run for it's money. If you're wondering why I've only commented about the aesthetics of this film and not any of the technical parts, the reason is this: I have chosen not to talk about the bad scripting, hopeless casting and all-round bed cinematography of this film simply because it was so depressing that I can't even bring myself to analyze it. In it's defense, this movie had an excellent cast of brilliant, highly talented stunt drivers. It is unfortunate that the poorly work on all other perspectives of this movie made it simply shameful to watch. For me, this film was simply about a pig-headed, brainless Texan who breaks every car he touches and couldn't drive properly if his life, or perhaps even the planet, depended on it. Oh, and the fact that he goes around picking fights with everyone, just to prove he's the most annoying, punch-worthy person there is. I'm sorry, if you're looking for a fun, high-octane thrill, search for it elsewhere.",suicune1000,2006-07-10,2006
10.0,"i really liked this movie, it was really cool all the drifting and life in Tokyo.","This movie I really enjoyed. I've seen The Fast and The Furious a number of times, along with 2 Fast 2 Furious and so far this is the movie in the series that I most enjoyed. First of all, it introduced a relatively new racing style called drifting, and it featured new actors, not the same main character in Paul Walker. I found it cool that Bow Wow was in it, though I don't think he's the best actor ever. I found it cool that most of the movie was filmed on-site in Tokyo, Japan, though a few scenes were shot in L.A. in the Japanese part of the city. I liked the plot and the storyline and nothing at all in this movie was confusing. It was all understandable, and there were never any loose strings in any part. I'm liking the Fast and the Furious movies more and more and I can't wait until they make another one (hopefully)!!!! 10/10!!! with a bonus mark!",simba-37,2006-11-13,2006
7.0,Surprisingly Stellar Entry,"After the far-fetched yet successful second entry to this franchise, I don't think anyone was knowing what to expect from an entry that did not contain any of the original cast and would be taking the franchise in a slightly different direction. Directed by Justin Lin and written by Chris Morgan, Tokyo Drift follows a character named Sean, who is sent to Tokyo to live with his dad after he causes too much trouble while racing a snobby kid from his school. Not wanting to follow the rules that his father has set for him, he races in a drift race after his very first day of school, losing but befriending a group of racers who take them under their wing, particularly a character named Han. However, this also puts him at odds with the son of a mafia leader, whose girlfriend he falls for, named Neela. Naturally, this all leads to them having to race each other to prove who's better. While Tokyo Drift won't be winning the franchise any points for originality, it's still manages to stand out amongst the rest of the Fast and Furious films. Lin brings a lot more emotional depth to this film than the two previous installments, which is helped by Morgan's more down to earth portrayal of the characters. There's a lot more character development here, and a lot more dramatic weight to the plot than it just being a racing or action film. I also really like Lin's directorial approach. He focuses a lot more on the characters rather than the cars, and while the racing is still essential to the story, it's not the main highlight. Also, the father and son story line with Sean and his dad is a nice change of pace for a franchise like this. With that said, it's not perfect. Some of the character development really does fall into the cliché, particularly with the character of Neela. Her damsel in distress storyline really does feel out of place in a franchise where the female characters have been generally portrayed as very strong in will and mind. The acting is the biggest positive for this film and highlights the main strength in handing this franchise over to Justin Lin. He really pushes the actors to deliver great performances throughout the entire movie. Lucas Black, Bow Wow, Brian Tee and Sung Kang are all really good in this. The only real negative aspect to the acting comes from Nathalie Kelly. However, in fairness, I think it's far less to do with her acting ability, than the way the character is written in general, because as I stated earlier, the character is very out of place. So overall, this movie surprised me a little when I first saw it and continues to surprise me when compared to the rest of the franchise, outside of maybe the first movie. While the story is not original, it has a heart to it that really helps it along the way.",Ggconte,2022-11-15,2022
3.0,Can the Fast and the Furious franchise drive any lower? Yes it can.,"Can the Fast and the Furious franchise drive any lower? Here the story of petrolheads racing shiny cars around switches from the US to Tokyo, Japan adding something new to the franchise that appears to go on and on...An unknown cast doesn't help the film retain a degree of interest to the average viewer. Some of the characters are meant to be 17 years old but are several years older in reality. The only difference between Tokyo 'Drift' racing is there seems to be more twist and turn manoeuvres making frequent tyre changes necessary! I suppose it could make a good tourism video for Tokyo with its flashy streets?",tonypeacock-1,2023-05-11,2023
6.0,Some things work and some clearly don't,"Tokyo Drift was a great idea to do a film in a different country with a unique spin to it. The setting was great, the storyline was not bad and it had some good energy behind it. It also a nice departure from the main characters that drive the Fast and Furious franchise. A series could get stagnant after seeing the same people. Injecting some new blood and story adds flair and broadens the franchise.Tokyo Drift reminded me how important the main character is to carry the film. This is where things fall short. Lucas Black, the lead of this film, is a poor lead. From this terrible accent that is not believable to his subpar acting and mannerisms. He lacks appeal, charisma and is quite dull to watch. He is given poor support from Nathalie Kelley, the romantic interest who is dull and not interesting at all. Their on screen chemistry was weak. Brian Tee made a good villain but this was to no avail as the two main cast members do not carry this film. You end up having a somewhat lackluster film in the end. 6/10.",Kingslaay,2023-05-28,2023
6.0,This one finally had something,"Fast and furious 1 and 2 were one of the most awful car action films ever. Mostly the third one followed similar route but it was better in many ways.Plot was again pale, perhaps a little better than it predecessors had but still. Some action, some criminals, a non interesting love interest - all familiar from the previous films. There really is nothing to enjoy in that sense.Dialouges and characters were little better and so was acting.What makes it better was simply drifting. Now we could really enjoy some driving skill too. Some of the scenes were pretty technical and not very easy to do. Cars still looked rubbish though but the fact now our heroes and villains needed to actually do something else than drive a quarter mile made me pleased.Still - it went too far. There is no way when racing for a best place drifting would get you faster to the destination than regular driving. And the film frequently tried to convince us the other way. Drifting competitions are judged by the beauty, smoke and driving on the edge like being really close to other competitor but not by speed.But as I said at least there was something to watch not like in the first film for example where were only few boring and stupid races and nothing to enjoy at all.This one was slightly better in every way but it was far from perfect. Don't expect too much 6/10",christhjian,2011-12-30,2011
6.0,Introduction of Fast and Furious 3,"Fast and Furious 3 was filmed in Tokyo, Tokyo is the most important world-class city in Asia. It is also one of the traditional four world-class cities in the world, ranking the top four in the global city index. In addition, Tokyo is also the most livable city in the world.Sean has to leave the U. S. without going to jail for illegal racing, after that, Sean went to Japan and saw the Japanese racing culture, and there is enmity and malice between Sean and Drift King, they need to solve their problems through racing.Many famous spots in Tokyo are also introduced in the movie, my favorite scene is Sean and Drift King flicking on the streets of Shibuya, the number of people crossing the famous intersection in a single pass can reach 3,000, that is crazy.",aaaa-93149,2021-11-29,2021

It doesn't even consider the fact that the movie has no place in the quadrilogy. This 3rd installment is an embarrassment to the series. Its just a story they tried to get people to like just because the title has fast and furious in it. I was wondering even from the title what connection this movie had with the other 2. It didn't. It was a pathetic excuse of a movie. Don't bother wasting money on this move. Buy 1,2 and 4 but not 3. It makes no sense. However Laurel, I disagree. Drifting is really cool.

10.0,Best movie! Please make a Sequel!,"This movie is amazing! Well what can I say, the Soundtrack, plot, cars! The cast! The Women! Everything! was beautiful and amazing. This is definitely my favorite racing/car movie of all time. I love how the city and culture is shown in the movie. I been to Tokyo Japan a couple times and the city was right on. Who doesn't love drifting? As a race fanatic I love how the drifting was done and explained. I guarantee by the end of movie it will leave you wanting to see a second one. Compared to the regular series, this movie is all about racing. Just like the first the Fast and the Furious. That's what I loved about this movie! This movie Is By far the best out of the series! It would be a blessing if they created a sequel! 10/10 it would be a big hit!",bryanmelendez,2015-04-12,2015
7.0,Moving it to Japan made it worthwhile for me,"OK I'll concede it wasn't quite as good as the first two, but I still enjoyed this film. I felt that moving the location to Japan and introducing a new style of racing made a decent job of making the movie fresh.If it had just been another American coastal city (LA or Miami) with a bunch of regular drag races with some of the same people as the other two, it would have been a boring movie. But by having cute little Japanese girls wearing the skimpy outfits this time around, and featuring the beautiful backdrop of Tokyo (for some of the scenes anyway), and by using a fresh and totally new cast, I felt it made the movie worth one viewing.Plus I liked the cars as much or better than the cars of the first two films. The 460 HP twin turbo Nissan 350Z was an awesome machine for DK to drive in the film. I really loved the modified RX-7 with Han. Even the RX-8 was nice to look at, almost as nice to look at as the driver Neela. A lot of people made a beef about putting a Skyline engine in the old '67 Mustang, but at the same time, every single car in the film and in the street/drift racing scene has 95% of the original body/engine parts removed and/or replaced anyway, so what's the big deal with giving it a different engine? This isn't' the greatest movie ever made. But if you just want a nice 95 minute cheap thrill ride while looking at cute girls cheering on the guys driving their $60,000 turbocharged rides, it's solid entertainment.",ccaudle,2006-07-03,2006

6.0,"Easily the weakest entry in the series but, that isn't a bad thing.","Tokyo Drift will definitely turn heads for people. None of the original cast members, Paul Walker and Vin Diesel appear in this movie (apart from a 5 second cameo) near the credits. The main protagonist of this movie is Lucas Black. He is a completely unlikable character with juvenile behavior, performing poorly in school (on purpose I may add) and has a raspy, grating redneck voice. When a near fatal crash (almost) kills him, his mother has decided that enough is enough and that he sends his son to Japan to mature over what he has done. Lucas manages to get himself involved with the drag racing scene in Japan and toss in some miscasting with rapper Bow Wow as the token black character of the movie, you have a movie with some thrills, although it's nothing seriously worth glazing over. The ending of the movie is admittedly very well thought out and saves the whole presentation from being a disaster. Cars flip over and drifting seems to play more of a pivotal role in this movie than in other F&F movies and that actually makes watching it more fun, the camera man changing angles (in dramatic fashion) every few seconds is fun to watch. In all, this is probably the weakest entry in the franchise but, that isn't a bad thing. I can live without Lucas Black in the spotlight though.",prestonwardcondra,2015-09-05,2015

The entire movie is set in Tokyo, Japan, which also offers a very different angle as did the previous two movies.This movie isn't an 'out of the world' classic, but it's extremely enjoyable, and will keep you hooked.

6.0,pretty decent movie,"I enjoyed this movie, it was alright and had some great moments. I don't think it was the best out of the series but it was still pretty good. I enjoyed the first 2 movies more because the plot seemed better and more realistic, it was also more entertaining.Tokyo Drift is a fun and entertaining movie but it can be somewhat boring at times. Unlike 2 fast 2 furious, this movie has no jokes and is much more serious. That kind of ruins the movie. Also, Lucas Black (Shawn Boswell) acts weird. He has very little expression and personality, he annoys me a little, and his smile is so fake. DK is also annoys me. Its because he's Asian. If this movie was films somewhere else other than Tokyo, I would have liked it more and this movie probably would have been better. I just don't like asians(not in a racist way). The acting is kinda shaky. And its cheesy how Shawn is the only white guy in the school, and Bow Wow (Twinkie) being the only black guy.The things that were great about this movie is the drift racing and the racing scenes. Thats one thing that was better than 2 fast 2 furious. Drift Racing seems cool. I also like the part near the end when Shawn decides to race DK throw that mountain path, that was sick how at the end he actually won the race. It seemed so fake how Shawn won the race because he just started learning about Drift Racing wile DK was a pro. I also like the scenes at the very end when Vin Diesel makes his cameo appearances in this movie..that was tight.great movie with its ups and downs. Go watch it!",Floated2,2008-11-22,2008
5.0,the fast and the furious Tokyo drift,"i saw the fast and the furious. the movie is not really as great as it is supposed to be. The main character, sounds like Cletus, the slack jawed yokel. There are moments in the movie where the director intends some scenes to be very powerful and emotional but the performances, given by the actors are mediocre and average at best. Unless you are total rev - head fan and would like to sit through all the unconvincing performances for nearly two hours just to see the cars, then this is the movie for you. if you are someone who likes to actively engage with the story, forget this movie and save your money. The other thing that is wrong with this movie is that they cast bow wow as the sidekick. he is just as bad as the will smith and the martin Lawrence partnership in bad boys 2. the one notable exception are the two characters, drift king and Han - who serves as a mentor for our friend. who incidentally looks like he has been hit with a shovel",pinapati2,2006-06-19,2006

5.0,Only see this if you love cars,"I've seen the previous movies in the Fast and Furious series but I can't say that I remember them very well. To be honest my memory of The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is beginning to get a bit hazy as well despite the fact that it was only about a week ago I saw it. I don't think anyone is expecting this sort of movie to deliver any notable story or message so I can't really understand why the filmmakers decided to try anyhow; the result is just stupid and annoying. If you on the other hand can disregard all the scenes where Sean Boswell (Black) gets philosophical/serious/thoughtful and just enjoy all the impressive car-based action then you're in for quite a ride (pun intended, perhaps not delivered). The sad truth is that even the car action is quite stupid at times. I mean, how often does the Yakuza accept a drift race down a mountain as an appropriate means of settling a feud? I would guess not very often. And no matter what this film wants you to believe; it's not faster to drive sideways. If you want to escape from someone in a car chase, drive straight ahead instead of swerving in and out between cars. As a muscle car fan I found it a bit depressing to see that the film featured very few American cars and although our daring hero drives his fathers Mustang (what a surprise!) in the final race, it's still a Nissan V6 under the hood. Which is no good. The biggest problem with Tokyo Drift is that it tries to hard to be more than what it should be -- and what anyone expects it to be -- which only means that it gets boring at times for those of us that enjoy cars and boring all the time for everyone else. See it only if you enjoy cars, preferably Japanese ones. The rest of you should be quite cautious.",martine-12,2006-08-09,2006

3.0,Horrible plot and dialogue,"I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this movie had a rating 3.9, but I saw it last night and I say it was well deserved. It quite possibly has the dumbest plot I've ever seen, I think a grade 6 could have come up with a better plot. The plot is so basic, the main character experiences a whole new concept to racing, he sucks at it and then finds a mentor who *gasps* is not as good as the antagonist, but still pretty good, and then teaches him the ways of Drifting and then of course, the mentor can only guide the hero, but not actually be there whether because he dies/is wounded BECAUSE of the antagonist. Then the hero goes to avenge his mentor and wins where his mentor could not. Holy crap I was suspended the whole time. Also another thing that gripes me was the stupidest reasons they come up to race. ‘How should we settle this because I wanna lay the smack down on yo ass for talking trash/dishonoring me/talking to my gf/LIKING THIS MOVIE’ ‘Let's race’ This kinda crap gets regurgitated 3-4x throughout the movie 'nuff said. And another thing, it's hard to take the movie seriously when the main Protagonist sounds like the biggest douche ever, if there was ever a ‘Douche of the Year Award’, Lucas Black definitely deserves it. He sounds like Forrest Gump, except that was a decent movie. Seriously, the whole time I was expecting him to say ‘Life is like a box of chocolate, you never know what you're gonna get’ As a final note, unless you are wondering how to screw up a movie so badly where the movie involve cars, hot girls, and Yakuzas with a production budget of millions of dollars then watch this movie, otherwise I think you are better off doing whatever the hell you were doing before reading this review.",MaxX089,2006-06-24,2006
6.0,"Plot wise, not much of a movie, but at least a fun ride!","If you are looking for a heavy plot oriented movie, this is definitely not what your looking for. The plot seems to drift off most of the times, with kind of a sloppy script, even though thats not what most people, including me look for in the Fast And Furious franchise. So does it deliver with fun, thrilling, non stop racing? Yes, and in many ways it stands out as disconnected from all of the other movies in this franchise, for better or worse. Trying to pass Lucas Black of as a 17 year old teenager was kind of laughable. To enjoy this movie you have to leave all sense of realism at the door, because like in a every other FNF movie, the crashes are stupidly unrealistic. This movie provides a very memorable, and possibly my favourite character in, Han who is always munching on some snacks! Bow wow is kind of funny, although the lack of Paul Walker in this movies, really brings it down. Ultimately this movie greatly benefits from its setting in Tokyo which is a great change of scenery for the movie, and exhilarating racing scenes. This movie seems to get unnecessary hate in my opinion, even without Paul Walker, Vin Diesel etc, it isn't any more silly/ or glaring bad then the previous ones.

1.0,The neurons escape 2 fast,"Infumible garbage, a full-blown torture and a shame in every scene. The third part of this franchise is one of the worst movies you can suffer. Do you know those simple stories of embarrassing script that were the previous ?, because this is not even simple. There is no story, there is nothing.The thing can be tried to explain in this: a Lucas Black trying to sneak as a 17-year-old boy, gets trouble in car races. Instead of going to the jail or the juvie, he goes to Japan, where his father lives, and in their class they're all in the races, where you give him a car because he has the money, and when he breaks it, he gives him another one. There are more races and another guy who also has money left gives him wads of bills to continue trying to kill himself. His biggest rival is another kid with fantasies of greatness who, well, likes the same girl as him. All this dense and intelligent plot will settle with a race in which the winner takes the girl as a trophy. Is the same history of ""Karate Kid 2"" 20 years after (KK2 was in 1986), this time with tuned cars.And that's it, that's all. Really, there's nothing else, that's the movie. It is even surprising that you can make good the previous two.The races ?, can not be described as action scenes, are over the top of a higher level, with cars making impossible drifts thanks to a sultry CGI.What's the moral? For men: don't study, don't be smart, don't strive, don't work, life will give you everything done, money will rain from the sky, you will always be surrounded by good girls, drinking champagne for the day while playing Ludo with the baddies of your friends, and destroying $ 20000 cars up in the evenings. For women: don't study, don't be smart, don't strive, don't work, just go to the prototype man described above, you can always be the trophy with which will remain the most pouch of all; a good girl who pleases the macho men.Vomiting.",stormhawk2021,2017-07-14,2017
10.0,The best among the three,"I just saw this film last Friday. This movie made my contact lens dry for not blinking my eyes because it was just thrilling and a little exciting. It has got the best stunts, the background music really suited in this movie. For me, this is the best the fast and the furious have ever made so far. Lucas Black's character as Sean is good for him. It made him look hot. He had to go in Japan to not be in the jail. Though he's forbidden to race he's still do it, thanks to Twinkie he showed a little world of best cars to Sean. I like the car of Twinkie here, cool, huh? Anyway, it reminds me the Japanese Anime Initial D because they both just pretty alike, Sean reminds me the main protagonist Takumi and Sean's father reminds me the father of Takumi. I like Sean here, he's very well-determined and practice for him makes him perfect to drift. This movie is good for the car lovers, if you want to drift, think first what would be may happen to you.",Erollynx,2006-07-01,2006
6.0,"Beautiful Tokyo setting, and awesome racing!","Review: As with the second movie, this movie is more of a stand-alone feature, and not a direct follow-up to the Fast and The Furious 2001. However the story is good as are the two leads in this movie. The script could have used work though. Takeaways: -Director justin Lin does a good job with the visuals and the action and racing scenes. No wonder the Fast producers asked him to come back to direct the sequels. -Lucas black was believable as trouble young street racer Sean, who is sent to live with his navy father in Tokyo by his mother to stay out of trouble. He befriends Street Racer/gangster Han Lue, who teaches him how to drift. I like this character, but he is a hot-head. -Later on Lucas Black would star in 6 seasons of NCIS New Orleans as Agent Chris Lasalle. -Sung Kang was great as Han Lue. I love how this drifter is edgy yet kind. We didn't know that So much hurt happened to him before this (explored in the other fast movies when he lost his girlfriend) -Bow Wow (Aka Shad Moss) plays Sean's friend and sidekick as they race against the gangsters in the end. -The Cars are beautiful and of course the racing was intense. -Hey was that Brad Taylor (Zach Tyler Bryan) for home improvement? -The script could have been a little better. Some scenes and dialogue I just cringed at. -I loved the ending scene with.... VIN DIESEL!!!! DOM TORRETTO IS BACK!!! WHOOOO!!! Also be sure to watch Furious 7 after this because it shows a lot more of Han's death and that a man who wanted revenge was responsible.",myblueblazer,2023-05-29,2023
1.0,Don't waste your time,"I was really un-impressed with this film. It was corny and boring. Also this isn't just my view; The much acclaimed movie site www.rotttontomatoes.com gave it 36%""Unlike the campy 2001 Vin Diesel vehicle that started it all, what's missing in this third incarnation is any sense of fun, overrun by the forced seriousness of a soap opera mistaking itself for serious drama."" - Steven Snyder Newark Star-Ledger""For all its crashes and flash, this is a movie that drifts away as we watch it. Muscle cars and all, it's often a waste of gas."" - Michael Wilmington Chicago TribuneHopefully this will help others see the light ;o There are actual good movies out there and this definitely is not one of them.",spira-3,2006-09-20,2006
8.0,One of the best movies of the franchise,"I don't know why this movie is rated 6/10, it's one of the best FF movies in the franchise.It has an original storyline out of all of them, great cars, great location, fab car races and quite stylish is some places - I mean it's Tokyo!The cast are also quite decent, I liked Lucas Black, who doesn't play a typical FF male airhead character like Vin Diesel and even (rest in peace) Paul Walker. Plot twist, he's a teenager too. Han is great, the gf and the villain/yakuza storyline.All later movies have just become unoriginal, car racing movies with dumb stunts tbh. I'll still watch them, as I always loved the first movie when it came out.But number 3 has held up quite well. Even in 2021.",indiana1981,2021-03-27,2021
6.0,It's about time..,"When I first watched The Fast and The Furious in 2001. I thought a sequel to it would surely screw up. Sure enough, 2F2F came out, and I was right. I first thought, a third movie would completely ruin the franchise..Oh how wrong I am. This movie is jam packed with action from start to finish, and has little comedic moments thrown in. I was on the edge of my seat, and was shaking. At the last race, and at the end, my heart was beating like crazy. Tokyo Drift is the only TFTF movie that actually captured the import scene correctly. The first two were too Hollywood. This one has a new face, Sean Boswell(Played by Lucas Black), and he doesn't disappoint. When hes caught for destroying property, and street racing, he is sent to Tokyo, Japan to live with his father, who was in the military. He meets Twinkie(Played by Bow Wow) who links him into the world of underground racing, where a new form of racing called drifting (think of it as, turning..with style). Overall. I give The Fast and The Furious:Tokyo Drift a total of 10 out of 10. It made my heart beat, pulled me to the edge of my seat, and never bored me. Justin Lin is a king.",Raj9096,2006-06-22,2006
5.0,see it if you must but only if you must - POSSIBLE SPOILERS," I saw this at a sneak preview. If you like adrenalin fueled racing sequences, this movie is for you. If you like a movie with terrific dialogue, great performances, and social responsibility, skip it. most of the dialogue seemed to be taken from junior high school blogs on myspace - 'you and me are alike' - 'you have to find your place in the world' - these aren't exact quotes, but you get the general drift. In the first two FAF's, we had undercover cops working to right wrongs. In this one, it's simply a kid with angst and then lots of kids in Japan with angst and they get out their angst by racing and wrecking hot expensive cars through the streets of Tokyo with absolutely no regard for anyone else on the road or pedestrians or destruction of property or threatening the lives of bystanders. I fear we will have a repeat of reckless driving as was inspired by the first two FAF's. this movie was worth the price of admission, which for me was nothing since it was a free preview.",u2bme102,2006-06-14,2006

6.0,Roppongi Vice.,"Honestly, I think this is the only film in the F&F series that I hadn't seen prior to this little burst of rewatches I've been doing around ""Fast X"". I wasn't looking forward to it, as it's the lowest rated film in the series, but I found it to be pretty watchable stuff.Having been involved in an accident whilst racing, Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) is sent to live with his father (Brian Goodman) in Tokyo. He struggles to fit in but makes a friend in fellow American Twinkie (Bow Wow) who introduces him to the local street racing scene. The enigmatic Han (Sung Kang) offers Sean the chance to drive his car but, unfamiliar with the drifting technique, he crashes it. Indebted to Han, Sean starts to work off his obligation, but Han's friends, particularly Takashi (Brian Tee) who has Yakuza connections, take a strong dislike to him.So, whilst 'good' is still probably a step or two beyond it, I did, as I say, find the film the be pretty watchable stuff. It's again even more low key than the original film, let alone the way the many sequels have gone. Though there's a tangential link to the Yakuza there isn't even really that much crime in this film, (ignoring the one murder for a moment) it is literally just about street racing and for not much more than pride and status. Black is alright in the lead role, but there's definitely a reason that Han would be the character to recur more often in the series going forward, even though it would require not one, but two retcon's of his death for it to really make sense (such as it does). The film also has the legendary Sonny Chiba appear as Takashi's Yakuza uncle.Even though it's missing the sorts of stunts that the series is now famous for I didn't mind my time with Tokyo Drift and whilst I can't imagine rushing back to it again anytime soon, It was a reasonable time.",southdavid,2023-06-10,2023
7.0,It's either you like it or hate it.,"Despite its flaws, I'm still enjoyed Tokyo Drift to this day and it is still one of my personal favourites from this franchise. This movie felt like it rather take it easy and simple, but sometimes, simplicity worked better than being convoluted most of the time. The action sequences are a lot better than before, especially the last race segment. There's fair share amount of hot babes, if that's one of the the things you expect from this movie, and the score are probably the best in the franchise, in my opinion. Some of the characters are one-dimensional and stereotypical though, especially the MC, the script is predictable and felt familiar at times, and the fact that this sequel is almost completely different from the other entries might throw people off.",rimuruu,2023-01-16,2023
4.0,this movie sucks,"OK, not only does it not make sense, the story is just stupid and boring.I watched the whole thing without sleeping only because I kept waiting for some good car action ... but it never came.Oh, and they smash up almost every car. It almost made me cry tears of rage ... such a waste of nice cars (not that you really get to see what they are anyway).They should've just focused on the cars.... Instead they tried a story as well and blew the whole movie. Nothing in it was enjoyable.At first I saw Bow Wow was in the movie. So naturally I thought ... dam Bow Wow is a great rapper, so this should help the movie. Instead, his character is a criminal loser, with the most stupid ride I've ever seen.Then the opening scene with the usual college kids trying to be baddass and the *good strong kid* against them. Dam ... he was supposed to be a hero but instead he gets owned ... and this is the main character I'm talking about.So then I thought, wow, so maybe he gets off to a slow start and he starts showing some skills in Tokyo. Nope. He just goes from one stuff-up to the next. And someone always ends up giving him something else to stuff up and the movie goes on and on. The whole way through I'm in disbelief and trying to keep myself from falling asleep by thinking that he will finally show some skills and own up the bad guys.Then that moment comes and he wins ... but its such an anti-climax. Not sure why. I think its because I never really saw any good skills. Or maybe its cos there was no point to the win. Or maybe its because I never really got a sense of the racing. Or maybe its because their race 'tactics' involve smashing into the opponents car. Dunno.",joshuabeattie1,2006-06-28,2006
10.0,This Sequel still Brings it!,"After I have seen and heard awful reviews, this movie was quite a surprised to me. Sure it does not feature Paul Walker or Vin Disel!? Lucas Black did a good job filled in to the main role. As we all know, Street racing and customized street car with unique painting originated in Japan, and I thought it was brilliant idea that this movie took a place in Japan. Sure it has a quite a few flows as American kid never ended up going to Japanese traditional public school. And Lucas Black's military dad never had to live in that pig stay. They do have a nice western houses for them to live either on base or near base, but never lived downtown area where 30 miles off from base... The drive sequels are great as first two movies in different way. It was such a treat to see them on street of Tokyo. And Those unknown Asian actors contributed quite a depth of characters to make this eyecady/popcorn movie more realistic. It still amazes me that The Fast and Furious movies always have been meant to guilty pleasure/pop corn movies, but it always has great and strong character developments and cultural portraits.",ballplayer270000,2008-12-25,2008
7.0,"It was a great movie, And, i'm just a girl!","Initially, I was dragged into this movie to see it with my boyfriend. It was a deal we had made. I saw one of the movies he wanted to see, and he saw one of my ""chick flicks."" I generally think that if there is a really good movie. They should make a second part TOPS. They tend to get boring after awhile. Also, I just thought, if this movie has entirely different actors, than why are they making it, at all? ANd plus, BOW WOW, of all people was in it. Whenever I think of him, he's a little boy in dreads trying to be a lot older than he should.So, the first hour seemed a little cliché. Slutty girl, ""greasy mechanic"" that's the badass of the car nation"" and the jock. The subject of why they have a RACE in the first place was cliché, it seemed like a girl movie all of it's own. ""COmpete for me, blah blah blah."" But then, it got more interesting. The son moves to Japan, sees some good looking girls, and than, comfortably, they incorporate racing.Well, I won't give it away. But, needless to say, I A GIRL liked this movie. Although dull at few parts, trying to add in some extra emotion while not needed to soften up the rough spots, I was very satisfied.If you like cars, racing, beautiful women, (Nathalie Kelley is stunning bringing the hot school girl routine OVER THE TOP)and you can stand an accent for two hours, go see it. I LOVED IT (Please, do not attempt the nifty car moves after seeing this movie. My boyfriend wanted to drift home...)",madamesamarell,2006-07-12,2006
2.0,Waste of time,"The film is really very weak. It's a shame because the other two, even though not my usual cup of tea had something to them...especially the first. Yet Tokyo Drift just doesn't have anything! We start in an awful car race scene in America which yes does have some moments of impressive special effects but one can't help but say ‘haven't we seen this before’! The rest of the film, set in Tokyo, just rambles on as if the director added the next scene simply to get to the final, climactic scene on the mountain. Before we know it our protagonist has fallen in love, his friend has been shot and he somehow manages to drive some amazing cars despite being in debt, foreign and only 17!! The final scene I also think is weak, the obvious flaws I suppose can be forgiven but just the repetition and unlikely car sequences are too much to bare! In conclusion the only good thing about the film is the surprising entry of Vin Diesel in the last four seconds of the film. The dialogue, casting, screenplay, directing and acting are all way below par.",peter_kent2409,2007-12-17,2007
8.0,Surprisingly good for the third in a series,"I had heard some rather negative reviews of this movie before I saw it and really expected it to be somewhat lame as Hollywood these days seems incapable of producing a series where each film can stand on it's own merit, rather milking a dead cow more often or not and producing sequels that tend to be worse than the film that preceded it.I was pleasantly surprised, however, with the overall flow and energy of this film. Very difficult to find fault with the special effects, the acting was not terrible and the relatively exotic setting made this movie good enough to stand alone from the other two.If you are a fan of either of the first two or movies about ultra fast (and expensive) cars in general Tokyo Drift is a must-see.",extremecs,2006-11-04,2006
6.0,Give it a chance...,I'm giving this a 10 because it was SO MUCH BETTER than I thought it would be. I didn't think I could get past Lucas Black's heavy accent. He toned it down to a believable one that didn't get in the way of the story.This film moves quickly and doesn't stray too long on dialog and kissy-face. (Was there any?) The folks that gave this movie a 1 out of 10 obviously didn't see and don't like the franchise and feel that they can bash a movie in 10 lines or more and feel better about it. Those people should just go watch South Park and stop whining. This movie is entertainment in the purest form. I will see it again in the theaters soon.,wilkinsd-1,2006-06-19,2006
3.0,"The Fast, the Furious and the Indifferent","What's to say. The new chapter of The Fast And The Furious series is a major disappointment.The good: Great races, beautiful cars, a beautiful picturing of Tokyo.The bad: Too few races (3-4), too much talk, embarrassing script, even more embarrassing acting and the most DUMB DUMB DUMB dialogue seen in years. Lucas Black acts like he never had stood in front of a camera before (he looks like a wounded bird), and when he talks, his voice control is dull and indolent. Who should watch this? People with hangovers, who wants no-brainer entertainment (like I did the other day, and therefore rent TOKYO DRIFT) and likes fast cars, races (the ones we get)",Austin_Powers-1,2007-04-22,2007
6.0,Probably the best entry in the franchise so far.,"Tokyo Drift feels like it's actually trying to be a normal film. There's barely any horrible CGI and the driving stunts are more impressive than ever.I remember a lot of the audience at the time being annoyed that Vin wasn't the main character. I couldn't care less. Sean is a decent protagonist and Han is the most interesting side character so far.The setting is the most interesting part, they manage to sell it as Tokyo pretty well and there's a great chase sequence in the streets.When it comes to the writing, the dialogue is laughable at times, and the tropes of the franchise are very prevalent in this one.However, the worst part about the film's story is that the writers for later films want us to believe this entry takes place in 2014. Ah, 2014, the age of flip phones and 2006 music. Yeah, nice work guys.At least it's a big step up from 2 Fast 2 Furious.

Fast and furious new model original parts is also better. Fast five is also better. Fast and Furious 6 is also better. Furious 7 is also better. But still this movie has a great story line. It also has great acting. See it. It is one of the best action movies from 2006. This is a lot better then V for vendetta that movie stinks. But this movie is so mush better. It is very fast past. See this movie. It is a great movie. You need to see this movie. If you like action movies you like this movie. I is awesome. See it. It is a great movie. A lot of action. You need to see it.

1.0,"I never thought It was going to get a worse than ""2 Fast 2 Furious"".","But from the start, it set off things with one of the worst casting ever. All the characters look super old, not even close to teenagers. Besides that, the acting and dialogue is even worse than before. Was this on purpose to make Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson look like better actors?First scene: a woman just offers herself up as a prize for a race between her boyfriend and our protagonist. Excuse me? ""I thought you loved me"", she says when the race is about the finish and it is close. WHAT?After that pathetic start, nothing gets better, which is really a hard thing to do. The plot is stupid, as the poorly presented ""troublemaker teen"" is sent to Japan with his father... only to remain the same and fall for a ""girl that he can't have"". That's it. That's the story. There are idiotic actions and reactions, that ends up involving Yakuzas(!) and cars, to the fact he likes a girl (and she likes him back for no reason other than he's a white American in Japan. Apparently the producers didn't realize Black is not Paul Walker), but they don't really add anything interesting.Absolutely atrocious.",educallejero,2019-03-25,2019
9.0,Absolutely Awesome,"If you liked either of the previous Fast and Furious movies, see this movie. If you like cars, see this movie. If you like hot girls, see this movie. I'll grant that the plot isn't super intensive, but the mix of plot intertwined with action was great. I think that the 2 Fast 2 Furious plot of 'cops and drugs' has been used a little too much, and yet that movie still had redeeming features. I don't know why there is so many people who think it wasn't worth the money. Lets face it. There are VERY few movies that have: great plots, Awesome action, and very hot chicks. I watch movies a lot and i have only seen - at most - 5 movies that have the above content. It also depends on the viewer and their preferences. If your confused about whether you want to see Tokyo Drift or not, my advice is to ignore what anybody says about it and to just go and watch it for yourself and decide whether it was or wasn't worth it.",mutated_carcass,2006-06-18,2006
6.0,"Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift - Drifting, Clichés, and a Crash Course in Japanese","Sean Boswell, the undisputed king of crashing for no reason, gets shipped off to Japan like a faulty Amazon return. The guy arrives in Tokyo with all the finesse of an American tourist in socks and sandals. His mission? Lay low. What does he do instead? Finds the underground drifting scene and immediately forgets about staying out of trouble. It's like giving a GTA player a car and expecting them to follow traffic laws.Lucas Black as Sean is that guy from your high school who thinks he's cool because he can do donuts in the parking lot, but everyone knows he's one mistake away from wrapping his car around a tree. He tries to be the main character, but let's be real: his charisma is about as strong as a dying car battery. Han Lue, the real MVP, effortlessly steals the spotlight. Whenever Han's on screen, Sean might as well be a turn signal nobody's using.Justin Lin knows how to shoot Tokyo at night-neon lights, shadowy alleys, and a constant sense of danger lurking around every corner. But the most glowing thing here isn't the city or the cars-it's the clichés. We get it all: a bargain-bin romance, neighborhood rivalries, and women circling cars like they're waiting for a discount fashion shoot. Honestly, Mario Kart has more emotional depth.Where the film really shines is on the asphalt. The drifting scenes are filmed with so much care you can practically smell the burnt rubber. Justin Lin shows Michael Bay that you don't need a thousand explosions to create adrenaline-pumping action. The drifts are tight, the engines roar, and you're glued to your seat. But let's be clear: even the best car chases can't save a plot that barely fills a sticky note.As for the villain, DK (Drift King-seriously, who approved this?), he's a walking stereotype. The guy squints menacingly like he's either plotting Sean's downfall or struggling to read small text. The yakuza subplot? As threatening as overcooked sushi. You're never actually worried about Sean, because the whole thing is as predictable as sunrise.Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift is like grabbing McDonald's at 3 a.m.: you know it won't provide much substance, but it hits the spot for now. The drifting scenes are spectacular, but everything around them is as flat as a tire with a nail in it. Watch it once, appreciate Han's chill dominance, and forget the rest.",OniFR,2025-02-05,2025
3.0,The plot is running on fumes,"Yes, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift has some cool driving in it, but the plot is running on fumes and the actors need to be flushed.

I can't believe they actually had my middle name and surname in the movie and I actually love driving fast and pretty furious. Back to the point, great soundtrack to an awesome speed movie... great special effects...great action scenes, hot honeyz... Lucas Black did great playing this role, not too ""Mega Star"" and pulled it off good. He was better in Friday Night Lights with Billy Bob Thornton... And daaaaaaang...the chicky babe in there, where has she been all this while? She has been in a few small pictures but this should hopefully help her get on to bigger screen movies. The Japanese guys did good and Yakuza play was pretty good. One of the awesome scenes was when the DRIFTED and avoided like a bizillion people around Shibuya Square in Tokyo. For those who don't know, it's busier than any of New York's intersections! I don't think I've seen that kinda rush in Shanghai during rush hour. That's 16 million people in the city alone!

7.0,Stupid but fun; probably unintentionally.,"While this is one of the stupidest movies ever, it was fun to watch. We ended up regularly laughing with/at the movie and everybody in my group who went to see it said they enjoyed it. When you combined this with the fact that it had some gorgeous women, it was a surprisingly fun movie. Even if you are not up to the Herculean task of suspending disbelief when watching this movie, it can be ""fun"". However, it is not, however, a ""good"" movie. While the adults playing teenagers do not even look the part, the character motivations are incomprehensible, the dialog is puerile, and many of the vehicular stunts are far-fetched, the movie is inexplicably fun to watch (with a group).",garretsr,2006-07-05,2006
5.0,like a book amongst the many on the shelf,"The Fast and the Furious,first movie, was okay. I'm not a big VD fan.Too Fast Too Furious was surprisingly very entertaining. Both Walker and his co-star did a good job. With Tokyo Drift, Walker is gone and in comes 24 year old, Lucas Black with Bow Wow (Mr. yawn-fest) The first fifteen or so minutes of this film are wild. Sean(the lead) is sent to Tokyo so that he can avoid himself getting into trouble. In Tokyo, he meets Bow Wow and they become good friends quickly to get the story to move along. Of course, there is a girl in it but never mind, just imagine a movie based on semi-entertaining drifts and soppy story lines and somewhat cheesy characters.This is not a bad film. It's just that I expected them to raise the bar. The soundtrack is decent and the music will make you tap your feet while you sit in the theater.Overall, I'd say the film is watchable if you do not expect very good actions. The villain could have been made to look cooler than what they did make him look like. The Japanese should love this film. Not the best camera-work in the film though. The sets are below average for an action packed film of this genre.Anyhow, watch it if you must. I would watch it if I read my own review for it's worth watching. That's all.",benighted2005,2006-06-20,2006
6.0,"Still entertaining, just missing things","When franchises start with a strong footing in film, it is important to keep the elements that made the first installment just as great in every shot for each future installment that comes along. This includes direction, cinematography, action, music and characters. The writing behind the sequel should really be the only thing that changes because if the writing were the same, it would just be a rehash of previous movies in the franchise. For the most part, this sequel gets a number of the components right but there are also parts of the movie that are dislodged from the past films.Starting totally fresh with an entire new cast, viewers will follow the troubled life of Sean Boswell (Lucas Black), a Southern schoolboy who loves to drive cars to their limit. He also can't cut a break with the authorities or doing well in school. After relocating several times, Sean's mother decides to send him to his father who lives in Tokyo Japan. However, Sean still can't keep his hands off a steering wheel. He ends up befriending a classmate named Twinkie (Bow Wow), who then brings him to street race where he learns a new word called ""Drifting"" - thus the title. Along with Twinkie, Sean also meets D.K. (Brian Tee), Han (Sung Kang) and Neela (Nathalie Kelley).Character wise, none of the actors are terrible but they do lack characterization and acting skills. Lucas Black can handle a Southern accent (unless that is his real voice) but displays that smirking and frowning are his only two facial expressions. Bow Wow is just a replacement for Tyrese Gibson. Neela is supposedly Australian but slips frequently in speech. Sometimes she'll sound Australian and other times like some other ethnic group. She was the weakest of the bunch - I guess this because this is her first movie role? Brian Tee was able to pull of his role with ease for his muscular physique and gangster like image. Sung Kang is the most likable actor here. His character is smooth and easy going. In some respects, you would think he should've been in the title role.As far from the last two films have come, surprisingly, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) does have a connection. It is a very small but significant connection. Chris Morgan's writing behind this installment isn't bad when it comes down to the fleshed out action scenes but again it's the characters that suffer. It's understandable that The Fast and the Furious franchise is about the cars, but audiences have to have characters to connect to. If the cast keeps changing frequently, it's going to get really tiresome.Thankfully the one thing that keeps getting more creative are the driving sequences. In other words, the ""drifting"". If it weren't for the drifting in the action sequences, there would not have been anything new to see here. Although the racing wasn't as crazy as The Fast and the Furious (2001) and 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003), the slick driving and stylish craft of drifting really helped make the racing scenes fun. Stephen F. Windon's cinematography is able to catch a lot of the nice shots of Tokyo, which is also cool. Lastly, another composer was brought in, this time Brian Tyler. Surprisingly, Tyler's score is barely prevalent in the running time. It's not that Tyler created a bad score, it's just barely there. Perhaps the finale is when it's heard the most. Other than that, the soundtrack takes over. After the last two films, score collectors are still waiting to hear some noteworthy tunes.It's an equal match to the 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) but for different reasons. It's new hook which involves ""drifting"" is cool, some of the characters stand out and it shares a connection with the last two films before it. With it however, comes weak characterizations, average acting and little emotional attachments.",breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,2014-04-13,2014

7.0,yes the acting is bad ... it's a car movie,"I don't know why this movie got a 4.7. I saw Nacho Libre last night, and aside from a few hederian gimmicks that (embarrasingly) made me laugh, I found myself asleep by the time he ""ran to the wilderness"". Nacho wasn't just dumb ... It was 100% worse than utterly boring.""Tokyo Drift"", on the other hand, had a lot to offer. Sure it was like candy ... fast cars, danger, fire, guns, women, nice street shots of Tokyo, and Sonny Chiba as a Yakuza boss... but at least it knew what it was ... a corny car movie only out entertain. Hey, I'm a guy ... what can I say. Besides that, it's Fast and Furios for goodness sake .. what were you expecting, Bullit? Nacho just tried to hard to be some clever indie movie, and frankly all those dirty-nerdy temptations from childhood were already explored in Dynamite and are now best left hidden away in the past. Nacho tried to be something. But something it was not. And with it's cast and ""pret-indie"" (my term so y'all better give me credit) look, it wasn't even an indie flick.If I had to put the two side by side in a race, my 10 bucks would be on Tokyo Drift. It's a good movie for the big screen. Wait for Nacho to come out on video, so you ""walk out of the movie"" without feeling bad about having gone to the theater.Despite the previews, there's nothing redeeming about Jack Black flexing his buttocks in those white pants. The rest of that scene is so dumb I wanted to stick a corn cob in my eye.",kimchimofo,2006-06-19,2006
1.0,Oh My God!,"Tokyo Drift is an amazingly awful film. what the hell was the director thinking?!?! The Fast and The Furious films should have been left at 2, cause making the third was a terrible mistake!!There was no clear storyline. The protagonist was a complete arse! i couldn't stand him. he was far too cocky for his own good and his accent annoyed the hell out of me. The races sucked. I find it hard to see the point in making a film about drifting. it sucked!The acting was terrible! all of the actors sucked. the directors could have easily found much better actors for the roles. finally, i was extremely confused to find that all of the characters in the film spoke fluent English; despite being Japanese! was this just coincidence?",whayward91-1,2007-06-19,2007
9.0,Greatest Car Movie Ever!,"I gotta say this was definitely the best one in the series. The race and chase scenes were unbelievable, thanks to director Justin Lin's work. The guy really knows how to use a camera. He does some amazing shots, with almost no use of CGI. Its nice to know that you can still make a great action movie with just a few regular cameras. The story wasn't to bad either thanks to some good acting from lead Lucas Black and Sung Kang. Bow Wow wasn't too bad either, contrary to the predictions of many. And of course the cars and the women were awesome (I'm dying for a red EVO IX now!). If you wanna see a great action or car movie, this is definitely something not to be missed. *** 1/2 Stars!",rracer01,2006-06-16,2006

1.0,The WORST movie ever made,"What a disgraceful excuse for a film this is. Appalling acting, annoying characters and above all, an unbelievable storyline involving possibly the worst actor I have ever seen (Lucas Black) battling with un-convincing Japanese gangsters over some pathetic sideways race down a hill!? A totally Americanised version of Tokyo and Japanese culture and frankly a massive insult to anyone who watches it. Avoid this joke of a movie like the bubonic plague, it is complete and utter rubbish. So many plot holes and in-accuracies, it simply isn't possible to list them. Every copy of this diabolical film should be burnt in a giant bonfire. Total nonsense from start to finish, a real disgrace.",GTFC1987,2013-11-14,2013
10.0,"""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" Changes Direction, but I Love It!","I love the previous ""Fast and Furious"" films and Japan. When some guys make a film fusing ""Fast and Furious"" and Tokyo, I love it even more! Yes!The third film in the franchise is a significant shift, as this feels like a spin off instead of a sequel. As Sean (Lucas Boswell) avoids jail time back in the US and moves to Japan, he finds himself in the underworld of drifting. He meets new friends Twinkie (Bow Wow) and Han (Sung Kang), a potential love interest Neela (Nathalie Kelley), and some guys who he may mess up with.As a ""Fast and Furious"" film, expect what you expect: car sequences that you just love to watch and always thrill your soul. It's nice to see how Sean learns to drift, from crashing to stuff nearby until he finally learns the craft. I love how this film accurately captures the beauty Japan has to offer: the trees, the houses, the neon lights, the night skyline, everything! I like some romance in this movie, just the right amount of cheese. Haha! Drifting, a different way to race, is introduced in this film, so that's some addition. Some emotional scenes may get you, so watch out.Want some good thrills? Then watch this and be satisfied!",AdrianOlonan,2015-07-17,2015
6.0,One of the better movies of the franchise,"When it first came out, I was in fourth grade and knew nothing about street racing or cars in general. But my evolving fascination with automobiles led me to this franchise, and specifically to this third installment of the series. The sleek cars and high-speed chases intrigued me, and it opened up a whole new world.Yes, you heard it right. Tokyo Drift was the first Fast & Furious movie I saw on television, thanks to a DVD disc I randomly came across.Seventeen long years have passed, and my perceptions of the series as well as cinema as a whole have changed considerably, but upon revisiting, I realised I still adore this movie, primarily because it stayed true to the central theme, which was racing. Unlike other movies in this series, where varied storylines frequently come to the fore, things have been kept fairly simple here.The fact that they prioritised ""Racing"" over everything else was something I really liked, despite the film's own share of problems. Therefore, it has always been one of the better entries in the F&F franchise for me.",SoumikBanerjee1996,2023-06-10,2023
3.0,doesn't really differ from poor previous installments,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is the third installment of a series that is focused on racing and fancy cars. The film is mostly aimed at young men who expect impressive races, cool cars, simple plot, not sophisticated dialogue and lots of hot chicks. I can say that they shouldn't be disappointed as the film delivers all these requirements. Nonetheless, other viewers won't certainly like this movie because it, in fact, doesn't really differ from its poor predecessors. As one might have expected, the flick is filled with clichés and creators are not interested in widening the well-known formula of action pic. Characters are stereotypical and one-dimensional. The movie is incredibly pretentious as well as lacks any logic. You could have expected that as well. There is also huge casting mistake. Namely, our hero looks at least 8 years older. Seriously, is there anybody who believes he's 18 ? I have serious doubts. Among sparse virtues one may rate fast editing and decent cinematography. To summarize, the target audience will be pleased, others should skip the screening of this film.",manicman84,2006-09-23,2006

6.0,Could do with some polishing.,"I'll say the first thing that came to mind when I was going to offer my comments/reviews on this film: The first two were obviously better. Mainly because the story lines were thought about carefully. FF3 was to me, absolute rubbish in certain parts of the film. But I think I thoroughly enjoyed most of the action with the cars and because I love Japan, it was nice to see great views of it from every aspect. (From city night life to the school life) As much as I also enjoyed see a certain someone at the very end, it actually made the ending quite pathetic. I saw no logic behind it.But nonetheless, I enjoyed this film but I'm still deciding as to whether or not I should purchase the DVD. Soundtrack is a definite must though.",vanessa-jane-c,2006-07-04,2006
6.0,"Upon the fourth viewing of this film, i realized............","This is actually a highly underrated movie. However, in order to realize this, you have to first look beyond the surface- which in essence is a 90 minute long music video. So once you've pulled that off, you can see that this is perhaps the most well made one of the franchise. Yes, it does have sub-par acting for a majority of the movie, but you don't watch these for the acting, you watch them for the cars- and it delivers in that aspect. And yes, Lucas Black's hick accent does come on a bit strong, but I later realized it helps add to the fish out of water motif throughout the movie. As I mentioned before; this is a well made film, especially in the way Justin Lin captured elements of it: it keeps your attention with eye-catching visuals, fast cars, and a wonderfully tone-setting score composed by Brian Tyler. Also, unlike the first two films in the franchise, I find this one to be highly rewatchable. So lets face the facts and view the movie for what it really is: 90 minuets of fast, furious fun.",MovieDude12,2009-11-16,2009
1.0,Forgettable,"How can I describe The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift in one word? I would have to say ""forgettable."" I'm a huge fan of the Fast and the Furious movies. I think they're awesome. I watched Tokyo Drift once on TV. I wasn't impressed. After having loved The Fast and the Furious and 2 Fast 2 Furious, I hated Tokyo Drift. After that, I really had no interest to see Tokyo Drift again. But I saw it a second time only because I was hanging out with friends and one of the guys turned it on. I didn't leave. I watched it and decided to see if it would be better a second time around. The opening to Tokyo Drift really wasn't anything special. The race was nothing great. Especially when you compare it to the first impressive race they had to start off 2 Fast 2 Furious. The protagonist we are introduced to is Sean Boswell, but there is really no immediate reason to really like him. I also guessed from the beginning of the movie that the soundtrack was going to be terrible. And oh boy was I right. This movie had one of the lamest soundtracks ever. The storyline to the movie isn't really that original or interesting. It's basically Karate Kid and Karate Kid Part II, only with racing. The writers were clearly inspired by those movies instead of the previous Fast and the Furious movies when they wrote this. There's the new guy moving to a new place and starting at a new school. He meets a girl he likes, the girl has a mean boyfriend. The mean boyfriend and main villain of the movie is D.K. D.K is a cross between Johnny Lawrence from Karate Kid and Chozen from Karate Kid Part II. Only unlike Johnny, instead of kicking the protagonist's ass and humiliating him with karate, D.K. does it in a race. Sean, our very dull hero, realizes that racing in Tokyo is a hell of a lot different. It's a different kind of racing called drifting. He is taken under someone's wing and trains. D.K., like Chozen, gives our hero a beating, gets dishonored in the movie, and even has a powerful uncle that he respects and fears. There was one interesting idea in the whole movie and that was the new way of racing. They decided to try something new with the drifting. Personally, I prefer the good old street racing from The Fast and the Furious and 2 Fast 2 Furious. But hey, they wanted to try something new with Tokyo Drift. Unfortunately, the other new things just didn't cut it. The cast of Tokyo Drift was nowhere near as good as the solid casts they had in the other Fast and the Furious movies. The villain in Tokyo Drift is a weak villain, the love interest, Nathalie Kelley was nothing special, Sung Kang was nothing special, and Bow Wow just wasn't a good casting choice. Seriously, Bow Wow? Finally, I have to get to the star of the movie, Lucas Black. Lucas Black couldn't top Paul Walker or Vin Diesel. I didn't think he was going to. How could anyone? But he was just a terrible leading man. He was dull and boring and had zero charisma. Paul Walker and Vin Diesel are certainly not dull or boring. And they both have charisma. They were able to use that charisma to make you cheer them on and root for them as you watched the movie. I don't know what they were thinking when they cast Lucas Black to play the hero. I saw this movie twice and both times were out of curiosity. The first time, I wondered what it was. The second time, I wondered if I'd like it more. The movie didn't come through. To all of you Fast and the Furious fans out there that absolutely love this franchise, skip Tokyo drift and go straight to Fast and Furious. It featured Paul Walker and Vin Diesel and that was the way it started and should have stayed. Okay, 2 Fast 2 Furious didn't have Vin Diesel. But Paul Walker did great carrying the movie and Tyrese was just fine. Tokyo Drift had no one to carry the movie or save the movie. Seeing the Fast and the Furious movies that followed Tokyo Drift only make you realize more how bad Tokyo Drift really was. If you decided to start a Fast and the Furious collection, great. But I'd leave Tokyo Drift out and focus on the other movies that have everything you could want in a movie. We definitely could have done without Tokyo Drift. It's a shame they decided to tie it in to the rest of the movies because it was unnecessary. We also could've done without Sun Kang's character Han. And just in case you're wondering, Lucas Black wasn't used for the rest of the movies. He only showed up once and for a minute in Furious 7 to help tie in Tokyo Drift. The dull Lucas Black and his character are, like Tokyo Drift, forgettable.",mercury4,2016-09-20,2016

3.0,Suspend all disbelief and you'll enjoy the ride,"Don't listen to anyone who tells you that this movie is ""grittier"" or ""more realistic"" than the others in the series. Unfortunately, the original film is still the most plausible, tightly-written, with the most likable characters and (even) best cast of the three. If you liked the other two, you'll probably enjoy this one. If you didn't, you should probably avoid it as there's really nothing new to see here. There's some fancy camera-work, but it is totally unrealistic on so many levels, least of all the opening sequence! However this review isn't entirely negative - while I'm the furthest thing from a petrolhead (I can't even drive!!) I enjoyed the film. It kept my attention and a smile on my face, eliciting several laughs and some emotional moments. It must also be noted that I only went to see this movie because I'm a fan of Lucas Black and it was his first leading role in a major film (I'd consider ""Friday Night Lights"" to be more of an ensemble piece). For me, all I was asking of this film was that it show me lots of Lucas and be more entertaining than ""FNL"" which it did very successfully. Lucas does a very credible job with the material he is given (and I gotta say I just love that accent). As his first big step to making the transition from child actor to leading man this movie has done the job for Lucas, and hopefully with the exposure this movie will bring him, we will be seeing much more of this very talented actor.",cheekyhobbit_nz,2006-06-15,2006
10.0,F&F 3 Rocked,"Fast and the Furious:Toyko Drift was an excellent movie. The races were interesting and the movie kept my attention the whole time. Some of the scenes of the movie had me on the edge of my seat, unlike the other 2, where I could fall asleep and miss nothing. Bow Wow did an excellent job (he actually looked like he belonged in the high school). The scenery was cool, especially the parking garage.The only draw back was that Vin Diesel only made a cameo, and the main racer was supposed to be under 18 and he looked like he was in his 30's. Other than that it rocked. The cars kicked butt (so did the paint jobs). It's a good movie to go see if you are bored out of your mind and you want to see something that will get you blood flowing.",buffyangelspikeyscoobysb,2006-06-27,2006
6.0,Doesn't quite make it,This spin-off attempts to take the series into a new territory but it doesn't quite succeed. The main issues being some miscast actors and the insane lack of coherency with the storyline.,carberav,2022-07-30,2022
4.0,expected better,"Tonight I watched the fast and the furious: Tokyo Drift.The drifting is fun to watch, but a campy plot and too much development time makes attempting to deepen an already shallow storyline seem much too overbearing. The acting, while not terrible is nothing great and the character's personalities are forced and way over the top. While this isn't a big surprise to anyone who has watched the other movies in series, the lack of well known cast members made it more apparent then usual. Plus, there is almost no police intervention in this one. even as a car drifts into a massive crowd of people and seconds later explodes, causing chaos.Apparently in Tokyo, the police don't mess with street racers because they can't catch them. Seriously, that's how it's explained.On the plus side of things, plenty of eye-candy can be found everywhere, and I'm not just talking about the cars. Japanese women are all portrayed as beautiful and stylish import girls, and their tiny vinyl skirts are just about as shiny as the finish on the cars. One thing must be said though. Japanese men are no where near as pretty as their women here. I'm sure some will disagree, but wow. Someone get those boys a mirror.Overall, it's not a dreadful film as there are some high points particularly during some racing stunts, but it's odd how young everyone is. Appparently the lead character isn't even out of high school. Right from the introduction the film generalizes what audience this movie geared towards. What makes this even dumber is how what they are doing is illegal. Bunch of kids disobeying the law and the cops could care less.It's rather mediocre for the most part and the only thing compelling me to recommend it for would be the racing, but i feel that there isn't even enough of that to balance this movie out.Pretty disappointing.",thefuzmixman,2006-06-19,2006

To repay his debt for the car he destroyed, Sean agrees to work for Han. This leads to the duo becoming friends, with Han agreeing to teach Sean how to drift. Han also loans him a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution for future races, explaining that he is helping him as Sean is the only person willing to stand up to Takashi And a drive off for honor we want him to bring him down simple.7 you killed this guy's brother, he is looking for revenge and he also try's to kill you so you get this, simple movie not complicate at all.

6.0,It's passable but not as good as the first: Would Recommend,"Directed by Justin LinStarring Lucas Black, Natallie Kelley and Sung KangPlot Overview: ​Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) always feels like an outsider, but he defines himself through his victories as a street racer. His hobby makes him unpopular with the authorities, so he goes to live with his father in Japan. Once there and even more alienated, he learns about an exciting, but dangerous, new style of the sport. The stakes are high when Sean takes on the local champion and falls for the man's girlfriend.After two very successful movie(commercially not critically), Justin Lin had a tough time trying to continue the franchise with none of the original cast members in it and I respect how good this movie is in spite of that. That doesn't make the movie 'good' however. It's a perfectly passable movie that I can see myself watching maybe every once and a while but it lacks a certain intrigue the first one contained and a neat charm the second possessed. The transition of directors in a franchise can be difficult and I understand that. I will also admit that it's better than '2 Fast 2 Furious' but that doesn't make it a very good movie. I imagine you will be entertained, and it is definitely for fans of the street racing aspects of these movies but I can't really say you'll be blown away by anything in this movie.The story isn't generally the thing you focus upon in these movies but if you do genuinely care then you'll be satisfied. It's a more grounded, race driven story that is very centered around one specific thing and sticks to that thing throughout the entire movie. The ending is actually pretty decent and I like how they stitch the franchise together.It's honestly quite hard to be the worst actor in a franchise that included Vin Disel but Lucas Black steals the only thing Disel had going for him in this franchise. I get he had no professional training but then in that case he shouldn't even be there if he possesses no ability to act. Sean's backstory isn't that interesting and he possesses no traits that make him a genuinely enticing character. Nattalie Kelley was also pretty poor as Neela and her character was pretty irrelevant. Sung Kang was good as Han and is this movies main saving grace. He's cool but you don't know WHY he is cool and that is really interesting. Bow Wow was meh as Twinkie but I can see the reason he hasn't been featured in any more movies up until this point. Brian Tee was also really weak as DK and wasn't a very good villain at all either. Brian Goodman was fine as Major Boswell.From a technical standpoint, the movie is fine. The cinematography was mostly fine and the actual race sequences were handled infinitely better than in the first two. Costume design was fine but the Set Design was really cheap, lazy and not natural.The actual action in this movie is extremely weak and the set pieces are awful. I get that wasn't the primary concern of this movie but that doesn't excuse it being weak. It is more enjoyable than '2 Fast 2 Furious' but inferior to 'The Fast and the Furious'.In conclusion, this movie is fine. It is a perfectly passable, average sequel that exists for the sake of existing. It is better than it's predecessor but inferior to the original. There is some enjoyment value to be had and I do sort of recommend it but I am blown away this movie was as successful as it was.6/10Would Recommend",EthanBJones_03,2017-05-10,2017
7.0,"Stellar for a Sequel, Just OK on its own","My first exposure to this movie was the theme song aptly named 'The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift'. The movie, once viewed, lived up to the expectations I had based on the style and energy of the song. Troubled youth Sean Boswell is shipped off to Japan to avoid jail time and falls in with a group of street drift racers. He befriends the only other non-native people, Twinkie and Neela, and becomes entangled with the local mob and his school peers. There is little need for the movie to exist, but boy is it fun. It feels almost like a playground drama blown out of proportion by the participant's minds, though the death and violence do upgrade the rating above PG. It feels a bit like a 'white man saves the day' story, given that it took an American to end Takaszhi's aggression in a flashy race. That being said, the franchise does tend to feature a specific type of leading man, and this is no exception to that theme.",rachelgallit,2020-01-31,2020

3.0,"Lackluster plot, brainless bimbos, & Some Rotten Acting","Well I never had the intention to see this movie, but my friend who has no taste in movies implored me to accompany him to this movie that promises to bring in a marginally slim profit. So a disrespectful adolescent is sentenced to go to his father who lives in Tokyo when he is apprehended by the local police when he decimates a construction site. For reasons I do not know, he was not incarcerated, apparently he can just be relocated. In Japan he in pulled into the ‘underground’ of competitive racing that incorporates a technique called drifting, I suppose no one on the continent of North America had ever had the notion of drifting before. So then while he is in this strange land he falls for the girl who's boyfriend is the nephew of the don of the Yakuza. Uh-OH, bit trouble! There's animosity, so how does it get resolved? By the means of a race! The race sequences are intriguing at first, but later they just become repetitive and use an endless string of shots that just disorientate the audience to create the cheap illusion of insane speed. The dialog isn't too much too look at, I almost died when the cliché of ‘let's end this once and for all’ was used to prompt the ‘final showdown’. Something else that I could not wrap my mind around is that the girls are not only flat out promiscuous in this renegade's dreamland, but also that they can be one over something as trivial as a car race. The director did a decent job, but a lot of his techniques were pretty minimalistic. But perhaps the most annoying aspect of this movie was the southern hick accent that was laid on pretty thick by Lucas Black. All in all, this is just going to be one of those movies that will fade into the obscurity of Action section in the back of Blockbuster video. If you want to walk away from a movie and feel fulfilled, just wait for Superman Returns and save yourself $7.50",boxybrown13,2006-06-18,2006
8.0,Drift this fellas,"There are some people who like their summer movies high-brow. There are some people who like them Van Helsing-style. Me? I like 'em f#@%in' fast & furious. And, my friend, I'll be damned if summer didn't finally arrive, I just saw Fast & Furious 3  Tokyo Drift. That's right, the latest edition of the fast cars and beautiful people franchise is coming back to theaters and it couldn't have made me giddier. And, this time, they're bringing on a new form of racing  because the speed is going international! We kick off in the States with our scrappy Southern hero (a perfectly serious Lucas Black  the kid from Sling Blade). He gets ridiculed by a local bully and whoops his ass in a pretty f@$#in' awesome race, complete with the smashes & crashes that we've come to know and love. Destruction is fun! But our hero gets into trouble and here starts our fish out of water story. Will our hero prevail? What do you think? It's Fast & Furious 3! Will our hero get the girl? Whatever! It's Tokyo Drift. Will I ever remember our hero's name? Who cares?! It's TOKYO F@#$KIN' DRIFT, BITCH! Look, there's no way to say that this is high art. But I really couldn't give a f$#k. This had me giggling and feeling' pumped up all the way through. That's why I loved the first two flicks sometimes, I just don't want to think. You don't have to take it seriously because it takes itself so perfectly seriously. Soon enough you get so wrapped up in what's at stake in the races, that you have to remind yourself that you have no idea what's actually at stake. I like how they have a new director with each movie. This time, Justin Lin has his turn and he does exactly what he needs to do, while adding a few flourishes along the way. He doesn't reinvent the wheel he just puts on new tires (*sigh*). At the very least, each director gets to tap into the latent homo-erotic charm which, I guess, comes as a part of street racing. The Japanese villain pierces our hero with come-hither looks that say, 'I want to drift all over your body.' Maverick & Iceman have some serious competition. So, I suggest you grab a few drinks, find the right buzz, and check this out. Just don't try drifting afterward. You can't do it. And the parking lot security doesn't appreciate it.",artestomento,2006-06-14,2006
6.0,"Even in a new locale, doesn't quite get up to speed","Well, the third installment of Universal's ongoing street fantasy is out, and as reluctant as I am to say it, what's good and bad about it is pretty much the same as the first two movies.Once again it's a crime story, although it takes a little while to get to it. We meet the troubled Shaun Boswell right away and see how his expensive, dangerous hobby lands him in the middle of Japan. We see him get entangled with a wannabe Yakuza and get embroiled in Tokyo's street racing scene. And we see what will eventually become hard, over-the-edge drifting.My problem is the same as always: It simply wastes too much time. The opening high school sequence was a complete waste of time; the story should've started after the move to Tokyo, with the opening duel shown in a flashback or video. I mean, what's the point of introducing that rich jerk if he's going to be completely irrelevant for 90% of the movie? The crime plot, as always, is irrelevant; there are much easier ways to convince Shaun Boswell to learn drifting, and without any real time to spend on this arc, it felt rushed and unconvincing. The army brat should've had more screen time; look at the deleted scenes and you'll see just how he was robbed.On the plus side...there's racing. And drifting. And for once, skill actually matters more than straightaway speed. For the first time, we get a real sense of danger; misjudge a corner or trade paint at the wrong time, and you're looking at major body damage or worse. The races are far more technical than the dragstrip-and-stop-sign action we've seen from Brian O'Connor and company, and the wild stunts are more over the top than ever (six words: drifting up a parking lot ramp).One thing that deserves special mention is the way street racing is portrayed...expensive, dangerous, not a whole lot of fun, and on occasion, horribly tragic. There's no attempt to gloss over the dark side of pushing a machine way beyond its normal limits in locations not designed for racing speeds. I appreciated this dose of reality (even though I suspect it was politically motivated). It really reinforced the idea that although this was incredibly cool, no way would I ever want to do it.Good summer entertainment. Wish it could've been more, as always, but, as Boswell himself would say, ""Them's the breaks.""",dkw001,2008-03-23,2008
4.0,Worst one so far,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift brings a fresh setting to the franchise, trading the familiar street races of LA for the neon-lit streets of Tokyo. While the change in scenery adds some visual appeal, the film struggles to capture the same excitement of its predecessors.The drift-racing scenes are well-shot and provide some adrenaline, but the weak plot and lackluster characters weigh the film down. Lucas Black as the lead feels out of place, and his performance is wooden, making it hard to connect with his journey. The dialogue is often clunky, and the absence of key franchise characters leaves a void that's hard to ignore.The movie's saving grace is its depiction of Tokyo's underground car culture, which adds a unique flair. However, without much substance behind the flashy action, Tokyo Drift ends up feeling like a hollow entry in the Fast & Furious series.",Bmore-Hero,2024-09-21,2024
6.0,"So FAST it'll make your head spin, hot girls and pimped out rides makes for popcorn adrenaline","The third installment to the ""Furious"" series where new low-life street punk (Black) moves to to Toyko with a relative after a street race turned dangerous. While there he get into the world of drifting, an underground street race where the light cars drift in the wind like a feather. Although in theory I should hate this movie for bad acting, stupid story and it's over all predictability-but it evens out with nice cars and some well done racing. Not to mention a few hot girls that'll catch your eye. ""Furious"" is nothing that will leave you breathless at least for me, but the race scenes are enough to recommend if you are a fan. I am not a fan of this series and saying this is the best doesn't say too much but enough to say-watch it. Director Lin does some nice camera techniques to make it more enjoyable and seem shorter than it is. Kudos for holding Diesel off to the last minute - **1/2",EvLauster,2006-09-23,2006
7.0,Fun but immoral,"The plot wasn't bad, but it was a bit wired that Japanese people in this film are not Japanese at all. Furthermore all the Japanese are stupid in the film.It was also weird that Japanese people talk to each other in English even not many Japanese people speak English. Considering that, so many foreign students and Japanese who speak English (supposed to be really cleaver if it's true) are in a poor public high school.",JB10001,2020-05-06,2020
4.0,Uncharismatic,"The first true side story in the Fast & Furious saga. We leave behind both Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and instead focus on Sean Bowell (Lucas Black), an Arizona youngster, who gets into trouble with his reckless driving and gets sent to Japan to live with his father. There he yet again gets into trouble due to his need to go fast.And that's fine. On paper it'd be nice to explore other cultures and their takes on street racing. The story is also loosely tied to the overall saga with the introduction of Han (Sung Kang), who joins Brian and Dom in the following films as a part of their crew, becoming a beloved character.Unfortunately the plot and characters in this film - with the exception of Han - are as bland as rice paper. Sean as a character pales miserably next to the raw charisma of Walker and Diesel, and the fact that he's supposed to be a teenager doesn't exactly help things. (Black was in his mid-20s when filming this film. So almost a decade too old.)And even though the racing in the film is nice, like it's in all of the Fast & Furious films, it's not enough to save the film.Out of all the F&F films, this is the only one I'd say you can safely skip without losing pretty much anything.",Vartiainen,2020-05-09,2020
8.0,Tokyo Drift: the best in the series,"This movie begins in a normal American high school, where a new student, Sean Boswell, challenges a football jock to a car race under the circumstances that whoever wins gets to take the jock's girlfriend to prom. They race through a dusty and crowded construction site...later leaving Sean to blast his way through a house, the jock rams his car into Sean's- Sean ends up rolling his car, and the Jock runs into something. They all end up in the police office. Needless to say the girl and the football guy get off easy, Sean, however, gets shipped to his dad's house in Tokyo. After arriving, and a shaky welcome between father and son, Sean settles down in his new bedroom and gets the new rules of the house: get up, go to school, come directly home, and not to be around cars at all. But can those rules stop the man from his need for speed? Not likely. There was a nice surprise at the end, Vin Diesel makes a slight appearance as Han's friend.",whispersofsorrow,2006-06-17,2006
1.0,Do not waste your time with this film,"This is by far the worst film from The Fast & The Furious series and the only one with a totally different crew. The only good thing about this film is the song: Teryaki Boyz - Tokyo Drift.Here are some of the reasons why you shouldn't waste your time with this awful film:1. The cast - totally untalented actors. The main character is a 17-year old teenager, but the actor was 24 (but looked at least 30). Moreover, he has a terrible cowboy accent and absolutely no talent. The only good actor is Han.2. The story line - totally ridiculous.3. Bad driving and cars compared with the other F&F films.4. Does not follow the chronological time frame of the other F&F films; it's basically a different story.Do not get me wrong, I absolutely love the other 5 F&F films (those with Paul Walker - RIP)which I recommend, but this one is just a waste of time.",raisa_od,2013-12-08,2013

Well, the second Fast and Furoius had a cooler UNIVERSAL promo... At first i thought it was going to be a teenager kind of movie and got disappointed, but after a while, it started to catch me... What can i say...the special effects got me off the chair... made me press that rewind button:)) The movie has some awesome special effects and a nice story...even dough it is standard... they fight over a girl, but in overall it is cool.

3.0,Is Vin Diesel the best part of this flick?,"No ... but his appearance is more disconcerting than seeing Donald Rumsfeld on Jon Stewart. It's a blatant teaser for the next F+F-Formula production, and his career side bet in case ‘Hannibal 2006’ doesn't pay off at the box office. The movie: absolute formula. ‘Characters dumb as a bag of rocks.’ Awful acting, ropey plot to kill time while waiting for the next hot cars and/or race-queen sequence. You might have 5 minutes of actual ‘drift racing’, but it's edited in that hyperkinetic MTV style so you won't really see anything... much less learn how to pay for $600+ sets of tires which last for mere minutes of use. The car action and incidental women are fine, but that shouldn't be enough for your movie ticket. You don't realize quite how far you've fallen until the sudden appearance of Diesel tells you it's time to leave the theatre air-conditioning; the movie's over and the ride was on *YOU*.",jginnane,2006-06-22,2006
4.0,The weakest of the F&F series,"The third installment in what was once the Fast and the Furious trilogy was a near total reboot with new characters and a new location. Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) is a troubled teen whose mother ship's him out to live with his military father in Tokyo. He encounters Twinkie (Bow Wow) who introduces him to the underground street racing culture of Tokyo. He flirts with Neela (Nathalie Kelley) and is challenged to a race by D.K. (Brian Tee). Loaned a car by Han (Sung Kang), Sean is introduced to drifting and the complication of trying to make the tight turns of this Japanese racing style. He destroys the car, loses the girl, and finds himself in debt to Han. Forced to carry out chores for Han, Sean makes a deal where he can learn how to drift as he familiarized himself with the underworld of Tokyo. Han takes him under his wing but there is trouble brewing with D.K.'s illegal business. With the help of Twinkie, Sean practices the art of drifting and attends his Japanese high school. The bully Morimoto (Leonardo Nam) is part of D.K.'s crew and beats up Twinkie before Sean steps in to stop him. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",swilliky,2017-04-14,2017

When i went to see it I thought it was the best of the lot. I thought the first race was equally as good as the last. I found with the other 2 the attention moved off the races and onto other things e.g. Carlos Verone, Monica Vuentas and Mia Toretto. I personally thought the twist at the end with Dom was a perfect ending despite not actually seeing the race. I have also found out the connection between Han and Torretto. After Dom's brief with Letty in Mexico they returned to California where Johnny Trent's car gang was falling apart and then Han transfered from johnny to Dominic where they raced for about a year. Thats about when Han returned to japan and Dom went around the time Shaun beat D.K. (The Japanese version of Justin Timberlake).",gedders2006,2006-06-18,2006

8.0,Pure Adrelinin Rush .............................and More!!!! (sequel as good as the original ?),"Lets face it critics are always going to pan such films because of 2 important reasons.1)They don't like such films (ans still people will not watch the movie going by the critics, don't you'll have your own tastes) 2)Its not cool for a so called cinema lover to like such films (this is the number 1 reason for the low ratings).I say F*&k those so called Critics.THIS IS A BLOODY GOOD FILM IN ITS GENRE.Hell this movie has everything, loads of HOT CARS, dozens, maybe even more HOT WOMEN, loads of ATTITUDE, CRAZT STUNTS (which in told and even i felt are not CGI), exotic settings (filmed in LA though i was told), ONE OF THE BEST EXECUTIONS OF BACKGROUND SCORE AND SOUNDTRACKS IN RECENT HISTORY, LOADS OF FRESH FACES,and did I say hot women and hot cars.......You get my point don't you, I would have liked to say that this is a GUY FILM but once again I was shocked by how much the women loved it (check out the breakup of the ratings), however I was in a theater filled with guys and each and everyone of us gasped when we saw the bevy of hot cars and women. Half of us cracked the SHIP US TO JAPAN JOKE.The movie did have some jarring problems for me, namely .....1) WHAT THE HELL WAS BOW WOW DOING IN THIS MOVIE, do filmmakers have to deliberately insert a black guy, and black talk in every film. THIS FILM IS SET IN JAPAN FOR GODS SAKE. Its hard to digest that the Japenese will accept a white guy but accepting a black guy who wears clothes 5 sizes bigger than him and talks like that.Hell and to add to that you had a few other Japenese dressed that way too, Japenese Yakuzo and underground dressed like that hell no.AND TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY THE BLACK GUY SOLD STOLEN AND CONTRABAND GOODS. Even if black guys want to see themselves represented in all films would they want to see the stereotypical black goods peddler. At least there was no actual scene of him selling it from behind his Van and scenes of him selling and smoking dope (i think the ratings may have had something to do with that).IS RAP AND CRIME ALL THERE IS TO BLACK PEOPLE. I don't think so.And while you think of all this you forget the fact the Bow Wow cant act.2)Where is the charismatic star, forget even Vin Diesel Black cant even measure upto Paul Walker, HOWEVER THE FACT THAT HE WAS THAT YOUNG ENDED UP APPEALING TO ME. (for a brief moment, i felt it was OK that I had had 10-11 accidents in my 8 yr driving career (I'm 23 hehe).3)An American Muscle car beating Japenese Technology??!!!! Hell even with the Jap Engine there is no way a car with such a high Center of gravity is going to survive 2 mins into this race.4)The other irritating American influences not only do we have black guy, HELL WE HAVE A LATINA GIRL god save me.5)In one obvious promo for the Jap Telecom Companies we had people seeing the final race live on their phones and the bow-wow saying stuff like..............you guessed it.""damn!"" ""that what I'm talking bout right there"" But these are trivialities and hardly dent the overall experience.You really should check out the soundtrack and background score of the film, trust me its great AND ITS USE IN THE MOVIE IS NOTHING SHORT OF SPECTACULAR THE EASTERN INFLUENCES ARE TOTALLY REFRESHING.The acting by the Japenese cast to good, so many new faces who can act super.A bloody technical masterpiece hats of to the entire production.YOU COULD ACTUALLY FEEL THE IMPACT WHEN THE CARS HIT SOMETHING.And FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT I CAN REMEMBER A MOVIE TRIES TO BE SOMETHING MORE THAN IT IS AND SUCCEEDS.This movie really scored because of these things 1)The contrast of the underground scene with orderly and rules oriented Japenese life, brilliant.2)The drifting scene with neela with crazy soothing music,clearly in contrast with the insane driving that was needed, poetic and brilliant.3)The problem most people, even people who have been in the same society (not only a foreign country) for a long time have FITTING IN. And how sometimes you could be a Kaijin on day and one of them the other. Insightful.This movie has many more such instances but it would only serve to lengthen this already long review.A MUST WATCH MOVIE FOR GUYS AND ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO WATCH A MOVIE WITH THRILL A MINUTE SEQUENCES ................AND MORE.We were so pumped after we saw this movie we actually raced on the streets of bombay till reality caught up with us. (actually our car lost, i was not driving hehe and the cars were..................hyundais haha a santro and a diesel...yup we sure were desperate to drift hehe).+S hot women, hot cars, crazy stunts, succeeds at being more than what its supposed to be , hot women, hot cars........+/-s the father son relationship badly handled, Japenese trusting a white guy at first glance.-s Bow Wow (the worst), American power prevails in the end.

5.0,Drifting Into Franchise Turmoil,"It's been well documented how the F&F franchise was pretty much garbage before The Rock came on to the series, and Tokyo Drift is more of the same. I had never sat through the entire runtime until now, and just as I thought, it's definitely not one of the better ones.In fact, Tokyo Drift is the second worst of the series, just in front of its predecessor, 2 Fast 2 Furious. This installment takes the series abroad, as we watch Sean Boswell played by Lucas Black, get brought back into the dangerous game of street racing and become acquainted with the technique of drifting. Boswell is supposed to be a teenager who gets sent away to live with his father in Tokyo after getting into trouble one too many times back home in Arizona. Black doesn't look young enough to be in high school, nor do I really see the need for the writers to make him in high school. Why not just make him a high school drop-out, a few years removed from a structured life, and someone looking for a place to call home. Perhaps, even refer to him as a constant ""drifter"". Poor Pun? Probably.With no sign of Paul Walker or Vin Diesel, Tokyo Drift is forced to carry on with actors who are better off served in supporting roles. Surprisingly, there isn't that one character or performance that's distractingly over-the-top like in the previous two adventures. At the same time, there's nothing all that special about any of the characters to begin with. There's certainly more of an attempt to add depth to the characters, with both the protagonist and antagonist having some serious family issues, but it's not fleshed out in an interesting way. Instead, most of it is addressed in a disappointingly cliché manner.You can tell there's something refreshing about Justin Lin's direction. He isn't repeating the same beats as the first two films in the same way that 2 Fast 2 Furious did. The decision to take it outside America and bring new cars and new characters was probably the correct choice, but it could have handled better. In the same vein, the lack of creativity in the plot is puzzling. Introducing an antagonistic uncle to Takashi who I think runs some sort of shady business was unnecessary. Not only did they refuse to really address the nature of his work but I'm not sure he added anything of value to the story, at all.Does it matter that the second and third F&F movies are poor? Not really. With where the series is now, it doesn't really matter to me that the first few films struggled to find the right tone. What's important is that they have found the right speed now.

3.0,Stylistically excellent; Otherwise atrocious,"I watched this 2006 movie in 2009, in advance of the fourth installment coming out. I found it extremely poor and I want to let you know why. 1. It's not a ‘The Fast and the Furious’ movie. The first two installments established the franchise as involving illegal streetracing, organized crime, and undercover law enforcement. This movie is about a high school outsider who proves himself, finds his place, and gets the girl (a plot in which streetracing is a trope and organized crime is incidental). There's nothing wrong with that kind of movie, except the title in this case. (It's like The Karate Kid but with cars. The Car-ate Kid.) In fact, it's more of a sequel to director Justin Lin's 2002 film ‘Better Luck Tomorrow’, since it at least has a character in common with that movie (Sung Kang as ‘Han’). Might as well have called it ‘Better Luck Tomorrow, White Boy.’ 2. Lucas Black is a terrible actor. Who decided to turn this guy into a lead performer? I thought his 'Bama accent, wooden expressions, and awkward approximations of feeling were laughable when he was a child star on ‘American Gothic’. As an adult with ten years of experience, he should have made some progress. Alas, he has not. When your lead is inaccessible and unlikeable, your movie tends to suffer. 3. The cinematography and style are excellent and groundbreaking. The story is cliché and clumsy. The 3/10 score I gave it is ALL for the former. 4. Ooh, he wins the big race using an American car with Japanese guts. Do I smell symbolism? Yes I do, and it smells awful.",murrayspeer,2019-11-05,2019
10.0,A Masterpiece to Expose the Cliquey Bullshit of Film Critics Everywhere.,"Tokyo Drift : Literally one of the gold standards of evidence to verify the impotence of film critics to like a film that they would not on the face of it look cool liking. A film to expose the cliquey self-pandering limp bullshit, and vaporous affected vanity of film critics everywhere. Since, actually there is plenty of multi-layered and playful reversals of expectations and subtle transgressions against types that occurs in this film. It's big, genuinely emotive, well-paced and deliciously playful, but it wasn't written to suck the cocks of film critics so of course, they don't put out. Perhaps most damningly of all, a film critic liking this film would then have to endure placing him or herself in the same row of the cinema as a 'dumb-jock' or motor-head, who could also enjoy it, albeit for perhaps somewhat altered reasons. This is the core of the films humble brilliance : equally valid different readings that drop a laser-guided drone-strike on film critic pretension. 5 severed-heads-of-film-critics for this masterpiece.",cris-stringfellow,2012-12-07,2012
2.0,Doesn't even count as Part 3!!,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift Starring: Lucas Black, Bow Wow, Zachary Bryan and Brian Tee Genre: Action/Crime/Drama Rated: PG-13 I'm a big fan of ‘The Fast and the Furious’ movies but this movie totally ruined it! Now from what I've read is that the next ‘The Fast and the Furious’ movie that comes out in Summer 2009, is supposed to be a prequel to this movie. But why didn't they have this movie be the 4th movie instead of the movie that actually followed up from the events that happened in the first 2 movies? It's ridiculous, you can't just start off a movie franchise and then in the middle of making more movies just put the plot events out of order, it doesn't work that way! So I don't think this movie even counts as a part 3, I will consider the next movie to be part 3 but I consider this movie a pointless and worthless piece of crap! Anyway, the story revolves around an American teenager named Shaun Boswell (Lucas Black) is sent to Tokyo to live with his father in order to avoid jail time in America and discovers street racing and now he has to do street racing in the Tokyo underworld in order to find a way to pay his debt. Like I said, I don't even consider this movie to be a part 3 to the first 2 movies. If they're going to do a sequel they have to do it right and not mix up the order of events!

10.0,This was the ONE movie of the franchise connecting all others,"*** This review may contain spoilers *** When I first heard about Tokyo Drift and realized that it would feature none of the original cast members, I was hesitant to see it. Can you imagine what a risk the producers took to make this one? At that time we did not know it was the ONE movie of the franchise connecting all others with one of its major characters. Sung demonstrated a lot of talent, making his heartbroken character believable. We see his emotions throughout the movie and we want to know what happened to him, to understand him a little better. After watching Fast 6 come back and see this one. It will all add up. I've seen so many reviews saying that character development was too hurried, for those saying that I only want to say this: Have you watched all the movies???? It annoys me so much seeing people review without knowing what these movies are about. Tokyo Drift takes place after 6, which shows how much effort the writers and producers put into this franchise. It was all written way back. To have that imagination is effing amazing. When I first saw Tokyo Drift, I could not see what it had to do with The Fast and Furious series. I got mad. I just couldn't get it. Funny thing is that the character I loved the most was HAN. My brain was blow away when I saw the other movies. I was like ‘What's happening? Isn't he dead?’ ‘What? How? When?’ So you can imagine that after knowing he's going to die seeing the relationship developing with Gisele was killing me. Now I could see why he wasn't giving a s**t. Like, he was the coolest out there without showing it. Why wasn't he claiming his spot? Because he lost everything that really mattered to him. Ride or die, remember? What a way to blow our minds. You killed it with the whole plot dear writers. I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF THE 8 MOVIES launched so far. And yes, I will be a die hard fan of this franchise even when I'm 50.

4.0,Pointless instalment in the series,"TOKYO DRIFT is the unwanted second sequel in a film franchise that seems to have absolutely zero point in existing – unless it's to get teenage boys to part with their pocket money. Each film is a stultifying excuse for flashy cars to be raced around and wrecked while attractive women in little clothing look on and cheer or boo as required. The first movie saw Vin Diesel playing a bone-headed racer in one of his worst performances; the sequel kicked him away and left wooden leading man Paul Walker to make a mess of his duties. This film does away with them both in favour of Lucas Black, a guy who I used to like when he was a child actor in '90s TV series American Gothic.Nowadays Black is all grown up and as typically handsome-but-wooden as any other actor. He seems to have lost his charisma but then all the cast of this film live in a charisma-free zone. The light story sees him packed off to Japan to curb his racing tendencies, but inevitably he runs foul of a Yakuza gang when he starts racing again. It's same old, same old, with stock supporting characters and an uninteresting cast – aside from a cameoing Sonny Chiba, still proving his worth in a fun role as a mob boss.These films are all about the races and these ones are pretty predictable. There are some interesting crashes and a few stunts here and there, but my heart wasn't really in any of them. I could enjoy the explosive chases in a film like DEATH RACE but I couldn't stop yawning as I watched the races here. They're serviceable perhaps but they're not going to set anybody's world alight. Then the film ends with a laughable twist that sets things up for yet another needless sequel. When are these guys going to give up?",Leofwine_draca,2016-07-11,2016
8.0,Tokyo Drift,"The title says it all. New Fast and Furious is placed in the Japan more specific in Tokyo. But that is not all that is new. There is nothing same from the previous movies. All characters are new. Car tuning stays the same like before, I love they left that part. But racing is changed to drift. I like it, it bring something new, more exciting that sprint 1/4 mile race. Plot is better the last movie. This time it is not about bad guys and good guys, this time it is about rivalry between main character and main yakuza nephew (they are fighting for girl, what a surprise). He as a new guy came to Tokyo, never drifted before, lost a race. Han (man who saw potential in him, teaches him how to drift). Main char and yakuza made a mess in the city. And they will decide with the race who lives the town and who stays and get a girl. It is good movie definitely better the last one. So underrated, it deserves 8. Anyone who enjoy fast driving will love it. Finishing scene is awesome it take so much part later on :D",BearGlove,2013-05-29,2013
5.0,"half decent, half bore","I think it is ironic that this is called fast and the furious when half the film is utterly boring and pointless. The film had great potential, especially in the beginning. It covered the cultural shock quite well and in some ways, was hoping it would expand on it. However, after about 40% in, it decided to focus more on this ""drift world.""That in itself is not a problem, but suddenly it went from creative to cliche. At this point the plot just dragged and literally nothing happens for a while until the ending sequence.A better editing definitely could've helped, I would say trim it down to around an hour and 20 to 30 mins would make this film run a lot smoother.5/10.",Luv2Spooge,2022-07-04,2022

3.0,"Some impressive fake (CGI) driving, but not much else","I'm a car guy and this movie would be worth watching if the driving were real. But much of it is not. The driving scenes are often enhanced with CGI (computer graphics) and while the special effects team did a good job, that takes the thrill out of watching it for me. So when a driver is drifting to within an inch of a concrete wall, that wall likely wasn't there in real life.Having Tokyo as a backdrop does add some interest. There aren't many US movies that spend much time in Japan. Lost in Translation was a notable exception.The rest of the movie is worse than the other two. The acting is mostly dreadful, the story isn't believable, and neither are some of the characters. If you're thrilled with fake driving and fighting over women, it might be worth a watch. If you want to see real street racing at speeds far in excess of anything in these movies, check out the (hard to find) European Ghostrider series of motorcycle street racing DVDs. There's no plot, but the action is extreme, thrilling and very real.",mikeatlarge,2006-12-09,2006
4.0,"The overall Movie lacks a good content, yet the Cars keep up the pace","The overall Movie lacks a good content, yet the Cars keep up the pace of it. On the realistic factor comparing to other versions, this had a quite low factor and low in action as well. Attractiveness of the movie solely came from the cars and not the entire movie for simple sake it didn't have the good characteristics of a film. The Evo was ever attractive. It was disappointing that it couldn't turn up for the last race instead Mustang took over. Han's death was disappointing, but Return of Vin Diesel was a good sign in the end of the movie.I have seen all the version of the movie, and one thing was common: RX-7s and the Mustangs were dominating the movies. My personal suggestion is that, if there were another version, then Lancer Evo should take the upper hand of it and also some Karate+Kungfu would make it a good one next time even.",ghostbusters242,2006-10-08,2006

10.0,"Simple yet fun,entertaining and different....","I went to see this movie without any expectations. I had low hopes, only expecting a repetition of the same simple plot, revolving around cars and women. Sure I love movies with mixtures of such things but i didn't expect this one to be more engaging, exciting and at times thought provoking in terms of dealing with present reality that revolves around us.The drifting theme along with Tokyo influences makes it even more unique as comparison to the other two. This one is pure entertainment, though i found the protagonist a little hard to like at first, just being engaged through their experience makes everything not matter...

1.0,"If you want a car movie, don't see this","Personally, I absolutely love cars. Especially small, Asian imports. In fact, I would even call myself a car enthusiast of sorts. I also love movies. I would call myself a movie enthusiast. So it stands to reason that I would jump at the opportunity to see movies about cars, and I usually do. I've seen the first Fast and the Furious, I thought it wasn't exactly a car purist's movie (a bit too many racecars with stereos and superfluous lights), but it had a minimum of silly ‘scene’ business and a bonus of an actually authentic drag strip race day. I didn't see the second one because it seemed to me like it was just going to be a movie for scenesters. Fast forward to Tokyo Drift: Here we have a movie that's not actually about racing at all, it's about ‘Drifting’. Drifting is to racing like speed skating is to figure skating: drifting is actually judged, which in my mind seriously defeats the purpose. But seeing people drive practical sports cars with small engines and better performance with positive atmospheric induction and stuff piqued my interest. But, it turns out to be a stupid movie with a stupid plot and not really any racing focus. They actually use the emergency brake to ‘drift’ which is actually done by driving the back tires really hard and oversteering through a turn. I was disappointed. You will be too.",tuyop,2006-10-03,2006
9.0,Good movie elevated by awesome action.,"This movie has to be the most entertaining thing i have seen all year even though i still think the first one was better. But moving it to Tokyo was a smart move as this brings a fresh atmosphere. Some of the acting was terrible but what do you expect. Lucas Black is a likable replacement for Paul Walker and Bow Wow does okay. Some of the Japanese actors are really good, but the real stars are the cars and boy do they look good, they go from show ponies - twink's car to awesome drift cars- Han's car. The action sidepieces are totally amazing the action goes from good to great through the movie. Over all this is an awesome popcorn movie and i recommend it to everyone just for the action and the big surprise at the end!! 10 out of 10",the_con_man298,2006-06-17,2006
3.0,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) - I Hate This New Kid, Even When He Tries to Drift!","This entry in the series isn't technically a third movie, because the movie is set after the events of the last two movies, ""Fast and Furious"" and ""Fast Five"". So you can probably say that this is more like the fifth movie, in some way. As a fan of the first ""Fast and the Furious"", and a believer that the second movie was alright, the third installment of this exciting series is the only movie in the series where I was left thinking: ""When will the torture end?"". Out of all the ideas to make a third movie in the series, they had to make this one. This movie in the series now takes place in Tokyo, where all the race car driving involves drifting. The only enjoying moments in this movie were Sung Kang's awesome performance as Hang, the cool drift scenes, the cute girlfriend, and Vin Diesel's amazing cameo at the end. That was it. Everything else was disappointing and unfaithful. Lucas Black is the new kid in Japan, and he plays one of the worst leading performances by a young actor in cinema history. He's a total, annoying idiot, with no idea of drifting, and he will never get the babes. I felt asleep throughout, and decided to ditch the movie at some parts, to do more better things than watching this. Now, I understand that the movie couldn't have Paul Walker and Vin Diesel throughout the movie, because of what the movie had to be. But I'm just saying that if Walker and Diesel were in the movie, and it was their storyline, then this movie would have been better. This can be action-packed, but it's instead unintentionally funny. I thought that this would be a bigger, better version of the series, but all it gave me was a super headache. This movie is not favorable to true cinema lovers, and disappointing for the fans of the ""Fast and the Furious"" series.

9.0,Underated Movies in the series - definitely one of the better ones.,"This movie seems to be one of those that people either love or hate. On the one hand, its very different to the other movies, and a lot of people dislike it.
But some of the rankings for the whole series put this in second place.The advantage Tokyo Drift has is, at its core, its a story about a boy in trouble, in a foreign place, and with little support from family.
There's not machine guns or CGI or unbelievable stunts. There's not the Rock or Vin Deisel. It's fairly realistic, and the setting in Tokyo is superb.
The main actor plays it understated, and none of the over the top charactatures we see in the other movies.
I've watched most of the movies, and while they are entertaining, the drama and plot in Tokyo drift, in addition to the amazing settign and visuals, is the one I have watched repeatedly.",info-5918,2019-07-09,2019
2.0,Go instead: Legend of Speed,"This was the least entertaining film I've seen recently. Don't get me wrong, I am a girl AND I enjoyed The Fast and The Furious, as it was a ‘piece of fun’. But this film is exhibit A when people speak of the ‘no plot, all action’ movies that come out of America these days. I had two main problems with this movie: 1) This film was set in Tokyo, yet the main character didn't speak Japanese, he was placed in a school where classes were taught in Japanese. Also, I have never seen so many American-speaking Japanese actors in one movie, this film pays no respect to the culture, showing viewers a false world that Japan is truly accessible to non-Japanese speakers (which is not the case), that the Japanese people are most willing to sideline their own language to benefit one ignorant American person. 2) The great holes in plot was what makes the viewer feel dislocated from the characters, events. It is a rule in film that you have a ‘build’ then a ‘climax’, (meaning that the tension within a story is built, holding the viewer's attention then at the ‘climax’, the viewer feels the desired emotion of the event eg. death, birth, shock) This film does not use this: the plot goes along steadily, then hits ‘climax’-like points without ‘build’ or even explanation! I sat there often thinking ‘who's that?’, ‘what just happened?’ Even with the death of the main character's friend, which was supposed to make the viewer feel sad at that moment, missed target because of no ‘build’. The events went as follows: car business is alerted to money being taken from accounts, car business owner threatens and tries to kill said friend, main character and others escape in a car, friend is getting away as well in another car, friend's car crashes and he burns to death. The death leaves viewers confused as to what they have just seen. We are told hurriedly about the company's accounts, which we really should have been alerted to before, this is truly poor scripting. Overall, I find this movie to be too loose in the story-telling, not enough research was done about the location. I wasn't even too fond of the ‘drifting’. The final race between the main character and his nemesis was too close to being reminiscent of the Speed Racer series, for my liking. If you want a movie in a similar vein, try ‘The Legend of Speed’. It did what the filmmakers were trying to achieve here.",angel_starfine,2006-06-27,2006

I believe that the film will only make money for watches who has 5+1 surround systems so it will just make enjoyable to listen the cars and races. another bad part of the film is that the scenario is so typical!!!there is a girl at the other part,and a man on the other hand being successful at races for the girl...I thing we saw it a for a million time...",mefairo,2006-09-16,2006
8.0,The Best Part of the Movie,"I just finished watching the movie right now. It was better then I had expected it to be. It was better than 2 Fast 2 Furious. The plot was semi weak, however no one really cares about that in a movie like this,( I sure don't). Anyways, the best part is when Sean pulls behind Vin Diesel's Plymouth and the Don Omar song starts playing, and then they begin talking. I thought that was the best part in the whole movie, I enjoyed the song, does anybody know the name of that song? I would greatly appreciate it. Who else thinks that is the best part in the movie? If not, what is your favorite part.................................???",rubengarcia2007,2006-10-13,2006
5.0,A little bit lost as to what the point of this instalment was,"I'm a big fan of the Fast franchise, but I must admit I'm struggling to defend this instalment.Yes, we are introduced to Han who is a great character and gets a lot of mileage in the franchise, but that is not enough to excuse the many flaws of this film.The main character... I'm sorry but this part was woefully miscast. Lucas Black did not work in this role at all. To offer some defence, the part was bland and the character awfully written, so he had little to work with, but in any case he was not the man for the job.The story is weak. There are some decent racing sequences but aside from Han the characters are such a chore.Ultimately this film suffered from being too detached from the main franchise. I think I benefited from watching it after having seen the later instalments with Han in, so it was nice seeing his origins. Aside from this though there is little to redeem this pretty bland entry into an otherwise solid franchise.",ethanbresnett,2022-03-27,2022

If you listen to the cars's voices you can learn how to shift like a pro :) . But don't think about the characters so much 'cause some of them are not suitable for their characters. For example Sean. He is going to high but he doesn't seem to be a high school student ... And don't underestimate the girls. They are beautiful and goodlooking but cars are more lovely :D. By the way musics are really gives you the emotion of the scene. Some times i think the musicians are driving with the cars with their instruments.

5.0,Cliché but still somewhat entertaining,"I must admit that this film was better than I thought it would be. Still, it's basically KARATE KID PART II with cars. Has all the stereotypes and clichés in the book, but for some reason I still had fun with it despite myself. Some dialogue is painful and a few scenes felt better suited for direct to video but the acting was decent enough and the car chases stood out. Out of the trilogy, I enjoyed this one the most. The ""cameo"" at the end drew some applause in the theater I saw it in, but to me it felt tacked on and more of a marketing gimmick. I liked it enough to recommend but better to catch a matinée or wait for video.",Hakkaida,2006-07-12,2006
4.0,The black sheep of the fast and furious franchise,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift was prime evidence that the franchise desperately needed a makeover. Not only did it dispose of its popular protagonist in exchange for a cheap lookalike, but also, aside from a couple cool race scenes, it's really just a huge mess. The plot simply advances because the writers need it to, there aren't any real substantial plot elements that keep the audience involved. The story itself seems just like a rehash of any classic gang feud film, and it comes as no surprise to me that the franchise was turned towards high-octane heist films. That transition was definitely for the better, because this formula quickly ran thin.Not even a quick appearance from Vin Diesel could save this film, as his appearance only served to up audience ratings before its release. It may seem like a cool little nod to the previous films, but it doesn't make me care about this new character any more than I already didn't. The film's look is extremely dated, even for 2006. It felt like a real step back from 2 Fast 2 Furious, rather than a revolutionization of the series. I wouldn't have minded Paul Walker's absence if these characters could have held their own, but sadly they just fall flat before the story can even pick up steam.This is probably my least favorite entry in the franchise, and not because Paul Walker wasn't in it. While his absence didn't help matters, the story as a whole felt very uneven and didn't flow through very well. It was pretty unbelievable at times as well, not because of the stunts, but because of the plot itself. Certain things happen just for the sake of happening, with no real substance or process shown in between. It's too convenient to be a good film, despite the stylish driving tactics. Drifting car races are the highlights of the film, but everything in between is just too pointless and shallow to make this a good film. It's a mediocre at best effort, and the weakest entry in the franchise.",ryanskywalker-87402,2017-04-22,2017

I liked him in Better Luck Tomorrow, thats how I started viewing his films, too bad that there is not much information in the internet about him. I liked all of the Fast and the Furious movies, but this third one is my favorite. Its different and plus the setting is nice.

4.0,Improbabilities compounded by impossibilities.,"Well, most people here accurate in this films assessment. And cars are the stars and nothing else. Bow Wow sucks, playing a typical Black kid selling broken sh*t. Lucas Black sucks and is the poster child for for the typical ass-hole, know-it-all American, no wonder people hate us. There is no 'higher meaning' to this film, it's suggested racing can solve everything and the winner is right about whatever. We are expected to believe that as soon as this American comes to Japan, he is allowed to race somebody else's very expensive car, AND be allowed to join the same guys crew, as closed as Japanese society is. Right. Nathalie Kelley is one of the chicks that go to Blacks school, and no doubt she is hot. If you throw plot to the win and just try to watch the movie for the girls, cars and Japanese society then you will have a decent experience. I watch a lot of foreign Asian films, and the Asians in this movie do a great job, far better than their American counter-parts. The cars were OK, but how could they do a drift movie without the greatest Japanese sports car ever made, the Nissan Skyline? That over-site is inexcusable. Most of the cars are mediocre at best, they don't really showcase the best of the breed, they mostly have lower-end models, except for the 350Z they used. The race scenes were average but I expected a little more. I won't tell you not to go see it, as you will have to make up your own mind, but you will like it if you throw any expectations to the wind and suspend reality for awhile and just look at the girls and cars. This flick is just for that racing-type of crowd.",zv300,2006-08-07,2006
8.0,"standard story, COOL techniques!","honestly, i wasn't too excited about this movie when it hit the theater. since the previous series of fast and furious didn't impress me much.. :p but then i heard the soundtrack and then i got curious and stuffs. so i went ahead and saw the movie and hey, i don't regret it at all :) i think the story's just a typical one, nothing special about it but nothing bad either. i'd give the story a 6. but i would give an 8 or a 9 with the DRIFT!! it's so cool, especially when i saw the drift the first time! i'd give the soundtracks an 8 as well. luckily with an average plot like that, Tokyo drift has more action than the talking. i think it's a plus, so we don't get bored. :) there's a little confusion for me in the end though..

2.0,The fast and much too boring,"The fast and much too boring I'd like to rename this film. We've now seen it all before in the previous episodes, boy racers racing their cars against one another and someone winning. So, now having established the plot as repetitious we should possibly move onto the unrealistic details involved in the storyline. A Boy racer (played by Lucas Black,) is deported to Tokoyo because he has been caught by the police for racing cars on multiple occasions. This in itself is unbelievable. Remember the football/soccer World Cup in 2002 which was held in Korea and Japan? Diego Maradona, one of the greatest football players ever, was banned from seeing it in the flesh because he had taken cocaine many years previous to the world cup and thus had a conviction against his name, well, the story is trying to tell us the boy racers' are deported from a libertarian country to a much more totalitarian country which don't (for the large part) take ex-convicts. Not really believable is it? Well, let's ignore that part and move onto the next unbelievable phase. I shall at this point quote onig-1 from Canada who also comments on IMDb.com: ‘As a Navy brat that lived in Japan when I was a kid, I for a fact know that Navy kids do not attend Japanese schools, they attend American schools. Navy officers do not live in shacks in Tokyo, they live on the base, because they get big houses for 25% of the price. In Tokyo drift they do neither of these things.’ So, now we know the bases of this film are just simply wrong we can move to the conclusion and find problems in this to. Lucas Black learns to drift in just days (seemingly) and is taken in and trained by someone who turns out to be a backstabbing snitch (Han). Fortunately for the young American boy racer, Han chooses to take advantage of DK's trust instead of Lucas's clear vulnerability. DK is the nephew of 'the godfather' and, because Han decided to rip of DK he eventually loses his life to him sensible, logical? You decide. Furthermore, DK doesn't have bullet-proof glass on his car (as he is able to shoot through the front window when firing at Han) which is rather strange, it seems politic to assume that someone who holds such a prestigious and dangerous position in society would have thought to have prepared himself against anyone attacking him whilst he was in the confinement of his car. Toward the end of the show, DK has a gun placed to his head by a navy officer (Lucas's father) and there are many opportunities for the navy officer to shoot (unless you are now going to tell me DK can drive and has a better aim-of-shot than someone whose duty it is to train with a gun daily). However, despite this, the Navy officer chooses not to shoot! Why? I thought Blood was thicker than water, I wonder how many people could not envision themselves shooting in that precarious situation? Finally, and possibly worst of all, the dramatic character change at the end that only a slug (and the director's seemingly) could have missed. We know only one thing about Lucas Black's father - he is vehemently opposed to letting his son race. However, after an unexplained volt face in characterisation toward the end of this film he lets Black race for no reason whatsoever. In my experience of people in a position of power (such as a navy officer) they will want to be aware of all details before giving the go-ahead - especially if it happens to be a juvenile delinquent with a bad reputation for doing what he is suggesting. In this case, I think it would be fair to presume the go ahead would not be given - but not in this film. So, he lets his son race against DK and even helps fund him by supplying him with his own car. I also doubt that many fathers in the knowledge of the full facts would let their son race in that situation. I note at this juncture that I have made no reference of Lucas's relationship with Nathalie. I'm avoiding this subject as it seemed to be a rather useless side-plot which had no meaning to the core of the show. So, now we have considered all the characters to be unrealistic, the narrative to be simply implausible and the whole film is not thought-out we should possibly move onto the positives. There is one, and ONLY one positive in my view to credit this film with - if you miss a lot of the film you can still follow the story. It is so simple it might be worth turning to another channel to watch 15 minutes of it at a time and when you get bored of it turning it back over to something a lot more interesting. If your only interest is to watch boy racer's fantasies come true with a poor plot then this is your film. Unfortunately, like me, I think the majority of the world can do without it.",sparkster24,2006-07-17,2006
4.0,This one's all smoke and mirrors,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, or 3 Fast 3 Furious as my friends jokingly called it, is the story of a troubled youth who is sent to Tokyo to his father in hopes he will stop his ways as a trouble maker and buckle down and focus on school. However, instead of focusing on school he falls in with a crowd of street racers who specialize in the racing style of ‘drifting’. Throw in some crap about the Yakuza (japanese mafia) and a protagonist who has the usual hissy fit about the main character ‘talking to his girl’ and you have a typical bland modern special effects show-off crap-a-rama. The writers throw together the usual Fast and the Furious storyline of a bunch of people who do nothing all day and race at night in cars that might cost more than your average American home, yet these people are not even slightly remorseful when the presumably 6 figure car is absolutey totaled. In fact most of the time they can be seen a few scenes later in another extremely expensive car that seems to build itself out of nowhere. This story is pretty much the exact same as 2 Fast 2 Furious, except it's in Japan. The acting isn't anything spectacular, in some spots it's downright poor. The race scenes are little drawn out and get boring after awhile. It's the usual cookie cutter action movie, forbidden love story-check, rich over privledged immature protagonist-check, crime syndicate tie in-check. There really isn't much story to spoil, it plays out exactly as you would imagine. Only go to see this one if you really cars or crappy cookie cutter modern movies.",Hungry-Dingo,2006-07-07,2006
8.0,Gets Better with years.,"As a child, i do remember, seeing my friends and spending the whole afternoon watching this film. Everytime. I'm in love with the franchise, but especially, i'm in love with Tokyo Drift. First of all, the soundtrack. 
One, simple word. Amazing. From the first scene to the last. Still singing ""My Life be Like Ooh Aaah"" one decade after. The ""Barracuda"" song, also. The one that spells the word ""Barracuda"". Awesome. And of course the song in the parking lot, ""Fast And Furious"". The famous one. Then, the characters. 
Characters are well written. Of course they are full of clichès. It must be. It's a fast and furious one. Nathalie Kelly looks like a dream. Lucas Black is also a great main character. Bow Wow, he makes me laugh. And Sung Kang, the one playing Han, he's the real hero. So cool. James Dean of the franchise. You can easily fall in love with every character. Even the bad guys are cool. And, last but not least. The Cars. 
Changing to one driving style to another. To let the franchise fresh. Good choice. But then. Cars are so hot in this movie. From first till last race. I'm in love with drift cars. With the red Lancer, the Slylines and of course with Han's RX7. Amazing. If own a car, or a motorbike, and you love it. Well that's the movie for you. Definitely. I'm huge a fan. So this is gonna be a huge 8. Please, do not kill the franchise, ever.",yepp-922-27352,2018-09-09,2018
2.0,The Cars acted better than the actors...,"Do you have a grudge on someone and feel like bashing the hell out of him? Why turn to violence when the solution is right under you a**? Yes, it the seat of your car. Ask the dude to opt for this slightly non-violent method of solving your grimaces. Race em'... In the end, you both would be friends, leaving behind some minor civil destruction. A race car maniac is punished by sending him to Japan. ‘Holes’ anyone? It was much better than this crap. Anyways, Japan is nowadays no different than the USA, except the cops out there don't choose to chase a car going over 180 kph. The maniac is now in a Japanese school, obviously learning Japanese now, and is surrounded with Japanese dudes and babes, with the exception of an American aptly named Bow Wow. The maniac is in trouble again when he tries to strike a chord with a girl who is already engaged by a mafia don's nephew. So, to solve the problem between them they strike up a brilliant plan...Drift Race!!! Obviously, you know who wins in the end. I am not being highly critical about this movie. It is just that I was disappointed. Except for the cars and the brilliantly performed drift race sequences (yeah, yeah, and the chicks too), I found the rest of it as choking as the smoke coming out from a jammed exhaust. In the end, I do feel that this movie could have been better. Vin Diesel does appear in the end giving us hope that the next sequel would be a bearable one.",imran-sayed,2006-07-24,2006
10.0,Top!!,10/10 * Cool movie. I love cars. This part is my favorite of the Fast Furious Line. And this is the right place for cool cars.,blackshooter-63065,2020-04-23,2020
2.0,Boooring!,"This movie had about nothing good in it. The main character for once had the most annoying accent ever heard in a movie. I hope it is fake or I feel sorry for Lucas Black... This movie doesn't ever get off the ground. In the beginning I am a little optimistic, but it is nothing which get me intrigued in the plot. Unfortunately are the relationship between the characters of no interest and the dialogs suck too. Comparing to the 2 previous ""Fast and the Furious"" movies this one has nothing to offer. It is NOT a cool action movie like I would characterize the previous movies. I didn't expect a whole lot when seeing this movie, but this was actually worse!",LilleMonster,2006-10-26,2006
3.0,You can find better activities than this,"I was never a fan of sport/race cars, but it's always interesting to watch high speed and thrilling race. In this movie, only two things may catch your eye - nice chicks, when they appear and good looking cars... and... that's it, folks.It could be quite a good comedy, when you can see a car breaking the speed of 1 Mach (it means velocity of sound, ~330m/s) and when camera suddenly goes to a cabin and shows the speedometer and you see ""WOW! it's whole 90 km/h"" - that's pathetic. Today's scooters can reach that speed at ease.At the final race you can see a secret Japanese ""transportation system"" used. How can people standing at one point film whole race lasting approx. 5 minutes, when cars reach speed of 200 km/h ?? A real phenomenon movie. Film director and screen writer must have been facing brain meltdown, when filming this.By the way, about FX - they totally suck, for example, if you look at the car crash (at about little more than 1h from the start of the movie) you can see a disgusting computer graphics work at it. To be straight I mean, when the 3D parts at the side of the engine are shown.In overall, a nice sci-fi movie (perhaps word ""science"" should be omitted).",Odysei,2006-07-04,2006
8.0,a cool movie that presents modern tokyo and has awesome drifting and action,"i personally LOVED this movie! and so did all my friends who watched it in the theatre with me:]As a overseas military brat, living in japan, and being half Japanese, i could really relate to the movie. Over here, drifting is definitely the cool thing to do. I don't know how popular it is in the states but here, anyone that is into cars is in love with drifting! So it was really cool to see all the action and the awesome stuff the characters did in the movie!The movie actually covers a lot of what japan really is, which makes me really happy. I don't think a lot of Americans really know what modern tokyo is really like. The girls are seriously annorexic! And the fashion is wild! A lot of girls where clothes that BARELY cover them. Short skirts, hooker style. Either that or they have some REALLY weird fashion, uber Gothic, or hair with crazy colors and weird cuts! Some of the things in the movie aren't really accurate, but overall you can see what the real japan is like in this movie! We don't carry samurai swords anymore. sorry...Even if you don't know anything about drifting, you should give this movie a shot, because there is a nice plot to it and the action sequences are amazing. It'll always have you on the edge of your seat, and cringing at every close call or gasping when there is an accident.i haven't seen the other fast and furious movies, but i loved this one and if you like action driven movies, this is the one for you!",meloncoke-1,2006-07-05,2006
5.0,Change Of Pace Doesn't Seem Too Fresh,"First,the good,the cameos,they may seem unimportant,but they're very cool and honor the past.The racing,it is a bit different,and I like how there is a lot more practical stunts than CGI.I liked that the races were part of the plot,and even though it wasn't the best,the plot did flow nicely.Some characters,like Han and Twinkie(yes that's his name)were decently acted and entertaining.The main character had a few good scenes as well.The best part is the new setting of Tokyo,it is very different and the movie does a good job of exploring the racing culture.Now,the bad,the characters,they aren't nearly as memorable as the originals,and aren't acted the best.The main character is pretty wooden,and the villain had a weak motivation and wasn't that threatening or entertaining,he was just an asshole.The action,it all feels the same,but it's still pretty good.The movie mainly suffers from being unmemorable.All in all,Tokyo Drift has good racing scenes and a nice setting,but it also has weak characters and isn't the most memorable,it probably should've been a direct to DVD movie.",jordansepticeye,2017-04-18,2017
10.0,"The best of ""Fast & Furious"" series","This movie is the best of all fast & furious series according to my view. The cinematography, the actor/actress all are great.

3.0,Cheese Fest!,"Where do i start? This movie is just an excuse to flaunt sexy cars and women. There is no real, believable plot. In the first half of the film, it's in too much of a rush to race and it's soooooo cheesy at the beginning when the blonde says ""The winner get's me"". OMG - i was sat in the cinema thinking - do i really have to sit through this!? But it did get better towards the end. I'll be it, I love the race's and beautiful cars (that's why i've given it 3 points) but it's not enough JUST to have that going for it.Okay, does it make sense that three of the main characters are American and one is Austrailian but it's all based in Japan? Maybe the ""army brat"" background could have been feasible for one, but i think they went a bit over the top. If you were going to cast American's as the main characters, base it in America! I hope that the producers decide that this is the last Fast and the Furious. The first two were great, it should have ended there with Paul Walker if you ask me.The ONLY thing i was really impressed with was the soundtrack.",SwampyMcDizzle,2006-07-06,2006
5.0,Essay on the movie,"If you're looking for an entertaining film with a little skin, a LOT of flash and burning rubber and actors who don't let actual acting ruin a good movie, this is something to watch, but if you want to know what I really think, read on. I watched ‘The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift’ tonight. I might disgust myself in writing about such a lousy movie, except I feel compelled to write about it because of the social message it advertises to the world's youth. I believe that what the world sees of America it sees through television and cinema, and that the America they see through those outlets is the America they hate, and though some parts of the movie were filmed in Japen, the film is distinctly American. ‘Tokyo Drift’ was, to a greater extent, a music video rather than a movie. There were prolonged periods of images set to music, which lacked dialogue of any kind to give the story forward motion. They showed the cars, beautiful cars, out-there cars you mightn't assemble for less than $100,000, if that. There were parking garages full of cars (most of these filmed in L. A., by the way), hundreds of them, and all accompanied by women clad in flash and tinsel, clothes that hid a minuscule amount of flesh, and yet probably cost more than your average head-to-toe overcoat. The film cameras gave no glance at any of their faces, filming solely from bust to mid-thigh. Do people notice this while they're watching, this type of socialization through homogeneity of setting? We're not surprised to see women in bikinis at a beach, but a like-clad woman standing on a crowded street corner will stop traffic. In this way, a movie-screen depicting dozens of women with few clothes becomes a type of visual background noise; it becomes normal. You don't see women dressed like this often, even in the swankiest clubs, yet, in ‘Tokyo Drift,’ the only woman's face you see long enough to memorize is the featured supporting actress, who, like everyone else, is beautiful. Everyone is good looking, fit and trim, and without ever lifting a weight or stepping into a gym. They party, sit and drive around, going through set after set of expensive tires they never seem to work to pay for. Who doesn't want this life? People watch this life, and they want to either replicate it or burn it down. One scene in particular exemplifies the hyper-reality of such a movie. A man, Han, drives donuts around a woman's car (both of which, the woman and the car, are gorgeous,) and does so in such a fashion that the woman gives Han her phone number without exchanging a single word with him. In this scene we've now reverted to the Cro-Magnon mating ritual. The ape pounds his chest to show his masculinity, and the female immediately gives in. This is fine for entertainment, except we're ignorant enough to believe that no one is ignorant enough to believe this. Advertising works, images empower actions, and the world watches, engendered to purpose. And what's with the drug dealers and racketeers all having friends? As if drug dealers and schemers can trust anyone enough to be their friend. Hyper-reality, which much of the outside world might take as truth, and which many of the world's youth (in Japan, India, Asia, and the Middle East) see as the way things ought to be, has some wonderful uses, but, at least in this case, has been used to display a reality sifted through a world of easy luxuriance that harms only those who abuse their luxuries. And if you're looking for an hour or more of cheap entertainment without having to lift a finger, it's there for you, but don't ever be tempted to take it as more than that.",cybertether,2007-03-05,2007
9.0,the fast and the furious tokyo drift,i give this movie a 9 out of 10.why?because this is one of the best movies the fast and the furious have ever made.i mean..sure..the fast and the furious and 2 fast 2 furious was better.but at least these people made an effort making us entertained! its useless if you just sit back there in your computer chair and just give people bad comments when they were the ones making an effort making this movie! don't diss people's movies when you cant even make a better one of your own!OK? god! this movie was actually good.it was outrageously action and it actually has a little bit of flavour in it. x] keep up the good work director dude!,lil_saint_izzy,2006-07-22,2006
5.0,not such a good movie,"well.. i saw the movie...i wasn't impressed... its not such a good one but the cars are great and the races was pretty good to(even if sometimes the races war too long and boring,my opinion).fans of the series will find lots to life in almost nonstop racing,lets hope that they will hear the don't try this at home:)). the other thing that i love about the movie was the soundtracks that fit great on the movie.it hasn't any known actors but u don't need celebrities to make a good movie.I'm not saying now that this is a good movie because is not.the dialogs are crappy (i wanted to reap my hair of my head every time when they start talking) and the movie doesn't have a story,but u can still watch it with some friends and have fun.i honestly think that the best Fast and Furious was the first movie.the one with Vin diesel.P.S>:if that kid in the movie its a minor that i will definitely become a pedophile:)))",elfishor,2006-08-24,2006
8.0,Good for what it stands for,"With a little bit of plot slippin and a little bit of ""NOS"" throughout ,the movie does it's main job: it entertains,it's got nice rides,nice chicks,little bit of action (not quite like it's predecessors) and makes way for a whole new generation.The acting part was ""nice"" considering the fact that the actors were all ""new"" to the very big and important big screen and the stunt-mans were great too.nice views of surroundings but could have been inserted more and the father-son relationship could have been a little bit more extended.all in all a nice-to-watch movie ,good for what it stands for.

4.0,"Same old, same old.","Even though at the time of the release of the first two movies I was part of the targeted audience group, I never have been impressed with any of the 'The Fast and the Furious' movies and that while I actually do enjoy cars and racing.Again, they attempted to make things a bit different again, by setting the movie in a different country and by starring new different actors in the leading roles. But really, it's just the same stuff all over again. They pretend as if the movie is all about drifting but in the end it's still a movie about street racing. A bunch of tough talking macho men hanging around with their pimped cars, not realizing what complete losers they actually are. They act as if racing and cool looking cars is all that matters in life and are even willing to put their lives at risk for it. What's even more disturbing is that in these movies always the lives of dozens of innocent bystanders also get threatened but the movie makes it seem like that's a cool thing.The whole scene like it gets portrayed in these movies is so totally ridicules and unrealistic. Why are all these nice looking girls hanging around with these guys every night in their party outfits? How do these hipsters who look like they never worked a day in their lives got all that money from for all those expensive looking cars? And why do they think that racing a car is the answer to every problem in life? Sorry, I just can't take the whole vibe of the scene and its atmosphere that the movie sends out.But no, that really isn't the biggest problem of these movies. I mean they still could really work out as hip and fun entertaining movies but yet so far the first three movies completely failed at this. It's not hard to see why; the stories are so disturbingly lacking.I think this movie even had the worst story out of three movies so far. Why even let the story take place in Tokyo in the first place? Seriously, this movie could had just as easily been set at any random American city. Just a marketing trick to make it seem as if this movie is being renewing and different from the other ones. But there also really isn't much good happening in the movie. Once you start analyzing it you see that all it is is some racing, than some hot girls again (I can't believe the amount of ass-shots in this movie. You should make a drinking game out of it) and then some more racing. This goes on and on, till the movie its end. I seriously wish there was some more substance to it and there actually was plenty of room and opportunity for that, with some of the movie its characters (the dad, the girlfriend, perhaps even with the Sonny Chiba character).The characters in this movie also form one major problem. There just isn't really likable enough and the movie is really lacking some star power behind it. Yes, believe it or not but this movie really could had uses some Vin Diesel or Paul Walker in it, as one of the main leads. I would had even gone for Tyrese but that's just because I wasn't that happy with Lucas Black, who talks like Jodie Foster and all he does is looking tough, without any acting behind it.The race sequence, what these movies are all about in the first place, just also didn't impressed me all that much. I often had a hard time figuring out what was going on because of the way it got shot and edited. I also kept on forgetting why they were racing in the first place, which was all because of its lacking and very uninteresting and unrealistic story.Really the worst out of the series so far. At least I think, cause I don't remember that much about the weak previous two.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Boba_Fett1138,2011-06-10,2011
10.0,mustang's new engine,"The engine in the mustang is not a RX-7 motor it is a 4cyc. out of a Silvia S15 this is the Japanese version of the 240SX both made by Nissan. And the motor would fit in the engine bay of the mustang. Other than that the movie was very very very good, but to all of those people out there who think drifting is easy, you are wrong, drifting is very hard a should NOT be attempted on the streets. Drifting is a motor sport which should be left on the track. this fast and the furious is the best yet, and if there are more to come i hope that the movie makers find a better way to keep the attention of the audience, because Tokyo drift was action from the start to the finish.",fireball138,2006-07-07,2006
3.0,Not the best of the lot,"Graphics were alright, but other than that it was pretty awful. Acting was pretty average, and the story line was a bit too cheesy. If I could, i would certainly go and get my money back, although I can't deny that the sound of the engines was nice to hear on the surround sound. The camera angles made the driving seem too easy, and just the whole idea of racing on the streets of Tokyo in the middle of so much traffic is just hard to swallow... Won't recommend that you go and waste the money in to watch in theaters, but it might be worth the watch on DVD if you have nothing better to do. I think i liked the second one the best out of the three F&F movies, but even that one wasn't worth paying, so you can probably guess how horrible the acting was.",Omarsolaija,2006-06-29,2006

3.0,very silly-please don't make a 4th,"The car racing scenes are all really over-the-top and down right silly. The drift racing they do would be impossible. Bama Boy, aka Sean, goes to Japan and just happens to find ""high school""(they look much older than high schoolers which is another glaring absurdity) kids into drift racing and he likes the girlfriend of the lead racer,DK. Of course, it is a set up for a final race at the end to prove who is better. This drift racing is so silly. It's like a car is gliding on ice. Then they go up this spiraling ramp to the top sideways. How silly can you get? And to make DK be involved with the mob also. When is it too much!FINAL VERDICT: Very lack luster. I loved the first movie. The second one was OK. But this was lousy.",MLDinTN,2007-04-30,2007
4.0,"A step up from it's predecessor, but this is still extremely dull stuff","The Fast and Furious franchise somewhat stalled with this third entry, which re-locates to the neon eye-candy of Japan in a desperate bid to avoid the tedium of the rest of the movie. The first sequel at least managed to keep hold of Paul Walker, who while wasn't the most gifted of actors in his tragically short career, he still had that Keanu Reeves-esque, beach-bum charm. Tokyo Drift stars Lucas Black, that rough-looking kid who was extremely impressive in Sling Blade (1996). His thick Southern drawl - rarely heard outside of an episode of The Simpsons - and goofy demeanour may make him a refreshingly different character to the meat-heads normally seen in this series, but he's just too damn convincing as a complete knuckle-head.After he lands himself in trouble totalling a car and demolishing a housing development in the process, Sean (Black) relocates to Tokyo to avoid a prison sentence, joining up with his military father. With the help of new high school friend Twinkie (Shad Moss, formerly known as Bow Wow), he finds the city's underground racing scene and quickly creates an enemy in yakuza D.K. (Brian Tee). D.K. challenges Sean to a race that involves 'drifting' - driving sideways at high speed around difficult corners. Sean is beaten, but fellow yakuza Han (Sung Kang) says he has character (thank God he told us) and invites him to join his gang to become a drift racer.It becomes a running (and unintentional) joke throughout the movie just how bad Sean is at everything he does. Han somehow sees a good driver in there, but all he seems to do is write off cars and wreak havoc. The complete charisma-void that is the film's hero is not helped by the film's awful script, and who knew there was so many Japanese men that speak English in an American accent? Nevertheless, it's a step up from 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003), and director Justin Lin infuses the action scenes with a bigger sense of reality, dragging the franchise back from the video game it was becoming. No one really gets hurt, but at least the cars get wrecked. Still, this is extremely dull stuff.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",tomgillespie2002,2015-01-11,2015
10.0,"""Shot in the arm of a dead series""","To those who've seen the previous installments of the Fast and the Furious series...welcome to the best of the bunch. Tokyo Drift actually takes what we remember from the previous two...and dumps it on its ears. The scenery, the acting...the overall story is a true step up compared to the previous movies.The story starts out in a typical American High school and introduces us to the films hero Sean. He has a lack of respect for authority and a love for speed, as shown in the accident that gets him sent to live w'his military father in Tokyo, Japan (hence the movie's name Tokyo Drift). Sean quickly learns of drift racing...or drifting as its come to be known, falls in w'the local racers and after a few learning experiences starts to gain the respect of the Japanese underground race scene. It all builds up to a great ending that outdoes anything in the previous two movies...and leaves the viewer wanting more.I am a fan of the series....I liked the original...absolutely hated the sequel(i wont even dignify it by saying its name)....and I truly loved pt. 3. Tokyo Drift is truly a shot in the arm of a dead and stale series. The locations and cars are a step up from the tired locals we've grown accustomed to in the previous installments. The storyline was a lot better done....the acting...well some people call this film the stand alone movie of the series...and it does stand alone..it can be viewed by itself or as a part of the trilogy w/very little loss to the story line, its the only film of the series to actually have some actors w'some acting chops..its the only film of the three that wasn't thrown together at the last min...and actually makes the viewer want to watch again.In short...if you haven't seen it...watch it...if u have seen it..re-watch it, Tokyo Drift actually makes you enjoy the sport of street racing...and puts back together very nicely what the previous film destroyed.",Holdenmagroyn,2008-01-27,2008
4.0,"Need for Speed the film, part 3","In 2001 The Fast and the Furious was released. Based around street racing for the most of the film and containing some bits about carjackers the film wasn't half bad. In 2003 the sequel was made. It wasn't half as good as the original. Now, in 2006, the third part is released and it is as bad as the 2nd one.In this part the story moves its background to Tokyo. The racing type goes from quarter mile to drifting, and the story is just as thin as the other two parts. It is still a film version of the Need for Speed games and I more or less expect the next part to have the racers score points by hitting police cars.It is a way to spend a bored Sunday afternoon, but nothing more than that and I wouldn't advise anyone to watch it - if you've never seen the first one I would suggest that one instead and if you have, just skip it.4 out of 10 very short skirts.",LazySod,2006-08-06,2006
10.0,Running in the 90's.,"Way better than the first two, though the lead actor had this mid-western accent which threw me off a little. Some of the drifting was unrealistic, but the storyline wasn't all hip-hop'd out with stupid walking styles and saying ‘breh’ and ‘brah’ at the end of every sentence. The Teriyaki boyz' theme song was good, the storyline was pretty good and the girls are hot of course. If anyone has seen the Initial D movie, then this movie is better than that one. There is a little love story kind of, but most of it is drifting action. Keiichi Tsuchiya (the real, one and only Drift King) makes an appearance in it as an old man fishing ‘You call that drifting?",blackdakkon,2006-06-17,2006
3.0,Sore Thumb of the Franchise,One of the worst acted movies that's not considered a children's movie that I've ever scene. The lead actor looks like it's his first time in front of a camera and the story is equally as bad. It's unclear what the problem to be solved in the story even is. It's clear they wanted to make a feud between Boswell and DK but weren't sure how to do that so they just concocted some story about Han taking money on the side. In the other Fast and Furious movies there is at least reason for the car chases. For this movie all they want to do is show you car chases and in order to do so they make up a feeble story in order to show you endless drifting. Clearly they are hoping that the viewer is just mesmerized by the drifting otherwise I can't see what there is to enjoy otherwise. Even the love interest between Boswell and Neela is awkward. You re told pieces of her story but in the end she's only used seemingly to be a piece to be gifted to the winner of the races. No doubt a demeaning role.The only role this movie serves is to give you some more time with Han and it at least fits with the ending of Fast 6.,ThereelscoopwithKK,2023-05-11,2023
1.0,"Awful, laughable, just lets the whole series down.","To begin with i'd like to say I'm a big fan of the fast and furious films.. all except for this one. I started watching this the other day (it was the only one I hadn't watched) and It just got worse and worse. The main actor is awful, he puts on this very unconvincing, annoying southern accent. (one particular line has stayed in my head for days) and generally walks around in a cringe-worthy way delivering poorly scripted lines or just popping his eyes at random girls.. it's awful. The plot makes no sense WHATSOEVER. I got halfway, becoming more and more incredulous and wondering what group of school-kids had written this before I verified the painfully obvious ending and turned it off. There's NOT EVEN GOOD RACE SCENES. you have to watch this idiot smash up nice cars that are just handed to him of course, but despite his awful driving for a reason NOT EXPLAINED he is DK's ‘Kryptonite’ Total trash..",gemma-iversen,2014-06-13,2014

3.0,"A few nice drifting scenes, that's about it","What can I say, this movie was just about everything I expected from it, totally predictable, not very good, and with some nice driving scenes but not enough to save this flick. The script is very typical indeed. New kid moves to the hood, gets into trouble with a gang, is interested in the gang leaders girlfriend, battles gang leader, wins, gets the girl. The same plot as all the other movies out there, but the implementation of that basic plot is not as good as other movies out there. The lead actor is annoyingly redneck American type, too stiff to be any good. Some parts of the racing scenes look fast-forwarded like 60's Batman or something. And why in the world do they have to drift all over the road when trying to drive as fast as possible?! That's just plain stupid.

Rebuilding a car from scratch in the final race, showing determination to the art of true race. Also its all about the Japan car culture and the crazy modified cars out there.

4.0,One Person Ruins the Whole Film,"The racing sequences and the entire concept of drifting elevate the Fast and the Furious franchise to a new level. Unfortunately, the casting of the protagonist in Tokyo Drift makes this film borderline unwatchable. Lucas Black does not look like a teenager, does not act like a teenager and is the opposite of what his character is supposed to be. Rather than a charming southern boy trying to find his way in Japan, Sean comes across as a creepy man-child too arrogant to respect those around him.I would only rewatch this film for one of two reasons: 1) To watch the epic drift race down the mountain (if only we could cut out the horrible, flip-phone huddled reactions) and 2) Han (easily one of the best characters in the entire F&F franchise). Justin Lin is better than this, which he goes on to prove with Fast Five and arguably the best episode of Community.",jace_the_film_guy,2021-07-16,2021

3.0,Throw off the timeline,"Justin Lin comes into the franchise here and, well, he has none of the original cast members coming back. So what do you do? Concentrate on the cars. Also, the chronological history of the story would change from here on out, with installments until 2015's Furious 7 being set between 2 Fast 2 Furious and this movie. Yes, you'd be shocked how confusing - and deep - these movies go. I watched all of them within a day or two, so I'm still amazed how we go from street gangs to the family basically being the G.I. Joe team. High school student Sean Boswell keeps getting arrested for street racing, so he is sent to live in Japan with his father. There, he discovers, well, street racing. Are you surprised? There he meets Twinkie (Bow Wow), who gets him in and he starts doing that Tokyo Drift, as they say. Sung Kang, who plays Han Lue, originated that role in Lin's movie Better Luck Tomorrow. He'd return in Fast & Furious, Fast Five, Fast & Furious 6 and Furious 7, as well as the short film Los Bandoleros, all set between the events of Better Luck Tomorrow and this movie. Han's explosive car crash was revisited in post-credits scene of Fast & Furious 6, which introduced Jason Statham's Deckard Shaw. Boswell would return in Furious 7, while he, Kang and Twinkie will all be back for F9. How is Kang still alive? We'll see. Following poor test screenings, Vin Diesel agreed to make a cameo as Dom in exchange for Universal's ownership to the rights of the Riddick series and character. No money exchanged hands. I'm always amazed at how canny Diesel is. This allowed him to make 2013's Riddick as an independent film. Also, of course Dom won in the race against Boswell. Come on.",BandSAboutMovies,2020-08-05,2020

8.0,I love drift,"""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" is a movie bomb. A completely different plot from the first 2 films with a story set in the future. The beauty of this movie is that you could also see it without watching the saga, although you would not understand the ending, which I really liked and has a crazy soundtrack. In my opinion the film really comes to life in its second part, the first is a bit more boring, the second is spectacular. Even here the characters are introduced very well: the best for me is Han, simple but essential, with a great interpretation of Sung Kang. I also liked D. K. with a great interpretation of Brian Tee and Twinkie of Bow Bow. One character that I never fully appreciated in all the visions of this film is Neela, she never gave me anything. The protagonist Sean has convinced me a lot and I can't wait to see him with Brian and Dom. The direction of Justin Lin in my opinion exceeds that of the first two chapters with many spectacular shots and has organized the film very well. In my opinion this is (compared to the first two films) the one with the best car races. I also liked the photography a lot. The most beautiful thing about this film are the soundtracks, unforgettable and perfect for the fantastic Tokyo setting. In my opinion this film, like the whole saga, is too underrated, these films are bombs and if they are seen to have fun and see the beautiful action scenes are masterpieces, stop. I never get tired of this movie, even if I've seen it five times..

4.0,Catch my drift,"Despite featuring none of the stars (but for a surprise cameo at the end) from the original films, this third instalment and its modest box office success convinced Universal Pictures that there was mileage in the Fast and Furious series.Director Justin Lin re-tooled the franchise, introduced the elements and a kinetic style that would carry on when Paul Walker and Vin Diesel return for the fourth part.Tokyo Drift has the southern drawl of Lucas Black who plays Sean Boswell a troublesome teenager regularly in trouble with the police. A disastrous drag race against a rich kid is too much for his mother who sends him to Tokyo to live with his father and attend high school there even though he does not speak a word of Japanese he apparently goes to a regular school rather than some international one.Before long Sean flirts with the girlfriend of DK (the drift king) who is the nephew of the Yakuza kingpin and falls in with the underground racing scene that features the skill of drifting.Sean starts to work for the mysterious hustler Han (Sung Kang) who teaches him how to drift and he ends up challenging DK for top dog status after a tragic accident.Although largely set in Japan the film still manages to have a multi ethnic cast and an urban soundtrack that the films have become noted for. However the story is thin, there are no outlandish heists or preposterous plotting. Lucas Black is just too blank as the lead and it is no surprise that the enigmatic Sung Kang was the more intriguing actor hence why he featured in the subsequent films.Do note that a crash scene was later retconned in the closing credits of Fast & Furious 6.The film has its flaws but it is also an important chapter in the creative team of Lin and Morgan. They would continue with the Fast & Furious films, bring back the original stars and makes this into one of the most profitable modern franchises around.",Prismark10,2016-07-08,2016

5.0,Ehhhh,This movie was not good not bad it was kinda boring watching it because it was the same thing over and over not much to say not worth the admission. If i was you i would tell your buddies unless they are hardcore car freaks or Fast and the Furious fans to just wait for this flop to hit DVD. The plot of the movie just was horrific if you ask me i mean this kid how old is he supposed to be in the first place? 27 34 18? I could not tell i mean he did not look like he belonged in a high school to me.

4.0,The low point of the franchise?,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift starts as teen troublemaker Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) gets into an illegal street race with a high school bully named Clay (Zachery Ty Bryan) who both end up crashing their cars. To avoid a jail sentence Sean is shipped out to Tokyo to live his father (Brian Goodman), during his first day at a Japanese school he befriends Twinkie (Bow Wow) & falls in love with Neela (Nathalie Kelley) who is the girlfriend of school bully D.K. (Brian Tee) whose uncle is a powerful Yakuza boss. As the two clash because of their cultures, backgrounds & Neela the only way the grudge can be settled & scores avenged is by a good old illegal street race where the winner takes all & the loser leaves Tokyo forever… This American German co-production was directed by Justin Lin & after watched the previous film in the series 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) mere hours before I can honestly say I think I was too hard on it since The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is even worse with even less going for it. For those bothering to keep count The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is in fact the third film in the bafflingly popular franchise that seems to exist purely to show of irresponsible people driving cars really fast, having lots of scantily dressed women in the background of as many scenes as possible & use awful Rap music whenever possible. Once again at over one hour & forty minutes long there just isn't enough plot here to fill the time so there are endless scenes of expensive & shiny looking cars screeching along or crowds of onlookers cheering which is just boring. While the previous two Fast and the Furious films mixed their vehicular based action scenes around some sort of thriller plot The Fast and the Furious: Toky Drift mixes it's high speed action with high school drama as Sean gets into trouble in Japan & at school, he gets in trouble with his father, with his classmates, with the Yakuza, with school bullies & even dates the wrong girl too. Of course as a character Sean is paper thin & nothing that happens to him will interest you at all, the rubbish script can't even throw in some decent action to liven things up so we have huge chunks of Sean & his personal problems taking up the majority of the films running time before the end when he manages to solve all of his problems in one go by winning an illegal street race, as you do. It seems everyone in Japan actually speaks English so Sean doesn't have much of a problem adapting. The whole gimmick here is that Tokyo is a pretty cramped city so all this drifting comes into play while racing, I already knew what drifting was since I have Need for Speed on my mobile phone(!) so I was right there in the moment straight away. I just knew what was going down right away, if you know what I mean. The action scenes aren't that great, again it just seemed like expensive looking cars screeching along the road more than anything else & the metaphor at the end with the American muscle car beating the slinky & stylish Japanese one has slight racist overtones. This may sound a bit sexist but the only real reason I have given The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift a half decent rating is because the Japanese girls on show in the background of many scenes dancing look hot, there are some seriously good looking birds on show here & I found it more enjoyable to look at the really hot Japanese girls than watch the film in general. Hey, I'm easily pleased, so sue me. Like the previous films the Rap music is awful & there's these odd bouncy pop songs that sound like they are sung by Japanese girls on helium, is this what Americans think the Japanese listen too? Although set mainly in Tokyo in Japan most of the film was shot in California. The acting is bad, Lucas Black as the anti authoritarian boy racer has no personality at all & is as wooden as they come, hell even Paul Walker wasn't as bad as this in 2 Fast 2 Furious. Bow Wow (does he sign cheques like that?) proves that Rappers should never act because they can't. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is even worse than 2 Fast 2 Furious which even surprised me, apart from a couple of half decent action scenes & lots of really hot looking Japanese girls this has nothing going for it. Followed by Fast & Furious (2009) which I presume explains Vin Diesel's cameo at the end.",poolandrews,2010-08-06,2010

5.0,Country boy in Tokyo?,"This is one of the weakest ones out of the sequence. I feel Lin should have found a better main actor for the leading part.1st of all, he was not a believable character and his Swag was not strong enough to flow with the script.We didn't get a chance to see the main actor really struggle through the movie in a way that he truly triumphs in the movie leaving you with a good feeling of closure at the end. It really feels that the Director was out of touch with the Authentecity of the script and just found warm bodies to fill the role.

5.0,"For all its flaws and bad qualities, Toyo Drift still has its own appeal that makes it stick out from the rest of the FF series","Tokyo Drift has terribly written characters with a halfway decent story. The film feels a bit dumb at times, but still, setting the story in Japan which complimented the vehicles and the nightlife of the characters was a good choice, there are groovy tunes, cool cars, and even cooler street races that makes up for all of the films flaws. The street races in particular are pretty good and is what I would consider to be Tokyo Drift's most redeeming quality. It is also the film from the Fast and Furious franchise that doesn't feel the need for viewers to have seen the other FF films to understand what's going on.In short, dumb but fun.",CasuallViewer,2021-02-14,2021
4.0,For me the film is an average movie,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is an action film directed by Justin Lin and stars Lucas Black, Bow Wow, Nathalie Kelley, Sung Kang, and Brian Tee.The movie is third installment of Fast and Furious series.The film is based on the life of teenager who is sent to Japan in order to avoid jail term is again being caught in between the drift racing.This is probably one of the most script-less film i have seen and it seems that the film is being made on the whims and fancies of the writer and director.The protagonist who is sent to Japan is being enrolled in school but i haven't seen him attending him any single class apart from only once scene of the school. From here the movie goes into predictable mode.The screenplay of the movie is decent but for me the movie was predictable and doesn't have anything new to offer.Acting was average and none of the character was memorable.

4.0,The inevitability of this franchise is nigh,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift opens with a sequence so breakneck and fast-paced it may give you whiplash. Set in sun-soaked Arizona, it opens by focusing on local boy Sean Boswell (Lucas Black), who is being teased by a typical high school jock for his ragtag vehicle while he proudly boasts a blood-red Viper. Sean is prepared to drive away after delivering a zinger, but instead nearly takes a wrench to the jock's vehicle after he throws a stone and breaks a window on Sean's car. The jock's girlfriend suggests the two settle it out in a race in a property development community where the winner, she says, will ""win me"" as their prize. Ho ho.Sean and the jock agree to the bet and endure a breathless four minute long race that is so American in what it does; everything from fast cars, to stereotyped characters, to the aching masculinity are profiled in this opening scene, which does indeed circumvent to a greater moral when the race is over and the characters are badly maimed in the hospital; these street-racing incidents are illegal for a reason and often result in serious accidents.Sean's mother cannot afford this latest escape, which has Sean's car totaled and his life in jeopardy now that he is about to be imprisoned on prior street-racing charges before he's even eighteen. As a result, she sends him to live with father, who is stationed in Tokyo and a part of the U.S. Navy. Sean meets Twinkie (Bow Wow), the only black guy to be found in Japan, who introduces him to Tokyo's underground street-racing scene which, unlike most American races, is predicated upon the vehicular art of drifting. For those unschooled, drifting a vehicle is performed on a sharp turn, which puts all the emphasize of control and handling on one particular side of the car, resulting in a tire-screeching and, if done correctly, slick method of completing a difficult turn without one losing control of the vehicle or losing too much speed in the process. I've done it with friends on a snow-covered parking lot; it's as fun and as exhilarating as it sounds.If you can't drift in Tokyo, you're worse than a loser - you're an outsider, and early in his stay, Sean meets Takashi (Brian Tee), Tokyo's well-respected Drift King, along with his girlfriend Neela (Nathalie Kelley). Sean impulsively decides to race Takashi, but because he has no conception of drifting, he loses miserably on a course made up of tight turns and many opportunities for close calls. In order to prevent embarrassment the second time around, Sean calls on street-racer Han Seoul-Oh (Sung Kang) for assistance, in order to eventually beat Takashi and avoid getting caught up in dirty underground business.The Fast and the Furious movies have taught me a lot in just three fairly breezy installments, but I would've never guessed how much could be obtained and how many problems could automatically evaporate thanks to slick vehicle tricks and street races. Enemies often turn to close friends, a laundry list of felonies are expunged off records, drug lords are stopped, mass respect is earned, nationalities come together, and globalization is achieved. I may be going too far off the deep-end with the last two, but keep in mind I have four more films to tackle, so these can be seen as early predictions of impact.The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, however, doesn't have the charisma of its predecessors, nor does it have Rob Cohen's hand for flashiness nor John Singleton's assured hand at balancing chaos. Justin Lin interjects the kind of dizzying action I was hoping these films would avoid, and the characters here feel like further developed archetypes similar to how 2 Fast 2 Furious's loud mouth character Roman Pierce (Tyrese Gibson) thrived on smart-ass comments. For all the brooding Lucas Black does here, very little emits any character development or likability (at least Paul Walker had his coolness and his wit to back him up), and Bow Wow is laughably flat as the token black character who has to teach the outsider the ways of the streets.Screenwriter Chris Morgan's decision to take the franchise in a different direction is an admirable one, but also perhaps too soon for its own good. The second film didn't focus on Vin Diesel's Dom character, nor did it really emphasis the kind of believable, common-man quality of all the racers and street-races in the first film. The inevitability of the Fast and the Furious franchise is it succeeded the first couple times because it emphasized a wee bit of plausibility in its schemes, however, monstrous box office success for an action film will always lead to sequels trying to push boundaries and up the dosage of chaos in each successor of the franchise.While Tokyo Drift doesn't get too crazy, it's still never quite as fun, especially being that the people involved in these races aren't particularly likable, and outside of a fairly strong, if unabashedly silly, opening scene, there's little merit to the third outing save for a special cameo by someone we've waited too long to see anyways.Starring: Lucas Black, Bow Wow, Brian Tee, Nathalie Kelley, and Sung Kang.

8.0,Better than 1 and 2,"It's easy to beat 2, so that isn't saying much. However, in my mind it is even better than the first. Neither necessarily has a great storyline, though number 1 had the most likely one. However, where the first one failed, Tokyo Drift delivers.People don't go see movies like this for substance and content. They go to see cars race. Autophiles and racers go to see the tricked out cars and hear the names of their suppliers being used on the big screen. The first installment in this series used a lot a jargon unknown to non to non-racers, and to those who were in the know, the movie was a joke. Tokyo Drift gets away from all the pretenses and delivers what the truth is: few people use Nitrous Oxide, and racers drive because they love it, money or none, just to see who is the best.The cars are great. It was wonderful too see the makes and models you are used to seeing out there, instead of all these tricked out high priced rice racers. The best cars to race aren't necessarily the most expensive. The racing was more about skill than power, and that's the truth. First off the line means jack if you don't know your wheels. The racing scenes are top notch. Gone are the shaky camera angles and digitally enhanced shots of cars flying by at 140mph with nitrous in full bore. Instead, we get cool shots using cell phones, and up close angles of vehicles gliding across pavement and narrowly missing the camera. The action shots are wonderful, and many are real shots, not computer digitized as referenced by the end credits begging us not to go out and attempt these stunts that were performed on closed roads by professional drivers. We're not talking your standard danger tag, we're talking full size text on it's own screen. These drifters are for real, and that just enhances the feel for the film.Finally, and parents will love this, it is relatively clean. I don't think i heard a single f-bomb in the whole movie. I'm not saying that there is no cussing, but that it is so moderate and background oriented, that you can watch the movie and not even remember hearing it. There are about 5 or 6 kissing scenes, and only one contains a semi-main character. The worst content you will see here is skimpy outfits.This is just a fun, fun movie. It's not going to win any awards, but it has definitely set itself up to top the original in box office gross and will no doubt surpass 2 fast 2 furious. Don't be afraid to take the 13+ kidding to see this, though under 8-10 may be pushing it, unless they really understand cars and racing.",deac0n_fr0st,2006-06-17,2006
4.0,Worst in the hexology,"While the actors in this ""movie"" give un-noteworthy performance, sans Sung Kang, the rest of them only ""succeed"" at delivering lines. They do not emote or act engaging with one another. Were they interacting with blue/green screens ? I'm inclined to believe so. Black's ""drawl"" sounds like he tried his version instead of a dialect coach's. Or that's how he believes all ruralites speak. The ""story"" is neither plot or character driven, Tee is far from intimidating with his soft Jack Palance/ Steven Seagal emulation. Unless he was inspired from Mike Tyson for his role. Neela's Australian accent is inconsistent, and Lin seemed more tuned into action and cinematography. Another thing was why Han died, and as a consequence; Lin had to plug the inconsistencies with the sequels. Han has mentioned in 4 and 5 about Tokyo. Obviously, no foresight into what's entailed if you're trying to explain why a character croaked in three more movies. Furthermore,where this one had no trace of story, the next two tried to substantiate that. Which doesn't hold water. Also, if Sean commits a petty offense in Tokyo, how could that possibly incriminate him in the U.S.? Does jurisdiction exist in this universe ? How can high schoolers afford such high end cars ? Are they all in collusion with the Yakuza ? I'll tell you something else: If you sacrilegiously stab a import motor into a classic domestic, you'll go to hell where Hitler is admiring Ford.",nvjs,2013-03-18,2013
5.0,"Women, yakuza and engines!","Tokyo Drift does not deny itself about the main character of the story, a disbanded boy. The story focuses on clandestine races, skirmishes with the mafiosi on duty and the inevitable love story between the protagonist and the beauty of the group. The result of a simple frame for spectacular drifting rides. The budget of the film, which however turns out to be quite high, has therefore served mainly for three things: special effects, luxury cars and to pay a small cameo by Vin Diesel. The direction is excellent, with shots that impeccably emphasize the action scenes, but it must be admitted that even at the current state of affairs manages to break the monotony of the series, which had seen the protagonists always and only run on classic American tracks, so abused as to be unattractive for the viewer.",il_criticone,2023-10-07,2023
8.0,Tokyo Racing,"The ""Fast and Furious"" dilogy in the early 2000s became a kind of canon for fans to see cool pumped cars with bright neon lighting. Drive, powerful soundtrack, interesting story - all this was present in the films with Paul Walker. And it was surprisingly unusual to realize that the third part would focus on completely different characters, and even on the other side of the Earth. At first, I observed myself a certain rejection in this regard to this project. However, after just a couple of dozen minutes, the plot is addictive, and the picture is fun to watch.""Tokyo Drift"" undertakes to tell about the nightlife of the capital of Japan, where the main character arrives. And even if he is still a high school student, the guy joins the nightlife of the metropolis, where there is also an underground world of beautiful tuned cars. The picture, however, focuses not on speeds, as it was in previous paintings, but on drifting, when craftsmen manage to drive not only fast on small sites, but also fit into turns, sending their cars into a controlled skid. It was a fresh trend of the film, it was shown in an interesting and tasteful way. However, this does not mean that nothing has been prepared here for fans of racing through the dark streets of the city. Such things are necessarily in store from the creators, and the tricks are performed at the proper level.The screenwriters did not invent something extraordinary in terms of the plot, habitually placing the protagonist in new living conditions for him, where he will have to make his way to the very top, be sure to get a powerful opponent and of course get a passion. The film is unlikely to present any surprises in the course of the plot, but in general the picture looks very cheerful, not allowing the viewer to lose interest in what is happening on the screen. The film catches, probably, in another way: a good video next to it and an ultramodern soundtrack that successfully fits into the corresponding scenes.The work of the whole team is impressive. On the screen we see the actors, their vicissitudes, but much in the film depended on the stuntmen and stunt directors. The guys did a great job, giving a really driving action for all fans of this genre.""Tokyo Drift"" turned out to be a good ""Fast and Furious"". Other, unusual - this is a fact. But after a couple of films in the series, viewers will realize that this is quite an interesting part of the overall franchise, and this picture has only expanded the edges of a huge world with a lot of heroes and villains for us. And they did it quite worthily.8 out of 10.",alekspredator87,2022-12-14,2022

His Mum should have left him to go to jail, then we could all watch him become some enormous blokes sex toy. That'd be a better story too. The character is so annoying that it even degenerates into his 'look'.

10.0,Favorite film of the franchise,"The original The Fast and The Furious was the Point Break of street racing movies. The film was so popular and well-received that it has spawned a bunch of sequels and offshoots. At this point almost 20 years later, it's kind of gotten out of hand. The franchise is now less about street racing and more about crazy superhuman stunts and world-ending subplots, basically James Bond with flying cars. It's pretty silly now. But, for my money, the first 3 movies of the franchise are ace. While the stories are pretty good, at their very core, the original trilogy of movies are about speed and the adrenaline rush of the race. And I'm probably one of the very few people on the planet whose favorite FnF movie of the franchise is this this third one THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS:TOKYO DRIFT (2006). Tokyo Drift is a simple fish out of water tale and the hero in this one is neither Brian nor Dom, but an outlier in the series high school student Sean Boswell (excellently played by Lucas Black), a troubled rebel loner who gets into trouble in the States in the film's opening sequence, as Sean takes part in a thrilling street race against the school bully (Home Improvement's Zachery Ty Bryan in a cameo role). The two boys are dueling over the bully's girlfriend and end up tearing up a bunch of property during their race. To keep Sean out of trouble, his mother ships him off to Japan to live with his estranged, stern father (well played by Brian Goodman). During his first day at his Tokyo high school, Sean struggles to fit in and is shown the ropes by fellow American Twinkie (played by rapper Bow Wow in a scene stealing performance), who hustles all kinds of products to make money. Sean also meets Neela (a stunning Nathalie Kelley), a beautiful Australian import who's lived in Tokyo since childhood. As Sean attempts to woo Neela, he meets resistance from her boyfriend DK (played with appropriate menace by Brian Tee), a local thug and nephew of the most powerful gangster in Tokyo. Sean and DK get into a race over Neela...sound familiar? They race in a high rise parking garage where DK easily schools Sean in this first encounter as Sean doesn't know how to ‘drift’ his car, a special technique that allows the driver to smoothly manipulate sharp curves while still maintaining complete control of the vehicle and stay in a race. The car that Sean damaged was owned by Han (confidently played by Sung Kang), a rich and mysterious player in Tokyo who seems to have a history as deep as his pockets. So Han decides to take Sean under his wing and have him perform special jobs for him to pay him back for the damaged car. During their joint venture, Han shares wisdom with Sean, while at the same time Twinkie helps Sean navigate the streets of Tokyo. Eventually, the trio come together as Sean, Twinkie and their crew including funny duo of non-talking side characters Earl and Reiko teach Sean how to drift so he can eventually have a final showdown with DK. Tokyo Drift is easily the most entertaining movie of the entire series telling the cliche underdog rebel story with energy, flair and humor. The cast plays well off each other. I find the Sean-Han dynamic to be just as engaging as the Dom-Brian one from the original film. And the movie never slows down. Even the heavy dialogue scenes are good. The scenic, eye-popping Tokyo setting is a welcome contrast to the more grungy American locales of the first 2 movies. Tokyo Drift is an anomaly where the 3rd film in a series may actual be the best of the lot.",hnt_dnl,2020-05-30,2020
5.0,"This one is a little much, and deviates too much from the original","I like how they tried to tell a new story within the Fast and the Furious franchise, but this one goes a bit too far in trying to deliver on the action without the story to back it up. It just isn't the same with the main character being more of a loner than someone who teams up and is all about family. The cars aren't as good, the acting isn't as good, the story isn't as good. It is a fun watch if you are just looking for driving and action, but it doesn't go much further than that. It is still a big enough part of the franchise to put ""Tokyo Drift"" into our vernacular probably forever, but the re-watch of this one doesn't warrant a very high rating when compared to some other movies in the franchise.",jaredlemin,2025-01-09,2025
8.0,The fast and the furious: Tokyo drift,"Got a free screening pass to see it 6-12, saw it with some car buddies, the dork I am took notes.This movie had more semblance of a plot than the rest of the franchise, the action stayed fresh and actually flowed with the plot, and the characters actually had motivation this time! There weren't any HUGE glaring inaccuracies (other than daddy throwing sonny the keys to a car with NO ENGINE in it...) The three cameos in the film were well placed, though a bit campy at the very end. The cars and action sequences were amazingly choreographed, one even leaving my whole theatre clapping for the protagonist.I give 8/10 because of low expectations, and being totally blown away when it was much better than I expected.",dineshaishu,2019-07-29,2019
4.0,Good if not better than the original Fast and the Furious,"Following the box-office financial success of 2 Fast 2 Furious, another sequel was already planned for a release in the summer of 2006. So now I move on to the third film, but is chronologically the sixth film in the series as it is the film to take place before Furious 7, ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"".I won't explain the whole plot, but here is a quick summary: A teenager named Sean Boswell becomes a major competitor in the world of drift racing after moving in with his father in Tokyo to avoid a jail sentence in America.The story is a little bit incoherent, but this is ""The Fast and the Furious"", so I will keep this review very short.Needless to say, I love ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"". It has a great story, great action, a good musical score and darn good performances from the cast.The action is really top-notch. The car chases was very intense and much reckless this time around because this had some reckless behavior in this film, so this is why the movies have a PG-13 rating. This film did have a scene where a character named Han-Seoul Oh dies in a car crash, which we see again in the later two films, ""Fast and Furious 6"", which was released in 2013 and ""Furious 7"" in 2015. But in the sixth film, it was revealed that Owen Shaw's brother, Deckard Shaw, killed him and blew up his car. That was just sad and a little scary to see.The car chase at the beginning of the film was a little disturbing to watch because after the two boys race each other over a girl, they are all shown with blood on their faces. Han is also shown with blood on his face, but that doesn't stop me from liking or reviewing this movie.The acting is really great. Lucas Black plays the role of Sean Boswell, the main character, and Black would play the part of Sean Boswell in the seventh film in the film franchise, Furious 7. Bow Wow plays the role of Twinkie and he does an okay performance, but he is also in the seventh film using archival footage.Sung Kang plays the role of Han Seoul-Oh and he would play that role for the next three films in the franchise. He does an incredible job with the dialog written for him.Nathalie Kelley plays the role of Neela, who is Takashi's boyfriend, but has romantic feelings for Lucas Black's character and she does a darn good job in her performance. Brian Tee as Takashi / Drift King just drove me crazy. He is the perfect villain and his performance is very dark and serious. Tee as Takashi / Drift King just really creeped me out when the first scene with him shows.The only character to return from the previous entry, which was the first film, titled The Fast and the Furious, which was released in June of 2001 is Dominic Toretto, played by Vin Diesel as he agreed to make a cameo in the film in exchange for Universal's ownership to the rights to his Chronices of Riddick franchise and character, in lieu of financial payment. The musical score composed by Brian Tyler is just amazing and he would compose music for the fourth film, titled Fast & Furious, the fifth film, titled Fast Five and the seventh installment, which is just titled Furious 7. He blends the musical instruments together in this spectacular musical score.The direction by Justin Lin was bad but I really liked it and the script was written by Christopher Morgan and he really does an incredible job with an amazing dialog and is very cool.Overall, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is as good if not better than the first film, while there are some major flaws, it is still enjoyable and I still think this is watchable. For people who liked the first two and hated this one, watch it again and you will find a darn good story.",joshuadrake-39480,2015-04-23,2015
4.0,A third Fast film that for me is a let down,"Drifting is a strange kind of racing, one that could if given its chance be very nicely done and fun to watch, unfortunately this film although giving it a good go fails to capture that incentive. Yes Fast and Furious movies don't get more random than this, a complete off shoot with a plot not wholly predictable but still just downright basic. My problem with this lies very much in the hands of the director Justin Lin whose reckless directing of a well, reckless movie makes this just too poor to be even OK. Our story is set in Tokyo of course, a young man by the name of Sean Boswell is sent to live with his father in the city because he is one bad kid apparently. Boswell is a bit obsessed with racing, something that puts him at odds with his father but also gets him into trouble at times with the local gangs. The plot was just too average to be anything more, tired old lines about racing very quickly extinguish any skill the movie may have, and that's not to mention the horrible way in which it is directed. Justin Lin is not on any form here whatsoever, he does nothing to make this better nor explore the script for any actual differences between this and what has been done before, I won't doubt the race scenes and some stunts, but his work in the more serious moments is just downright bad. As for the actors well it is really quite a mixed bag, some are poor some are OK with no one ever really reaching heights. Sung Kang is for me the best actor here, calm is the name of the game when it comes to him and I felt the scenes in which he(as the character of Han) is in, are much better than others. Boswell is portrayed by Lucas Black and he is very bland, not really bad but just doesn't do a lot, I felt it was quite a strange choice of main character. Cast such as Bow Wow make it slightly more fun but don't add much at all to the story, in the end the actors have to ride a long on a plot too dumb to be positive. I did however enjoy the style of the movie, in fact for parts of this engagement levels can be high, but for others not so much. It did feel to me the kind of flick which could at one part be sending you to sleep and the next be getting you pumped up; I think it is Lin yet again who is the cause of the more dull moments. Chris Morgan writes this and does a job I can only describe as under par, the screenplay is not well made, doesn't completely fall flat but still has those lines I mentioned which are just old and stale and have no place in films over and over again.Would I watch it again?, well maybe not because I didn't like it pure and simple, not the kind of movie I had deep dislike and definitely not hate but still a certain degree of disappointment. I think fans of the series up to the point of this film if you are indeed a fan of the first two will enjoy this, I can't see this topping their lists but still has that style again and the music and clothing to match them as well. Overall The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a bit of a waste, a missed opportunity to fully explore the Japanese racing scene and all it has to offer, instead bringing us the same old kind of stuff we are used to and that for me makes this a let down.",willcundallreview,2015-08-29,2015
10.0,Maybe Best One So Far!,"This movie is SO good. All the actors, even though most not being actually Japanese really played their parts well. The cars were really cool. There was humor in the movie which is always good. The movie also has depth. And the new actress playing Neela is SO pretty.Apart from maybe one or two scenes where the depiction of underground Japanese society seems inaccurate (I wouldn't know, just seemed more like American society), I really really liked the movie!! My boyfriend even said that it may even be better than the first two.I recommend this movie to seriously anyone who likes cars, who likes seeing pretty chicks, who gets adrenaline rush from racing and whoever just wants to watch a seriously awesome movie. =P",k4j_4eva,2006-06-21,2006
3.0,I nearly drifted away several times.....,"After totalling his car in a street race, Shaun Boswell is sent to live with his father, in Tokyo, to avoid jail. While in school, he befriends Twinkie, who introduces him to the world of racing in Japan. Forbidden to drive, he decides to race against the ‘Drift King’, who has ties to the Yakuza, but loses, totalling the car because of his lack of knowledge of drifting, racing that involves dangerous turns. To repay his debt, he enters the underground world of drift street racing. As he becomes better and better, he must finally prove his worth in that world by once again racing The 'Drift King'.... The mind boggles that this franchise went from strength to strength after two really lethargic, unleaded sequels. The second was bad enough, but at least it had Walker in it. This however, has some guy who looks like an anorexic Josh Duhamel, trying to give it the Swagger that the original cast had, but failing miserably. But not only that, he has Lil' Bow Wow, or whatever you call him now as company, doing the best impression of Glenn Plummer in Speed. Tokyo looks great though, and we have a special guest star come the end, but its a really poor movie, empty and shallow, much like an ex-girlfriend of mine....",FlashCallahan,2014-05-05,2014
8.0,They finally got it RIGHT the third time around!!!,"As much as the first two were entertaining...the improbabilities were overflowing;What were the odds that everyone and their mother behind the wheel in these movies drove like the bastard children of Mario Andretti?Could the United States, in all its glory and splendor, be the only country to master the ultimate concept of street racing?Is a trigger finger on the ""spray"", or NOS, all that is needed to make one a champion?Following a special screening of this movie, I believe that the film revitalized the entire franchise.You will meet the main character. In one was or another you will identify with him; whether it is trying to help others, but getting in trouble yourself, or simply trying to fit in within a culture that scorns your very existence as an outsider.You will see what the other end of the world has to offer on the concepts of style, sex, and of course, racing and its philosophy.You will witness what this subculture of street-racing can bring with it; respect, envy, greed...even the ultimate sacrifice.It is these which the first two movies lacked, but is what the third installment surely supplies.Enjoy the film!!!",jr_dread,2006-06-13,2006
4.0,Could of been better,"The first thing that would make this movie better is different actors. Have that country boy in this one just ruins the movie. He can't fight or anything he is just all talk. I can understand for the location the film was supposedly made in and everything, but pick different music. You can't understand one word they yodel or anything. What was the point in adding a Volkswagen with with fist for chow wow anyways. It's not even a sports car. Even if I lived where this movie was made I would never where those bedroom shoes he had to wear in class. Why did they have Vin diesel at the end of the movie when nothing else starts off where the movie ended at in the first place? Who would actually eat the food they chose for this anyways? It looked like colored marshmellows and vegetables with some other weird looking things.",Jeremy_brewer1,2012-02-12,2012
5.0,A Different Type of Street Racing,"Constantly in trouble due to illegal racing, a high school senior named ""Sean Boswell"" (Lucas Black) is sent to live with his father who is in the military and stationed in Japan. When he gets there he immediately gravitates to a group of other students his age who are also involved in racing fast cars. However, because of the limited space in Tokyo the sport has changed to one that involves negotiating extremely tight corners in either an underground parking garage or a narrow road along the side of a mountain. The problem Sean has is not only that he is not used to this type of racing-known as drift racing--but also that his main rival is an arrogant punk named ""Takashi"" (Brian Tee) who is extremely jealous whenever his girlfriend, ""Neela"" (Nathalie Kelley) even looks at another guy. And there is some definite chemistry between her and Sean. It also doesn't help that Takashi thinks he can do whatever he wants because his uncle, ""Kamata"" (Sonny Chiba) is a high-ranking member of the Yakuza. One other problem is that Takashi is also extremely good at drift racing. In any case, with all of these areas of disagreement it is only a matter of time before Sean and Takashi have it out and when they do the stakes will be very high. Now, rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie certainly had some good moments here and there. Unfortunately, there were some scenes which were a little over-the-top and which caused the film to seem a bit uneven. That being the case, I rate this movie as about average and recommend it only to those who might enjoy a film of this type.",Uriah43,2017-01-16,2017
10.0,Sweet,"this is a sweet movie!!! If you like rice and even some American muscle, it is a must see. Lots of action, girls,girls,girls, and rice, rice, rice. Makes the first two movies look stupid. If you saw the first two movies, you need to see the third. Drifting is definitely better suited for a movie. Lots of turbo action, and not much NOS. this movie brings back the idea that not every person can get behind the wheel of a car and race like no tomorrow. If you go see this and expect it to be anything like the first two, your in for a good surprise. if you like Evo VIII's RX-8 and fast fast cars all done up custom you'll like this movie. I think i'm gonna have to go see it at least one more time.",josmialo,2006-06-16,2006
5.0,Feels like more of an inferior spin off but better than one might think,"The Fast and the Furious franchise are a good action franchise but it's not Die Hard. The movies have had their ups and downs and the series has yet to gain a 5 star instalment. This slightly odd threequel is the second worst, but not a terrible movie. A random new street racing protagonist goes to Tokyo, where despite the threat of going to prison he carries on street racing. Aside from Vin Diesel's cameo, this is only really a F&F movie in the sense that you can expect a ton of car porn, lots of street racing and a general lack of respect for the authority, the settings which often get trashed by the racers and critics. There's a good reason why the 5th film went into heists instead. The street racing was always pretty tedious. This has more racing than any other instalment. The first race is fun, but by the climatic race you'll be bored as the film seems to be on autopilot. Also, there's quite a bit of jarring CGI in the finale. Han's death scene is the most effective moment of the film, mainly due to its clever reappearance in later films. This delivers what you want and expect. Good action scenes, likable characters and an irresistible sense of just not caring. There are plenty of thrills to be had and there are some action highlights, although the scenes with the protagonist's father, various sexist jokes and too many scenes which will only interest a specific audience let the film down. The main character is OK but a little bit of a blank. The villain is a let down as well. However, the Tokyo settings provide some visual delight and it's nice to move away from the American setting for a change. Justin Lin does a good job behind the camera and directs the movie smoothly. In general, this is fairly average street racing fare. It certainly won't get the critics talking much and will connect far more with fans of the genre, although that's the case with many blockbusters. I wasn't that bothered about this in the end. It's OK, but without Paul Walker and Vin Diesel (Even if Vin Diesel is sometimes extremely annoying) this doesn't feel so much like Fast & Furious. 5/10",Rickting,2015-05-05,2015
10.0,Lucas Black is a hit in new Fast and Furious flick,"I enjoyed watching this new movie of The Fast and The Furious. Lucas Black seemed to capture the spotlight in the movie. His character's background was entertaining. The ending is unexpected, but INTERESTING.Great movie.The only disadvantage of the movie is the storyline seems to drift off occasionally. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone that is into fast paced movies and also into the auto aspect. Nicer cars compared to the first to movies. No subtitles, which makes the movie, slightly confusing but you'll get the gist of it all.The trailer didn't do the movie any justice. It has a slight father & son bonding moment, brings some moments to heart.",sprtsmedchik,2006-06-20,2006
4.0,Someone thought that all you needed was cars and babes,"I can suspend my disbelief if needed. But it's just not possible for this movie.If the main character had any real charisma maybe I could like the movie more. But his character is annoying.If the movie had something resembling an interesting plot, maybe I could like the movie more. But it doesn't.The dialog is rock bottom. They go to some underground car scene and this dude throws a box of Kleenex at the main character (who I hate so much, I can't recall his name.) Some high school kid carries Kleenex in the car? And he says 'This is for when you blow your load'. That's about the level of dialog in the movie.The cool cars, and there are some damn cool cars, and female scenery are nice enough, but they can't save this movie.As for the story, it's less believable than a fairy tale. 1) This kid can't even drive at the start of the movie - at least they should have shown crazy-talent in the first race, so we could believe he can succeed later. It's not like this is a martial arts movie where we expect zero to hero in one lesson. 2) People let this unknown guy race their cars?! 3) All these high school kids own these seriously expensive cars?That's just scratching the surface. There's worse movies. Like Red Line (worst car movie ever maybe.) But not many.",michaeljhuman,2013-08-16,2013
5.0,The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,"This was the third film in the non-stop high octane franchise full of cool and fast cars racing and chasing each other, including lots of action and some stunts along the way, directed by Justin Lin (Fast & Furious, Fast Five, Fast & Furious 6). Basically Sean Boswell (Jarhead's Lucas Black) is a teenager and school student in Alabama who has got into trouble too often and has a record for illegal high speed street racing, so his mother sends him to live with his father, U.S. Navy Lieutenant Boswell (Brian Goodman) in Tokyo, Japan to avoid time in prison. Sean ends up in a cramped apartment in a low-rent section of the city, in his new school he befriends fellow American and ‘military brat’ Twinkie (rapper Shad 'Bow Wow' Moss) who introduces him to the world of the drift racing scene in Japan. Though forbidden from driving, Sean competes in deadly speed races with heart stopping courses of hairpin turns and switchbacks, taking on ‘Drift King’ D.K. (Austin Powers in Goldmember's Brian Tee), who has connections to Japanese organised crime syndicate the Yakuza. Sean grows in presence and his talent for drifting, but he is getting close to the Japanese mafia, thousands of dollars are coming into play, but also his life is in stake, eventually he is able to escape the crime underworld, and allowed to stay in the country to continue his passion for racing. Also starring Sung Kang as Han, Nathalie Kelley as Neela, Zachery Ty Bryan as Clay, Caroline de Souza Correa as Isabella, Keiko Kitagawa as Reiko, Shin'ichi Chiba / JJ Sonny Chiba as Uncle Kamata and a cameo from Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto. This is the only film of the franchise without either Diesel or Paul Walker, so it feels odd, but Black is reasonably good as the bad boy teenager influenced by the drifting craze, the rest of the cast are fine as well I suppose. To be honest, the storyline going on is not the thing to pay the fullest attention to, it is the pedal-to-the-metal stuff, all the colourful and cool cars fuelled up, with extra rocket boosters and switches, that speed and crash their way around, and the explosions and stunts along the way keep the pace up as well, it taking place in Tokyo only adds loads of neon light filled sequences, it slows down mid way and only picks up a little towards the end, but all in all it's an alright action thriller. Worth watching!",jboothmillard,2009-12-07,2009
8.0,The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,"I've said it before and I'll say it again...this is the best darn Fast n Furious chapter on the track by miles (puns away!). No big names and no massive overblown stunts, this is just pure driving at its finest, real driving, drift driving. The film works because there is no pressure on its shoulders, the sequel was terrible so there were no expectations here. Now I know this has been long forgotten by the recent tidal wave of cookie cutter sequels and merely because Vin Diesel came back, but none of them hold a candle to this. The plot is basic and involves a young tearaway who seems to be getting into trouble where ever he and his mother move to. One stunt too many causing major damage to property and writing off his car means he's being sent away to his father...in Japan. His father was in the military so this is why he's based in the land of the rising sun, and because of his bad record (and to avoid jail) this young lad gets shipped to Japan to live with his dad. That's a punishment!!? sounds pretty cool to me. Of course the entire plot is predictable and hokey as hell, its virtually bordering on 'The Karate Kid' with cars. New kid in town, makes a close friend who helps him, makes enemies with the local bully cos he falls for his girlfriend, gets into all sorts of scrapes in the meantime, his father can't control him...blah blah blah, yeah its damn unoriginal sure, but that's not why we watch these films is it. It is a shame the main lead in this is totally miscast, he looks like a doofus and sounds it too with that hick southern accent of his, but mainly he's just not much of a good looking lead, strange choice. You like Japanese super saloons? more specifically you like Nissan 350Z's? you're at home here my friend. The first car sequence in this film is set within a multi-storey car park, a damn tight one!. The skills on show in this one sequence alone are breathtaking, the 350 drifts around the ultra tights bends inches from the walls, people and other parked cars. You gotta see it to believe it and its clearly real. The visuals in this film are a real treat, Japan is an extremely photogenic city and always looks good, especially at night. The sight of these glistening hyper cars purring along the highways and small streets of Tokyo, cruising part the neon lights, bustling crowds, old town areas and towering lit up skyscrapers is simply gorgeous. Most super cars/heavily modded cars look good anywhere, but set them in Japan and they just look even better, some lovely eastern car graphics and mod kits in this film too. Most of the car sequences in this film are stunning in all honesty, even the training sequences where our US lead learns to drift, its all filmed perfectly. The guys behind the camera knew how to get the best angles and shots for these sequences, the cars just look awesome. 350's, EVO's, a Mazda and a highly modded Silvia make up the roster this time but come the big finale race naturally the Yank tunes up his dads old Mustang to challenge the bad guy. Its kinda silly really because I really don't think there would be any way an old Mustang could beat a Nissan 350Z, especially at drifting, the Mustang couldn't handle it. But I can't deny the final race is pretty cool, its quite tense and does get your adrenaline going slightly...even though we know who's gonna win. The whole reason behind the race is daft anyway, why would a mafia kingpin allow a race to decide who leaves town. And why would the loser simply leave town? what is this a western!? doesn't the Yank and his friends owe money? wouldn't they cut his fingers off or something haha. Anyway this is hands down the best actual racing film in the franchise if you ask me, a very highly professional and realistic street racing flick which deserves respect. The location simply enhances the experience, the only thing I don't like about these films (including the first two) is watching these awesome Jap cars get bashed up, its painful to watch because they're amazing cars and damn expensive to run!. The very end is also fun with a cameo from 'Toretto' (Diesel) but again I gotta laugh, does this guy really think he can beat a Jap drift car in a tight multi-storey car park with a huge brick of a US car like the Plymouth Satellite!? damn thing is wider than a bus!.",phubbs,2013-09-15,2013
4.0,A lacklustre edition to the series,"Following on the (somewhat) decent success of the first two films, The Fast and the Furious franchise adds a third, and supposed last, film. Paul Walker appeared in the first two films but has left for this entrant in the trilogy, completely destroying the remaining links to the original. In fact, other than the title and the promise of done-up cars and many skimpy dressed women; this is a completely different film from its predecessors. One of the attractive features of the first two films was the speed of the racing. The high-risk speed has been dumped for another form of racing known as drifting. Racers in this format do not rely on their speed to win races but the precision of their turns. The gliding of the cars on the turns is drifting. However, drift racing is not as popular in America as it is in Japan. Thus, Tokyo is the location for the third film (another difference from the first two films). However, the main character is an American, so how does he get to Tokyo? Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) is an outsider at his high-school who loves illegal street races. After managing to ruin his car in a race against a fellow high-school student, Sean is sent to Tokyo to live with his father to avoid jail time. While in the Japanese school, he befriends Twinkie (Bow Wow) and gets introduced to the world of underground racing in Japan. It is through this that he talks to Neela (Australian-born Nathalie Kelley), where it is obvious that she is the romantic interest of Sean. Despite not being allowed to drive, he challenges D.K. ala ""Drift King"" (Brian Tee), a boy with connections to the Yakuza (as well as being Neela's boyfriend) with someone else's car. After destroying the lent car because of his lack of knowledge on the art of drifting, he is forced to repay his debt by entering the dangerous Tokyo underworld to repay his debt. It is incredible to see that casting has decided to give the role of the main character to someone with even less charisma than Paul Walker (yes, it is possible). Lucas Black is a horrendous actor, as is Bow Wow and Nathalie Kelley, who all do their jobs but they almost detract from the film because they are all so one-dimensional. Some of the blame must be shifted to the screenwriters, who have written an implausible story. The fact that the Yakuza becomes involved in this film just completely ruins the believability and the film becomes farcical once it is introduced. The lines that have been given to the actors are all horrible as well, most likely influencing some of the actors' performances. It seems as if they have all been written with a mechanical efficiency. Another downside to this film is the decision to go with drift racing. The races in Tokyo Drift are not as engaging as the races in the previous two films. The lack of speed makes the races seem like time-fillers rather than entertainment. This decision to change the racing style has stopped this film from being better. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a lacklustre addition to the franchise.",iicool11,2006-07-20,2006
10.0,The Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift is superb,"I'm a great fan of the original Fast and Furious and was extremely excited when 2 Fast 2 Furious was released only to be extremely disappointed. I wasn't to keen on seeing the Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift but i'm really glad i did. This film is superb, its actioned pack and has a genuine believable story line to it that gets you sitting on the edge of your seats. The huge plus to this film was Vin Dieseal even though it was only for a short amount of time. The new cast has brought a fresh and exciting presence to the film. Bring on the 4th Fast and Furious and hopefully we'll see Vin Dieseal in it, as well as all the new cast. That would really bring the story together!!!!!!!",clareski,2006-06-25,2006
5.0,SOLID BUT PREDICTABLE,"Solid third installment of F2F franchise. The characters were interesting. The production design and the setting really helped propel the film to new heights. It was exciting to watch, and every scene was packed with action-filled sequences. The only problem I had was the predictability and simplicity of the story: an American teenager takes risks in the streets of Tokyo with bad-ass gangsters against him but eventually he emerges at the top. The movie could use a little bit of plot twists. The stunts were crisp-perfect and the camera work was absolutely amazing. The director really excels in this film genre.",jeromesgabilo,2022-09-27,2022
2.0,"Please, make it stop...","I guess I asked for it, when I said I didn't want another hot and cold movie. Tokyo Drift certainly is a one way street. In fact, Tokyo Drift is quite possibly the worst racing movie ever committed to film.Everything starts out with a high school cat fight. Our ""hero"", Sean Boswell, sporting one of the worst southern accents ever, races the local jock for his girlfriend. Soon after, he gets arrested. Rather than send him off to prison, he is shipped off to Tokyo to live with his military father. Despite what he's been told (cause what cool Hollywood teen does what they're told?) he becomes re-involved in illegal street racing but in Tokyo. It's nearly impossible to summarize this plot, mainly because I'm laughing so hard. The story is so ridiculous and clichéd, that I feel sorry for anyone, like me, who was drug to this movie.Pick anything about this movie, and it's borderline suicide inducing. The music is awful. Really, if I want to listen to generic rap playing over car racing, I'll switch on MTV. If this is what cinema has become, then I might as well jump off a cliff.The acting is horrendous. I have never seen someone butcher the bad boy role like Lucas Black has. His portrayal of Sean is not only unrealistic, it's disturbingly puny. If that is his ""bad boy"" setting, he must be a puppy in real life. Everyone else here is simply terrible. At one point, I could have sworn I was watching The Young And The Restless and I liked it better than the normal gear of this movie.As with (most) racing movie fans, none of that matters to them. The question is, does Tokyo Drift deliver some adrenaline pumping races? Absolutely not. First off, the shaky cam is worse here, than it was in The Bourne Supremacy. I needed a barf bag during one. The inclusion of ""drifting"" is the biggest mistake. It chokes almost all the races and causes the excitement to be sucked out (not that I cared one way or the other). Finally, there are far too many slo-mo shots. This is not the Matrix, people; it's The Fast and The Furious. What is this doing in this movie? In closing, you would have to be drunk, high, or both to enjoy Tokyo Drift. It's a clichéd mess that not only delivers some fantastically bad acting, but doesn't even give us one decent race. If you are just dying for some racing action, I'd suggest drifting on over to Cars, because this film is just embarrassing.",KarisLOVER,2006-07-09,2006
8.0,Excellent driving and cinematography!,"Saw this movie last night and enjoyed most of it! There was a small bit of violence in the film which was disconcerting, but I guess you get that with the mafia scene in different countries. (and it was expected - as in the movie rating) The driving was fantastic - loved some of the camera work and stunts - very impressive.I'd recommend anyone interested in driving, and also Japanese culture check it out - it's a nice change from your typical American driving films!! Also, Australian actor Nathalie Kelley was awesome! Another nice twist featuring this new young actor - it's great to hear an Aussie accent throughout! Well played part.I think the movie ended well too :-) Enjoy!",au_bb,2006-06-15,2006
4.0,"Fast & Furious 3 ""Now With Turning!""","It took me a while to get around to this one given that it's the other Fast & Furious movie--the one without any of the main cast in it (save for a couple of cameos). It wasn't really worth the wait.Justin Lin brings some energy to the proceedings but the movie can't escape the lack of star power, unconvincing characters, lackluster romance, and formulaic script. Also, Sonny Chiba doesn't beat the crap out of anyone, which made me sad.The cars looked nice, but I'm not a car guy so the particulars were probably lost on me. I didn't quite understand the point of the drift racing. If I spent many months of income on pimping out my Mazda I don't think I'd want to slam it through a parking garage at top speed. I guess Tokyo doesn't have much of a nightlife and people have to make their own fun.Super-fans of the franchise will probably want to take a look. Every one else can probably skip it.",My_Pet_Mongoose,2013-06-18,2013
8.0,Fast and Delivered,"It's been a long time since Hollywood delivered a damn good action film... this movie is DA BOMMMMM! The race scenes (the only scenes that matter) were unbelievable. Friggin' Frankenheimer-worthy. I have never seen ‘drifting’ before, but I have a feeling it's going to get pretty popular. People were so excited, they were drifting in the parking lot afterwards (they probably needed more lessons, though). I don't know if people should really see this film as a sequel to the other two. The most interesting thing about the movie is the ‘drifting’ which is equal to skateboarding with race cars. I liked the first one okay. Didn't care for the second. Paul Walker can't carry a movie. But, Lucas Black (the kid from ‘Sling Blade’) sure can. The guy can communicate his thoughts by doing nothing like a character from ‘The Good, The Bad and the Ugly’, unlike Walker who can't even communicate his thoughts by telling you what he's thinking. Black is a big reason why this is a cool movie. I just hope people don't stay away from this movie because of it's inferior predecessors. This flick doesn't need to be a sequel. It kicks butt on its own. Hollywood probably felt safer calling it a sequel. Anyone who stays away from this baby is going to miss out big time. Because Tokyo Drift runs circles around the Fast and the Furious 1 and 2. TD is the best of the Furious. Forget Mr. Cruise and the sinking cruise ship movie. This thing is like riding shotgun in a movie theater. Plus, there's a really cool surprise ending that I probably shouldn't give away, although someone else might unfortunately. The audience friggin' erupted when it happened. It was way, way cool.",cheriozone,2006-06-15,2006
4.0,"Not Much Of A Movie, Although Lucas Black Is Good.","Let me be honest and say I saw this film solely because Lucas Black was in it. I like his tough look and sweet Alabama drawl, but despite his presence and a couple of good driving stunts, this is a nothing movie. It's reminiscent of the ‘Stock Car Race’ movies from film companies like American International Pictures that were commonplace when I was a kid. While I am usually willing to do it, too much suspension of disbelief was expected of me for my own enjoyment. Lucas Black is about 24; he cannot play a seventeen year old. The story of the film would still have worked if Sean, (Black's character) was his real chronological age. They could even have used the same plot device of him wrecking a housing development in an illegal race and that is why he's sent to stay with his dad in Japan instead of going to jail. But to pretend that Sean is 17 is just dumb. Nobody would give that much credence to a 17 year old no matter how tough. The ‘Tokyo Drift’ part is also kind of dumb. It seems to be a driving stunt wherein you propel the car forward in a sideways position. This is used to a fun effect with the drivers getting to the top of a parking garage and all, but this ‘drifting’ as it's called I have seen before in stock car races. I've seen it in James Bond movies and in last years The Dukes Of Hazard movie. In fact, ‘drifting’ is the whole major plot point in the Pixar film Cars and in Owen Wilson's inability to do it well. In fact, watching the drifting in The Dukes Of Hazard was better because it was filmed with longer shots. Director Justin Lin does too much MTV style quick cutting and it gets annoying. That kind of rapid cutting really only works in limited doses, it is tiring over the length of a feature film. Besides, in The Dukes Of Hazard, I had the feeling that the stunt people were actually driving the cars, in this its one cut after another and you don't get any sense of the cars being driven. The scene where about ten cars come ‘drifting’ down a mountain road is cool, but the story is still dumb. Too bad, I really want to see Lucas Black in something better. There is something very attractive and real about him that has yet to be tapped. He has a no nonsense demeanor that could work very well on screen, like a cross between Charles Bronson and Jimmy Stewart. I know that sounds like an odd mix, but I think it can work. I think he can be a star, even though that might not be what he wants.",Michael-70,2006-06-19,2006
5.0,The Flat and the Furious.,"My journey through the Fast and the Furious series has brought me to the third film, Tokyo Drift, which - alongside Fast Five - was one of the only movies in this series I'd seen some years ago. I remembered basically nothing about the film, and rewatching it, I can see why. It's a bit of a snooze, even though there are moments that are kind of fun here and there. I think it has a good final act... actually, that's where most of the fun stuff is. It opens with a stupid, over-the-top race, and then meanders for about an hour or so, all before finally delivering some decent action in the last half-hour.I'd say it's better than the first movie, and I genuinely wonder whether I'll get to the end of the series now liking all the sequels more than that one. I think it disappoints a little after the second movie, though, which I was pleasantly surprised by.Tokyo Drift did the impossible by making me wish Vin Diesel would return to the series. The protagonist of Tokyo Drift is very bland, and when Diesel shows up in his cameo near the end, he's so much more charismatic. Guess that sometimes, you don't know what you've got until it's gone. But Paul Walker still trumps Diesel at this stage, and I wonder if Tokyo Drift would've been a little better if they got his character wrapped up in all the stuff the actual main character does.Here's hoping the fourth movie and those after are better. I like these movies when they get silly and over-the-top (and when they're less about racing too, to be honest), and I wish Tokyo Drift had been more consistently goofy. I only really had fun in the final act, and most of the film before then made me feel tired.",Jeremy_Urquhart,2024-06-19,2024
10.0,this movie was off the hook it was better then the first 2,"The Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift not only contained evos, skylines and the vielside Mazda rx7 it contained a lot of hot girls and for u guys that like classic cars it contained that. The 67 mustang they supped up wit a skyline engine was crazy and i know everyone will fall in love with it. Also a great ending it just never stopped wit the action the whole audience was going crazy at the end wit Vin diesal return but its only for like 2 mins, but this movie u will be on the edge of ur seats. This one was much better then the 2nd movie and just a little bit better then the first but the lead actor black is the next Paul walker this movie rocked.",ballermm,2006-06-17,2006
3.0,More focus on cars and action than the characters,"At this point, the cars are the true stars of this franchise. They are exciting, fast and ultimately have more personality plus screen presence than most of the actors.",naty-77974,2022-05-02,2022
10.0,' loved it its was extremely beautiful',"i have loved everyone of the fast and furious films as i love cars and have always wanted to become a female racer. the film was very predictable but all films are. I'm very emotional so me and me female friends cried in the middle though none of the boys did. i loved the romance and the cars and the glamour and gracefulness of drifting. I think all the actors were great even my friends that didn't like cars enjoyed the film. loved it all!!! i feel that i got my moneys worth and that i would recommend this film to anyone, most of all under 30's and not just boys. Its a film i could watch again as it contains my passion for hot cars and partying.",shuger1,2006-06-25,2006
5.0,The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift - Jamison Slabaugh,The film is a fun thrilling ride like the first two Fast and Furious films. The street racing cinematography in this film is done much better in my opinion. The pacing and score aren't the best but they don't stand out as issues either. This film is very disconnected from the first two as the film picks up with a new character called Sean. He runs away from all of his problems. Every time he might go to jail he moves away. When he gets to Tokyo and doesn't know how to drift he gets humbled real fast. The love interest in this film is weak in my opinion due to the fact that she has no motives or real character behind the face. The antagonist is just fine. He works for the film but he's nothing special due to the fact that again he doesn't really have any motives other than the fact that Sean embarrassed him and he values pride. Now the relationship between Sean and his father works very well in the film. His father understands and relates to Sean making the decision to not run away from his problems this time. He also just wants what's best for him. Overall not a bad film. 6/10 STARS.,jamisonslabaugh,2024-07-06,2024
2.0,Famous Toyo Drift?,"There was nothing I liked about this movie (except maybe the Hulk car), so I can't even give it 3 stars. I wish I could, but my heart will not allow it.I was bored the entire time. The ENTIRE time. The highlights of this movie were still boring to me, and it didn't matter what the stakes are and how many visual effects or mind blowing drifts were there on the screen. I simply didn't care.I had no reason to, really. Why would I? We got completely new, random character and were told basically nothing about the guy, but the fact that he was a bad boy who liked to smash some cars and get as many girl as possible. After finishing the movie I still feel like I don't know him.The reason is - I didn't pay attention. I know I didn't and I could probably blame myself for that but then again why would I? The movie wasn't interesting. It didn't show me why I should forget characters from previous Fast & Furious and instead focus on the new Mr Bad Boy. I didn't WANT to pay attention. I just wanted to get over with it and skip to the next part.Maybe the reason why so many people liked it is because they remember it from when it came out. Maybe back then it was a real banger, maybe it was new and refreshing. But we're not in those time anymore, and as much as I love the first F&F, this one definitely didn't age well. Unless you're just a big boy who likes to watch cars. There's nothing wrong with that, we all like something that objectively, let's be honest, isn't really that good. This time it's just not the case for me.",polajakimowicz,2024-02-26,2024

5.0,"An average addition to the ""Fast and the furious"" franchise.","Not being a particularly ardent car-lover or fan of street racing at all, I didn't go into this movie with high hopes. Nevertheless, even for non-revheads like me there are enough enjoyable elements in this film to keep you from walking out. Some exhilarating car races, notable moments of humour and of course a veritable parade of attractive and underdressed women kept me entertained. The illogical storyline and numerous plot holes began to get annoying by the end; if the movie wasn't so long then this wouldn't have been as noticeable. Also, the Vin Diesel cameo was rather poorly played. Besides these admittedly minor gripes, there is a lot of fun to be had here - flashy cars, hot girls and a surprisingly competent Lil' Bow Wow in an amusing side-role.",reti_incarnate,2006-06-22,2006
8.0,WHY o why did they have to use... HIM????,"Anyone who has seen the first two movies would agree that part of the movies' appeal (at least to the girls) was Paul Walker's sex appeal. Anyone who was anticipating a similar character in the third installment would have been as greatly disappointed as I was. The main character of Sean seemed to be trying to portray similar characteristics to Brian O'Conner but dismally failed! Lucas Black almost ruined the movie for me. not just because he is pretty much BUTT ugly, but his acting skills bordered on ridiculous. Besides this MAJOR flaw in this movie, I found it to be quite enjoyable. As a fan of the first two films, I was not disappointed with the cars or racing action. In fact, I enjoyed the high danger drifting more than the regular racing! The culture of the Tokyo nightlife was enthralling, and I was attracted by all the colors and costumes featured. It seems that if this movie had not contained the appalling acting of Lucas Black, this movie would have been even more of a box office hit than it was. 8/10 for storyline and racing, but 2/10 for acting",stacka_girl,2006-09-29,2006
3.0,Bad,"In this week (Sunday 20th - Sunday 27th) I will watch all Fast and Furious movies. One per day. The first one was pretty good. The second was disappointing. The third was more disappointing… ‘Fast and furious: Tokyo Drift’ is just a bad excuse to watch racing games. The first Fast and furious had a good story. It was better in many different ways. It was packed with lot of action and well played characters. If you want to watch a good and exciting movie, then don't watch this. The story is bad, the acting in the movie was bad. To put it mildly: Do not watch this movie! PS. Sorry for my English! :)",tullemis,2016-03-24,2016
5.0,"""Life's Simple, You Make Choices And You Don't Look Back."" --- Han (Sung Kang)","‘The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift’ (2006) Directed By: Justin Lin Starring: Lucas Black, Nathalie Kelley, Bow Wow, Brian Tee, Sung Kang, & Brian Goodman MPAA Rating: ‘PG-13’ (for reckless and illegal behavior involving teens, violence, language and sexual content) ‘The Fast and the Furious’ and its sequel were not groundbreaking works in cinema by any means. They were shallow and predictable but they were something that this third installment is not. They were fun. It is not uncommon for a franchise that makes it this far to fall flat with the third filmand, unfortunately, this is no different. ‘The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift’ almost had me fooled into thinking it was going to be unique. After all, it has an all-new cast, a new setting, new cars, and a new racing style. The problem is that the plot that ties all of these aspects together is just as dull and clichéd as I originally suspected. I recently viewed a little horror film called ‘The Woods’ and my major criticism with it was that nothing seemed to happen for the first hour and then the climax was all squeezed into a brief period. ‘Tokyo Drift’ suffers from the same problem. For the first half of the movie, I was practically falling asleep. Then, the ending kicked in and that was when I got the high-octane fun showcased in the first two movies. But, by the time this fun burst onto the screen, I was a little too far gone to care. In order to escape an extended stay in a juvenile detention center for a little racing accident, Sean Boswell (Black) agrees to go stay with his military father (Goodman) in Tokyo, Japan. While at school, Sean meets Twinkie (Bow Wow) who introduces him to the underworld of drift racing. Sean agrees to race the ‘Drift King’ (Tee), a.k.a D.K, but, when he loses and destroys someone else's racing car in the process, Sean finds himself thrown into the center of a world that is far more dangerous than he could ever imagine. To pay back his debt, Sean begins to practice the art of drifting and he will, ultimately, have to face D.K yet again in order to prove himself and to escape this underworld alive. The performances in ‘The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift’ leave just a little too much to be desired. Lucas Black is convincing enough but the southern accent came off as comical and distracting. I understand that he is from Alabama so the accent is probably all-natural, but it just takes away from any emotional impact some of the scenes may have had. Nathalie Kelley does a fine job, considering that this is her first role. Am I really supposed to take an actor who calls himself ‘Bow Wow’ seriously? Oh wait; he's a rapper who wants to be an actor so I guess that justifies the silly name. Anyway, name aside, he just didn't sell me. I cannot take this guy seriously and can you really blame me? He did star in ‘Like Mike’, after all. Brian Tee was, surprisingly, flat, especially considering that he is the main villain. I felt as though I was watching a piece of wood act evil, rather than a paid actor. Where was the emotion? Where was any sign of life? The word ‘boring’ comes to mind. I knew this movie was in trouble when I saw Zachary Ty Brian portraying a high school student yes, I said a high school student. If you will remember, Brian played a high school student in ‘The Rage: Carrie 2’ and in the television series, ‘Home Improvement’, in 1999 (more than seven years ago). And he does not even look like a high school student now, but, thinking back, neither does Lucas Black or anyone else for that matter. In fact, this entire movie does not seem to be set in Tokyo or even in Japan. Most of the characters, despite living in Tokyo and being Japanese, speak English fluently. It seems as though Hollywood still believes that any country in the world is part of America, as long as it is beneficial to their latest money-maker. In fact, it seems as though a southern boy can fit in very well in Japan without any knowledge of the culture or language and can make many, many friends. I didn't buy it. Overall, ‘The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift’ is a movie that takes itself far too seriously and doesn't even begin to entertain until the final half. But, when it does actually become exciting, it is just about as effective and fun as these types of movies can get. Final Thought: If only the first half had been entertaining as the last. Overall Rating: 5/10 (B-)",Robert_Hearth,2006-12-03,2006
9.0,My Favorite of the series,"I've watched all the series (except for the Hobbs spin off) and Tokyo drift is my favorite. Its like OHMSS of the Bond series, in that it fits in evolutionary point of the series where they get things just right, and there is a great balance.Lets face it, this is a divisive FandF movie. A lot of people hate it, and to many its one of the best, if not the best of the series.Tokyo drift doesn't have some of the ridiculous over the top unrealistics scenes, like cars shooting at planes, and fighting tanks or racing submarines. Some of those action sequences in the later movies are fun, but unbelievable and really take away from the tone of what is really a straight car action movie.Tokyo drift doesn;t ahve the other the top military aspects. Sure there is a Yakuza element, but ultimately, these are just people racing cars. There's no machine guns involved, no martial arts fights... its about car culture, and how that fits with people.The movie gets it just right. Justin Lin has come in and made it slicker than the first two movies, however it still relatively realistic unlike the later ones.On top of that, its set in an interesting exotic locale, and Lucas Black's character as a fish out of water character is interesting enough, as are some of the supporting characters, including Sung Kang. That said, bits of it are not authentic, and while Sonny Chiba is an icon in Japan, his English dialogue is stilted here.Overall, its the only one of hte series I watch regularly. The series could really benefit from having Lucas Black's character back involved!",info-5918,2019-12-19,2019
4.0,"A movie? No. A car exposition, sure.","It gets a four because it's stylish. I watched this movie and I can't remember any of the characters' names. Do they have any? Is it important? They're just teenage cannon-fodder for lame plot devices. Young American reject wants to be successful with the ladies, so he steals Dad's car to race the local Jock, who is very successful with the ladies, mostly because he's a jerk. Ladies love the bad boys. Don't you, girls? Anyways, you already know that if it has Fast and Furious in the title, it's gonna be unflattering to the female gender. So yes, girls walk around dressed sexily, men drool and leash them, great S&M fun. American reject runs his car into some trouble during the race against the typical joke- I mean jock character and is kicked out of home (or something to that effect) by Dad. He ends up in Japan and decides he has to... Y'know, race. To uh... get money. Yeah. I'm not sure, he just is placed in a Japanese college where an afro-American manages to speak Japanese without everyone around him glaring at him mercilessly. If you must know, the Japanese aren't very warm-hearted about occidentals speaking their language. The afro-American becomes his buddy, obviously. IT JUST SO HAPPENS that this same man owns a garage and will lend the kid a car so he can do races. Not traditional races of course! Drift races! So obviously, the American reject kid sucks, he breaks a car and owes one to the afro, who acts somewhat cool about it. Meanwhile, Dad does some groaning of his own. The rest of the story revolves around getting a new car to race the big king of the Tokyo drift. If people have watched the first F & F movie, you'll recognize the dude who's at the head of it all. I don't remember his name but I went ‘Hey, it's him.’ with the least enthusiasm as possible. Vin Diesel makes an appearance at the end as the new challenger. DRIFTING WITH A DUST CHARGER.

5.0,Worst of the three.,"This movie was an average movie. I mean, I love the Fast and the Furious movies, but it's gotten much less into plot and development, and more into good looking cars and cool stunts. The movie starts off alright but each turn it gets worse and worse. The acting isn't horrible, but it isn't that great. The entire movie leads up to American muscle (an old Mustang model) which has been completely modified with import parts, and a Japanese import drift racing down a mountain. The whole race though could've completely been avoided, ended up being a stupid choice, and should've killed both the racers, though both make out alive, even though one clearly should've died. It was a decent movie in the end because the stunts were really cool, so I give it 5 stars, but I wouldn't see it in theaters again. I'd maybe put it in my queue on Netflix if I was bored and wanted to see some cool stunts, but if I wanted a good racing movie, I'd get the original Fast and the Furious.",deadlypker,2007-01-01,2007
5.0,decent,possible spoilers The whole movie was great until about the end. There was a good plot line and everything. then they take an American classic a early to late 70's ford mustang gt and put a Nissan engine in it. i realize some of you may not get this but i am the biggest fan of muscle cars. this pisses me off so much. i do not know what the hell they were thinking The main point of the movie though was good and the plot lines were done well. i do believe that they will do another movie to wrap up the series including Vin diesel and Dom torentto. i think that there idea of releasing a commerical ruined the surprise but there was a big competition between that and nacho libre.,Pschmeiser,2006-06-17,2006
9.0,From someone who has reviewed more than ONE movie ever,"I'm not sure why this movie didn't spark the interest that the other FATF movies did but I think this is the best one of the three. The cinematography was awesome, the women are gorgeous. The villain was believable, it has almost non-stop action, and some genuinely funny lines. I never believe any reviews from anyone that has only reviewed one movie because they obviously have an agenda in either over hyping or needlessly trashing a movie. What I don't understand is why isn't anyone putting legitimate critiques up of this movie. The weakest point in this movie is trying to swallow that a guy w/ a southern accent could so instantly be accepted and trusted in a prominent drift club in Tokyo. OK suspend that disbelief and this move MOVES! I never once felt bored or lost or clicked my tongue and rolled my eyes like I did in the last FATF movie. Maybe people were hoping for more of the same trash, I'm not sure but this is an above average, I'd even say exciting, summer race film not like many others. I hope this sparks some other real reviews.",yoncenator,2006-06-19,2006
4.0,this becoming worse,Fast and the Furious started with high boost in its kind but it becoming worse by acting and quality. 2. film also good with visual effects but this one is worst nightmare. As some of you know this series going parallel with nfs series and share the incoming $ . But producers must have better screenplay and actors or actresses. When we come to Lucas Blake ( Sean Boswell ) he act like he wanna make this movie worst in the history at least Brian King ( DK ) rocks in this film like he never did before.After all i can say don't watch this film if u don't want to hate from hot wheels. I hope that next films won't interest with drift or drag races and excite us with their story and cars and interesting races.,lucky_is_me,2006-12-20,2006
10.0,Good Movie,"I think this movie is far more superior than the first two. The cars are excellent and the special effects raise up your heart beats at times. The setting Tokyo is very interesting, it's quite different from the first two. At first I thought this was going to be a lame movie but it really surprised me, it was more than what I expected. The actors are great, you will never get bored. The plot is intense, there are sad and good moments. I love the movie soundtrack and I love the ending. The ending was the best part. I think this is a must see movie, trust me it wont hurt seeing it. I can't wait to see part 4, I hope it takes place in Tokyo as well.",blue_skyrose,2006-06-24,2006
4.0,tedious and dull...not a movie I'd plan on seeing again,"Here comes yet another race car movie with fairly good acting, mediocre directing, a poorly-written script, and badly executed shots with nothing to show but a few scenes worth mentioning about, but soon to be forgotten. As will Tokyo Drift be in a few years. It's just not the kind of movie to spark interest in the majority of audiences.So maybe there were a few memorable parts done by the characters, such as when our lead guy gets involved in an accident at the beginning and smiles at the other two victims with blood-encased teeth. But pretty much, the rest of his part is just your average want-to-be tough guy who will lose the first time and come around the second time. His friends include some guy who never seems to run out of cars (gee, how unexpected), a guy who sells broken junk, and others. Lots of dull and uninteresting characters. And we get some highway chase scenes that are hardly any more exciting than the rest of the movie.Overall, The Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift cannot be described as a disappointment, mainly because, not much could ever be expected from a movie such as this. And it is not one I'd plan on seeing again.",TheUnknown837-1,2006-12-09,2006
5.0,No more,"The film tries to go back and catch the essence of the first movie. It might not (really) have any actors from the previous installments, but the ‘Fast & Furious’ feeling is there ... and wait til the end for a little surprise (unless someone told you or you read it, you won't really expect it). The thing is, the stunts are top notch, really good. But the story doesn't carry through Lucas Black seems to loathe every minute he is on screen, while cursing his agent, who got him the role(?). Even Paul Walker felt more ‘right’ in the franchise. If you wanna fast forward and watch the stunts, you might add a point or two to my vote.",lubrikatya,2022-01-19,2022
10.0,Kept me interested,"I'll vote 10 simply because people hate on this movie. Honestly this is much better than a 3.5 - just look at Ong-Bak. It didn't have much of a plot but people gave it decent ratings because of the amazing action right? Same deal here.We don't see movies like this for plot, nor do we expect actors that will make us cry. I saw this movie for its cars, action, and women. And I have to say all three were very nice.When you watch this movie you'll be pretty impressed that all the drifting is done by real people. If it was CG then I wouldn't think that much of this movie, but it impressed me.",stanbeaver,2006-06-16,2006
2.0,Total trash,"This movie is crap. There's no nicer way to put it. The main character is a totally dis-likable character. He's supposedly just turned 18...though by his 5-o'clock shadow, he clearly is not. Not to mention he's a chicken that repeatedly fails to live up to his friends, his family...and everyone else. The movie starts with the revelation that he's already destroyed his mother's life. Then he goes to work on his father's. The whole point of this movie is apparently about racing...regardless of your friends, the property damage, or....anything else. Lets not forget the race at the end, where the movie producers decided that 'American muscle' would beat out Japanese supercars. Not only is it nauseating pampering to US viewers, its totally untrue...except in a movie. Japanese cars corner like these corner like they are on rails. Its all they were built for. On the other hand, American cars like the old Mustang shown corner like...tanks. Don't get me wrong, on a flat stretch they are hard to beat. But in a drifting battle...? I love the old Mustangs...but a corner machine, it isn't. All I can say is...if this were my child, I'd ship him back home. Maybe some time in jeuvie is a good cure for stupidity.",harbeau,2006-09-29,2006
10.0,The movie was great!!,"I just saw the movie tonight and thought it was great!! The actors were good, I especially liked Shawn, he seemed laid back but still had the energy needed to get the job done. Bow-wow did a good job, too. Liked the scenery of Tokyo, thought they picked the perfect place to film this movie. The cars were awesome!! The drifting was cool - never saw that before. Liked it better than the first 2. Justin Lin did a great job - there were some good closeup shots of Neela and Shawn that were really good. It kept me on the edge of my seat - as well as everyone else in the theater. It was good to see Vin Diesel - he's a character. Would definitely recommend it.",workingirl,2006-06-16,2006
5.0,Tokyo Drift,"I like Lucas Black. He's the kind of actor that isn't limited by his southern accent and has the ability to always play believable characters even if they are stuck in genre films like this second sequel to the ‘race-car’ franchise which has a lot of cars speeding and crashing with some plot thrown in to distract some. In this film Black is saddled with limited story to somehow overcome what is essentially a cliché part and create something out of it. For the most part, he succeeds. He plays this unfortunate teenager stuck in the role of ‘magnet’..he always seems to link himself to trouble. With no other alternative but jail, Lucas' Sean Boswell is sent to Tokyo where his military dad resides to somehow stay away from hot-rodding. It doesn't matter where Sean goes, he is destined to be placed a position to race for something, whether it's for high-stakes or good ole' fashioned pride. He rubs a yakuza boss' nephew the wrong way almost instantly, but finds an ally in Han(Sung Kang, who is really the best thing about the film next to Black)..someone who seems connected to DK(the yakuza boss' nephew, played with a twisted look of menace by Brian Tee), but only by business standards. DK(Drift King)is known as the best racer and one who is indeed feared. He takes his role as yakuza nephew very seriously. Heck, even DK's smile is a snarl. He has a girl by his side named Neela(Nathalie Kelley)who has a thing for Sean..she is pretty much his trophy to show off(Neela was taken in by DK's grandmother we learn so that seems to mean she's his girl by default). Bow Wow adds flava and soul as Twinkie, an army brat like Sean who fulfills his goal as token black kid by selling goods for profit. He also does what he can with a cliché role. The film pretty much uses story as padding for all the dangerous races. Within the sub-plot we learn that Han has been stealing from DK, so this sets in motion a death and climactic race to end all races between Sean and DK..loser must leave Tokyo for good. The place the big happens is up a curvy mountain known to only be driven by one man..DK. I feel bad for Lin who must sacrifice story for stylish chases. His ‘Better Luck Tomorrow’ was right the opposite. The characters in that film were able to grow in a very fascinating story. It's not the case here. People come to a film like this for the cars that rev up and the speedy, lightning-quick turns down highways in traffic(one scene show Sean almost drive into a crowd of people). The film shows how ‘drifting’ is the way to race in Tokyo. Drifting is a high-profile way of turning curves with delicate precision without hitting anything. To be honest, the whole film is ridiculous and it's hard to believe one ounce squeezed from this formula racer. Black tries to embody his young man with truth because he has nowhere else to go..he's at the end of his rope and this climactic race may be his last chance to really put an end to the dangerous lifestyle that always followed right at his feet.",Scarecrow-88,2006-09-28,2006
4.0,The fast and the furious: Tokyo drift: disappointing sequel to a strong first two,"Tokyo drift is not only a bad sequel, it's also the movie that ruined mustangs for me and this is how, in the climax, they put a Nissan engine IN A SHELBY, I get that it's Japan, but it would have been faster without that piece of crap engine, but at least the starting of this movie was pretty good, so it's not awful, it's mediocre.",thesterlingweaver,2021-11-28,2021
10.0,Definitely much better than Roper and Leno painted it!,"For one thing, the caption that identifies the jetliner as landing at Tokyo International Airport was very useful. Because, otherwise, ALL THAT SCENE SHOWED WAS A JETLINER LANDING! Something that could have been stock footage shot at some other airport, for some other movie, over the last twenty years. Secondly; the writers of this movie tell a completely new story (for the most part). No overseas assignment for FBI Agent Conner, the lead-footed undercover guy from the first two flicks. Nope! We get a whole new lead-foot, named Sean Boswell. A navy brat whose parents are divorced: the mom living in Texas. And, the dad living in Tokyo. The street-racing segment that gets Sean exiled to Japan is refreshingly realistic, with regard to the consequences (both medical and legal). So, too, is Sean's ‘fish-out-water’ feeling, during his first day in a school where English is REALLY a second language! That's where he meets Twinkie (an African-American army brat and Donald Trump wanna-be) And, through him, Han: a Chinese-American expatriate who is both rival and business partner of ‘DK’ Takashi (nephew of a local yakuza bigwig). The ‘Romeo and Juliet’ thing that develops between Sean and Neela (Takashi's half-gaijin girlfriend) is admittedly a little predictable. But, the way they start to get to know each other isn't any more far-fetched than, say, Ren McCormick and Ariel Shaw, in the deservedly classic ‘Footloose.’ Two strangers in a strange land, getting to know each other, and building up gradually, from there. But, the street-racing sequences are, of course, the main attraction. I admire the stunt doubles who REALLY handled the driving in those scenes! I certainly don't envy them, however. Especially, the climactic race down that Japanese mountain road. Hoo-boy! I swear: I got vertigo just WATCHING those shots of what waited just beyond each cliffside curve. I guess the only other thing I can say, in favor of this movie, is the uncredited cameo towards the end. You continuity addicts will love it. *Insert mischievous snickering here.*",Carycomic,2006-06-17,2006
5.0,forgettable,"I didnt care about this movie at all, it was a completely different story and felt more like a spinoff then having anything to do with the actual story, im not gunna remember this because its just out of place and meh.",jeremyrhess,2021-08-01,2021
10.0,As the Summer movies go!!!,I have been to the midnight openers of all the summer Blockbusters. After each of theses movie so far (not including Pirates thats next week) my friends and myself walk out of the theater poking holes in each of the movies.X-men - one battle. Cruse impossible - same old thing... whats newSuperman - only showed up 3 or 4 time in the movie F&F - From beginning to end. So far the best of the summer. It is not Hollywood like the first or Miami Vice Like the second one. It is the first time that Hollywood has made a action movie right for the MTV gen.SEE THE MOVIE - and tell me where I am wrong!,alecia-steiner,2006-06-29,2006
5.0,"Fast cars, dangerous driving, wrapped around a sliver of plot","(48%) A movie that screams ""yoof culture"" from the very first frame, and because the hip-hop and J-pop littered soundtrack both lack any sort of deep meaning resulting in the soundtrack occasionally needing to dip into a typical Hollywood movie score to build any sort of feel or mood. But to be honest adding any sort of soul to this is like adding Furtmun and Mason organic chutney to a big mac, as this is as deep as a puddle left behind by a 4 week old puppy. With that said though this is an enjoyable, massively simplistic watch with lots of entertaining reckless driving, stunts, and slick direction. And if that's all you want, then that's all you'll get.",adamscastlevania2,2015-02-22,2015
5.0,more of the same,"Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift is another in the continuing saga of kids driving cars fast and furious. A delinquent gets in trouble and is sent by his divorced mother to Tokyo and his Navy father. He has some trouble adjusting, gets in with the bad crowd right away, and spends the rest of the film trying to redeem himself to his friends and save himself from the gangsters he's become involved with. Lots of fancy rice burners and a few real American cars litter the screen. Some good race sequences and action, but not much acting. A Surprise at the end, well, maybe not so much of a surprise. If you like crashing cars and kids acting tough, then you'll like this.",wrlang,2006-10-10,2006
9.0,Watch this movie!,"There's only one part of this movie I disagree with, but I don't want to spoil it at all, so you'll have to email me or something if you really want to know about that (phoenix_darkhawk@yahoo.com). Tight rides and tighter tracks, Very few sequels stand up to the original, but this one was probably the best of the trilogy. There was less focus on the appearance of the vehicles than the first two, more on the story, and better racing. The guest star at the very end is a nice touch too, for those who have liked the whole series. The acting is overall good, even though I rather disliked the heavy southern accent of the main character, he just sounded too much like a hick (and I'm from Oklahoma!). Seriously though, if you like good races, fast cars, and a good story, this is a must see movie.",phoenix_darkhawk,2006-06-24,2006
4.0,A Bad Vacation,"This review is going to be a little rougher than the last two as there are a couple things I want to point out. I'm a gaijin named Sean. I love Tokyo. I love Yakuza related films. So this film obviously was built for me and my ilk. While the other two were appealing to the fourteen year old American crowd, this one is more accessible to a different crowd while still maintaining the integrity of what makes a Fast and Furious film what it is.Sean is Forest Gump's son, complete with terrible Southern accent. He's also ten years too old to be in high school but we'll let that one slide too. After getting into a race (over a girl) that involved a lot of property destruction and reckless endangerment, the police let him get away with it because his mom is sending him to Tokyo to live with his father, who serves in the Navy. Makes no sense because the American Navy is stationed further south and has nothing to do with Tokyo, but we'll let everything slide because pretty much the entirety of the opening exposition is nonsensical and stupid.One big example is how Sean is enrolled at a Japanese high school. Okay, that's fine, and the fact there are other Americans there shows it may be a sort of transfer high school. The problem is the fact the teachers don't speak English, thus making a guy who can't speak Japanese completely useless to the institution. Why not enroll him in a school where the teachers speak English (of which there are a few in Tokyo)? Since Sean was sent to Tokyo to get away from racing (which makes sense since the vast majority of people in Tokyo don't have cars to commute) he, of course, winds up getting into racing anyway. Drifting to be precise. He pisses off the nephew of a Yakuza, gets with the guy's girl (thus proving that this series has no plot aside from dumb guy trying to get with bad guys girl).The racing in this movie is actual racing, neither the garbage of the first film nor the more action-centric driving of the second. Tokyo Drift has some really good races, the best in the series so far, and thankfully these races aren't marred by the nitrous button (though it is used once).Sean, the character, is even more boring than O'Conner (somehow), the female fling is forgettable and useless, the bad guy is lame, and the obligatory black side kick is Bow Wow, instantly knocking multiple points off.The ending is what ties this film in with the others, though it doesn't feel at all natural and seems to just be fan service. (EDIT: This film does actually have a lot to do with the series as you get further in).Tokyo Drift is a decent addition to the franchise, one that does a lot better job with the racing than previous iterations. But aside from that it doesn't have any reason to keep you coming back for a second watch and, as such, it falls flat.",sn319,2014-12-06,2014
10.0,Best Fast n Furious movie,Best Fast n Furious movie. This movie is seriously underrated.,jayk_,2019-12-14,2019
5.0,Eye Candy just like the other 2,"Fun, Fast and Flashy. Like the other 2 it mostly ignores physics and completely ignores common sense. The drifting is cool but better in person with real professionals. I think a good half of the drifting in this was CG. Hell there was more ""real"" drifting in the Dukes of Hazard remake.Finally I think the most annoying part was during the major chase through Tokyo none of these drivers ""drove"" to get away. Drifting is NOT the fastest way through a corner, so if your running from someone why would you drift.Any way, I enjoyed it but if you like cars or racing, and have a average understanding of both, your gonna be shaking your head a lot.",Physicker,2006-06-17,2006
4.0,movie in two words- Tokyo and drift,"This movie was brutally average, and it seemed that the film makers wanted to accomplish two things. First was to make a movie in Japan. The other was to make a movie with expensive cars doing maneuvers not filmed before. The result of which was a movie mad with excellent visuals and fast paced action and the story was badly hurt by it. So much emphasis on making a cool looking movie that every one seemed to forget about the story. And there was good potential for a phenomenal story but any where they could have made the story shine they failed. Characters that were important to the main character were left under developed. You cant blame the screenwriter, but I haven't seen the script so maybe you can. And important plot points were nulled over and passed off just to get to the racing. But all in all the movie wasn't terrible or a complete loss, everything that made the movie bad can easily be corrected with another sequel. Which I am sure that Hollywood wouldn't have a problem with, it means more money for them.",garysbass,2006-06-23,2006
10.0,Best Fast and Furious movie,This movie trumps over the other 2 no problem. There is more excitement and more racing. More action packed and none of the sexuality or strong language content which is really great if you have a young one watching it with you. The cars are great I'm not really into cars but this movie I think changed that. I went and seen it last weekend at the Drive In and I am going to go see it again this weekend. That is how great it is. Lucas Black is awesome in it. He really has grown up since The War and Sling Blade. HHHHHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!! I give it 20 thumbs up. I promise you will not be disappointed. Well I guess that is all I can really say about you will just have to go watch it for yourself and decide what you think about it.,dachshundsr1,2006-06-21,2006
5.0,Fast & Furious 3 : Tokyo Drift,"Great movie, great cars but very poor acting performance. Me together with a lot of friends are looking forward to the next : FAST AND THE FURIOUS 4 - THE ULTIMATE CHALLENGE. If they haven't started it yet a good scenario would be that each country : USA, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, UK are sending their best drivers and cars to a secret place for the ultimate race to find out who is going to be the fastest & furious in the world. We in Belgium have just one little request. Please contract again Vin Diesel and Paul Walker because they are the only one capable to give an extra dimension to the cult of FAST AND THE FURIOUS.

9.0,The Best of the Three!,"Out of the first three movies, this film is definitely the best. I am not ripping the first two films, but this film has more to it. The actors are not as good as the first two, but the story is better.This is about Sean, a high-school student who always gets into trouble because of street racing. He eventually gets shipped off to live with his dad in Tokyo. While there, he gets involved in more street racing. But, he has to watch out for one lethal racer and his uncle.As I mentioned before, the acting is not as good as the first two. I still liked the actors. Lucas Black did a nice job. I thought the Asian actors did a wonderful job.The cars, ladies, stunts, etc are very, very good. The sound effects were fantastic especially during the final racing scene. Great music, too! Overall, this is the best of the series. I can't wait to see the fourth installment. I rate this movie 9/10.",g-bodyl,2009-06-13,2009
3.0,May this be the last movie of this series,"""If You Ain't Outta Control, You Ain't In Control."" Who comes up with these taglines? Are you serious? What terrible advice for anyone. I can just imagine a father telling his son, ""if you ain't outta control, you ain't in control"". Thanks to that advice your son is now a delinquent.One of my worries when I watch movies is that the movie will be predictable. Of course a lot of movies you expect to be predictable and it doesn't detract from the movie because of how well the movie is done. Everyone knew the Titanic would sink and that movie made a billion dollars. Tokyo Drift on the other hand was predictable and horribly done. I guess the producers got tired of suped up Japanese cars in America so they moved the action to Japan and figured the change of scenery would make the movie fresh. No. Everything played out virtually the same down to the American car being used at the end.",view_and_review,2008-06-15,2008
5.0,Logic is not this movie's strong suit,"I can't help myself. Continuing my quest to see all of the movies in this franchise, I got through Tokyo Drift. Let me just say that I enjoyed it very much, although I am still baffled by the story lines in these movies. You have to set your logic-meter at absolutely zero to enjoy these flicks. Even though there are almost none of the original cast members who appear in this, I thought that the star did an okay job once you get past his thick southern accent. Kudos to him for having enough integrity not to alter it. Speaking of accents there is one thing that I can't forgive and that is the girl's Australian accent. Even though there is a half-assed explanation of her mother being Australian, she was born in Japan. Was she born in captivity and was never allowed to leave her house. It's also explained that her mother left her to live with her boyfriend's family. Maybe I am making too much of this as usual. I was a language major. There are also an extraordinary amount of Japanese kids with American accents besides Lucas' best friend, Han and of course there is a black kid who is of course a thief. This I can half believe but are there really that many Americans in one school? As I said, these are not the questions you should ask yourself but enjoy the film for what it's worth. Unfortunately, it's not worth that much. This definitely falls in the category: ‘It's so bad, it's good. What do we have here: 1) A kid who is destined to go to juvenile hall if his father doesn't look after him 2) A father who gives him a hard time about rules, then decides to completely ignore them at the end 3) A mother who looks like she has been through the mill over and over (that was uncalled for) - A Japanese kid with a chip on his shoulder, who of course has ties to the Yakuza 4) Another Japanese kid (with the American accent) who of course is more than willing to help our hero because, hey, what else is there to do on the weekend 5) The love interest (I actually liked the line: ‘Hey, what does it matter where I am from’, which is pretty ironic) 6) The uncle from the Yakuza who concerns the villain. Speaking of that, everybody in this movie looks so concerned throughout this whole thing. Were they afraid that this movie wasn't going to make any money? There is also an abundance of meaningful looks between the characters that almost gave me a heart attack from laughing. Now, now. I shouldn't be so critical. After all, the filmmakers do put on a good show here. I should almost give this 5 out of 10 just for giving me all those laughs. What the hell, I'll do it.",policy134,2015-07-06,2015
10.0,Destined to be a Cult Classic,"Tokyo Drift is going to be one of those love it, hate it movies, much like 2001: A Space Odyssey and other cult classics. For those who are in to cars, this movie much like the first of the series brings a never-before-seen aspect of car driving to the silver screen. The drifting scenes are revolutionary and exciting; it may be remembered as the Bullit of the 21st century. It may do for drifting what the other previous two series did for tuning. That is bringing it out of the underground and making it more mainstream. Unlike other director who might of taken the short-cut and the easy way out of using CG to create the drift scenes. Director Justin Lin actually used real drivers and cars, which helps to bring a level of realism not found in other films. Justin Lin also accomplishes that he is so adapt at, that is portraying a part of Asian youth culture that the general public usually doesn't now see.The story itself is a trial and trued pattern of forbidden romance. Although the plot may lack originality, it is far from boring. But the focus of the film is on the cars and the driving and not on the plot. I think this is where the film gets into trouble with critics who lack the appreciation of the cars and the driving scenes. Many reviewers get lost in trying to find something from this film that is not meant to be there. If you want they want something mind opening, watch Brokeback Mountain. If you want to watch a movie for exciting and great action/driving scenes that you wouldn't be ashamed to talk to your friends about, watch this movie.",liubhs02,2006-06-27,2006
5.0,Solid entry to the franchise,"This one is tough for me to rate because it has some interesting ideas in it, but not all of it works for me. Unfortunately I don't like Lucas Black as Sean Boswell especially his accent was really annoying me. The whole story of the American highschool kid getting tangled up with the Japanese mafia also isn't 100% believable. What saves this for me is the racing aspect of this movie. The actual racing sequences and seeing the whole training that goes into becoming a good racer was really enjoyable. The stand out character here is Han who really made his case here for being brought back for later movies of this franchise as they eventually did. Overall I can neither love nor hat this movie, but it does enough to have a fun time watching.",tk_ew,2024-05-31,2024
10.0,It was a great movie!,This movie was the best!! I am so going to buy it when it comes out! I think the writers of the movie should make many more of Fast and the Furious movies and the next 1 should have Paul Walker!!Vin Diesel! nd Lucas Black!!!!! all in the same movie. That would be so0o0 awesome nd it should be in Europe!!! That would be great!Well everybody told me they enjoyed this movie nd so did I. Well I really am going to be waiting for another one coming out.. with Lucas Black in it. Man was Lucas Black hot in this movie!!Well yea I'm really going to buy this movie without a doubt on my mind!I mean the cars were hot and everything was hot in this movie!,Dlife921,2006-06-17,2006
5.0,the movie was OK until,"Van diesel showed up at the end ,tought now the movie starts then it ended damn too bad this movie isn't any good without him. I found the story too be boring and just watched the races. The storyline is just not OK ,seems that they just glued some things together without a real story line. This movie really missed a great storyline ,thats where van diesel had to jump in ,not in the end of the movie. Well overall not a movie to watch in the theaters. If u like racing just watch it at home but don't expect too much from it ,you can drink a beer when u watch it ,or chat with some friends you wont miss a thing. part 4 ,diesel come back please :-)",erik28,2006-08-04,2006
10.0,Action packed,"OK so is Tokyo Drift worth watching???? Well I can honestly say..Yes Tokyo Drift is worth watching, the car's are amazing, the acting isn't really up to that good of a standard but in all yes it's worth a watch! The plot serves the movie well, a kid moves from America to Tokyo after having trouble in America, some people say that it made for a crap plot but to be honest it makes for a good plot, better than any others movies that are coming out of Hollywood these days! In all I rate the movie a great 10/10, Go see the movie and watch those cars burn some rubber! Tokyo Drift has great effects with great motors, if you don't see this movie then you will regret it in the future so if I was you get your cinema tickets quick before it's taken from the big screen and released on DVD cause there's nothing like watching a film of this kind anywhere!",gazzalere,2006-08-08,2006
4.0,"Visually, very stunning. As for the plot? Well...","OK, I've only seen bits and pieces of the first two in the ‘Fast and the Furious’ franchise. What makes this movie watchable is that it's very fast-paced, there are good action scenes, including some of the best four-wheel drifts you'll ever see. The girls are nice eye candy if you're of the Asian persuasion. What does all this mean? It means you could hit the mute button and have the same sense of satisfaction out of watching this, in fact probably better, than if you actually pay attention to such meaningless props as dialogue and plot. Basically, some Alabama hick gets into a drag race while competing for a girl and gets one too many moving violations, so his single mom ships him off to Tokyo to live with his dad. Of course, they love racing over there too and he tries to fit in over there while keeping his love for drifting hidden from his dad. The infighting with his Japanese peers, chasing the king Japanese drifters' girl and confrontation with the Japanese dude's mafia family all seem way too contrived. But the scenes of Tokyo are visually stunning. Basically, ‘The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift’ delivers like a bad horror movie -- you know it's not a good flick but you can't stop watching for the visual effects. I give it a 4 out of 10.",Phillemos,2006-11-18,2006
10.0,Tokyo Drift,"‘The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift’ is the third of the F&F movies; it delivers all the races and crashes you could possibly desire, and a little more. After only one day in school, Sean (Lucas Black) is offered a customized street speedster, and is racing down the ramps of a parking garage against the malevolent D.K. The racing strategy is called ‘drifting.’ It involves sliding sideways while braking and accelerating, and the races involve a lot of hairpin turns. The movie ends with a warning that professional stunt drivers were used, and we shouldn't try this ourselves. Like the stunt in ‘Jackass’ where the guy crawls on a rope over an alligator pit with a dead chicken hanging from his underwear, it is not the sort of thing likely to tempt me.",tipharris12,2006-06-28,2006
3.0,Lots of cars but no real people,"If you liked the first two movies in the saga, you will probably not like this one. And the reason is that Fast & Furious is not just about fast cars, but about characters with charisma, and their story. Not just nice cars driving as fast as possible by empty - headed characters. You cannot find any single good performance in the whole movie, any single character with at least a gram of personality. The plot is absolutely dumb and predictable and you do not really worry about whatever happens to the characters. You will enjoy this film if you only want to see fast cars, nice women with too small dresses, and techno - music that not fits the scenes. I f you are looking for something more, watch the first movie in the saga.",sergio-arauzo,2014-09-05,2014
5.0,"fast cars, fast women, no plot","Well first off the cars were awesome,Tokyo looked awesome the girls were hot,, but the plot just plain sucked.

The music was fast and fun, loved the girls little outfits t hat reveal practically everything, i like the Yakuza references in the movie. i just think that the plot could have been way better, and they needed someone else please in the lead role. overall, see it for the cars, the girls, the music, but don't see it for the plot, because you will be disappointed.",kairingler,2007-10-09,2007
9.0,Turns out I am a red blooded male!!,"I saw the very first Fast and The Furious a lot of years ago and I only remember I didn't like it at all. I'm just not a car guy, I don't known the difference between an engine block and a car stump and Nascar or any car racing usually bores me to tears. I never even bothered seeing the second installment of this series and I had no desire at all to see this third one despite my love for movies which eventually is what caused me to see it. I had nothing else to see and I really wanted to go to the movies so there I was sitting in the theater and all car movies are usually described as ‘High Octane’ but Fast and The Furious Tokyo Drift defines that!! How great is it when a film you have such low expectations of turns out to be incredible?? That's exactly what happened for me with this film. Not only are the car race and chase scenes edge of your seat, beautifully and brilliantly choreographed, but the story is really good!! The performances from the cast are also really good. It was an all around great movie that is definitely worthy of a night out. Lucas Black who has done some great work as of recently in Jarhead, and Cold Mountain plays country boy who loves his cars Sean Boswell. Black plays Boswell like the absolutely perfect hero. He's rough, tough, don't mess with him, but at the same time, loyal, handsome, even suave in a country kind of way. And on top of that he's completely out of his element by dropping into the high speed world of Tokyo street racing and Tokyo in general. Such a huge part of the greatness of this film is seeing this boy completely out of his element determined to win back the thing he knows best...racing. He's never quite the underdog but you absolutely root for him. Black does a really great job and I think this film could really be a stepping stone for him to leading man status. Newcomer Nathalie Kelley plays Black's love interest, and racing fanatic herself Neela. Now for an actress, especially a newcomer to hold her own in an absolutely testosterone driven film is pretty impressive and she does exactly that. I still wouldn't say her performance is fem-powered, I mean the girls are still somewhat trivialized as ‘car-babes’ but for the only leading female role she does very well. Her and Black's character have good strong chemistry and she drives with the best of them when you finally see her behind the wheel. I am positive you haven't seen the last of Nathalie Kelley. Bow Wow (formerly Lil) plays hustler Twinkie (Twink.) I have to say that Bow Wow is not one of the stronger performances in the film. He does alright but he is definitely overshadowed but strong performances by Black in the lead role and the other characters around him. His character I think is a lot weaker than the others and it makes it hard to be a decent role. Mostly a TV actor Brian Tee plays bad guy/tough guy D.K. (Drift King.) He is absolutely excellent as the bad guy, even though he does come across as something of a schmuck, I think that's the idea. He is the perfect contrast and adversary to Black's Sean Boswell. D.K. is everything that Boswell isn't and has his girl, his talent, and his cars. I would like to see Tee in a hardcore bad guy role in the future, he was excellent and you hated him but knew it was going to be fun to watch him get his in the end. Sung Kang is terrific as D.K.'s business partner but also adversary secretly. Kang plays Han who immediately takes to Sean Boswell and brings him aboard convinced he is a trustworthy person to have on his side which definitely turns out to be true. Kang's performance is subtle, quiet, but really good. He is a mentor and kind of an anti-hero in many ways. Great performance!! Director Justin Lin captures the Asian street world in such a way that it just draws you in. Scenes of Tokyo alone are stunning and seeing Lucas Black's character dealing with not only the street world but school and every day life in a completely foreign atmosphere gives this film so much more than just car racing. It has such depth and really an interesting and powerful movie. I don't know if it's action or drama but somewhere in the middle is something that for a third installment to a series about car racing is so impressive!! And even myself NOT being a fan of the series the twist surprise cameo at the end was awesome and brought a smile to my face since there was no real connection to the other films until that moment. Beginning to end it locked me in and left me on the edge of my seat with amazing performances, terrific scenery and direction and great characters. Absolutely worthy of seeing!! I may even go back and try the first two again in honor of this one. 9/10",Robert_duder,2006-06-30,2006
3.0,Stupid and Predictable,"The story is about a messed up teenager (don't really know *why* he's so messed up, though) who can't get out from behind a wheel. This gets him constantly into trouble. Eventually with the Yakuza, no less. Trouble tends to start with a girl. Just about every punk kid in this film is young, dumb and full of cum. If they catch you so much as talking to their girl, that means she's probably sleeping with you so you gotta die. That's basically the impression I got watching this nonsense. The characters (wait... who else but the messed up kid was acting?) are not well-developed and the plot, I think, has many holes. I would not recommend this film. Waste your time on something else.",knight_armour,2008-09-28,2008
10.0,Oh Yea!!!,"The Fast and The Furious:Tokyo Drift was by far the best Fast and the Furious installment made. It is packed with exciting race scenes and a good story. Although I found some parts to be a little corny, it had no effect on my overall enjoyment while watching this movie, and i never felt bored at any point in the movie. The action was accompanied by a great selection of music which added to the ""feel"" of the movie. If you have not seen this movie yet, I suggest going out and watching it ASAP. You can't go wrong with loud cars, lots of women, and good music. If you enjoyed the last couple parts of the series, I'm sure this one won't let you down. And if you do watch and don't like it, I think you might be crazy!!!",sethcooper06,2006-06-24,2006
5.0,"It is Watchable, but not terribly exciting. Lucas Black is no substitute for Paul Walker, that's for sure.","(Plot) Alienated teenager Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) Moves to Tokoyo in order to avoid jail time, and moves in with his strict Father. This makes matter worse as Sean becomes involved in the world of street racing. When you can't even sign Paul Walker to star in this movie, you kinda know things are getting pretty dire. It's actually not as bad as you might fear. It certainly kept my interest for the most part, and it never truly bored me, but it just didn't generate nearly enough excitement for me. The cars are stylish and beautiful to look at as per usual, but all the machismo and the cool attitude faded away quickly for me. Paul Walker is not a great actor, but he did have presence, which is something I can't say for Lucas Black. He wasn't terrible by any means, just rather mundane if you know what I mean. I also had trouble getting sympathy from his character. It lacks a menacing villain, even though the streets of Tokyo are rather enticing, it didn't live up to the potential it had in the beginning. It does have a pretty sweet scene in a parkade though. Some of the car stunts are pretty awesome. P.S Vin Diesel has a cameo at the very end. I have to admit it was pretty neat Final Thoughts: Believe it or not. I actually dig a lot of this series. I enjoyed 1,2 & 5. I haven't seen the latest one, but I have a blast with them for what they are. This lacks the pizazz and the thrills that a lot of this series does. It's worth watching once, but you may feel rather underwhelmed. Never thought I'd pine for Paul Walker",callanvass,2013-09-08,2013
4.0,The best of all 4 Fast & Furious movies.,"They finally got it right...it's about time...No annoying actors, no hype, no cliché rap soundtrack, a director that actually knows how to film a movie and a writer than can tell an interesting story and most importantly cars that are cool and races that are fun to watch. OK so I might've built it up to make it sound perfect, but it wasn't - but way better than the others. The plot is different completely. A 17 year old kid is always getting in trouble, but the last time he does was the final straw, he gets sent to live with his estranged father in Tokyo in hopes of calming down. But no, some kid hands him the keys to a $100 grand car and says hey lets see if you can drive it really fast and win against the best racer in Tokyo...Okay he didn't literally say that, but it was basically what he did. So In Tokyo they do this weird racing where they don't cut corners, they slide around them a.k.a. ‘drifiting’. So yea young American boy gets really good and yadda yadda you all know the rest. you see why I don't give these movies high ratings… OK So Justin Lin is an okay director at least he tries and has heart for it, Chris Morgan wrote this and changed it up a lot. The film was set in Japan obviously so that gave it an entirely different feel, which was great. The style is so much different and the people are so much different. They still have funny looking little cars and play rap music, but hey theses funny little cars come from there and their rap music is better because its not full of guys talking about stupid stuff and yelling over and over. Acting is so much better. Lucas Black is the star and he is a country boy, he doesn't try to act cool or fit in, and you can tell he is that way in real life, he doesn't try at all and it's very natural. The cliché rapper was Bow Wow here, and let's face it he's not relevant enough to be considered as a rapper and he can act okay too, not great I said okay. Great work from Asian actors Brian Tee as the bad guy DK and the co-star of the film Sung Kang as Han. Of course the legendary and great Sonny Chiba as Dk's mafia uncle was just a a perfect casting choice. Although it has a lot of good acting it did have some bad ones, most notably Zachary Bryan. Zach played a similar role on Smallville and as far back as Home Improvement I have hated this guy, you can tell in real life he would be that guy, that jock bully 'better than everyone' type of guy. Here he is playing it and gets what he deserves. Also Vin Diesel makes a cameo at the very end...can't we go a whole movie without having to see a horrible actor from the other films? It was the best of the 4, but it still wasn't that great. I would only recommend this one to anyone who asked of the series. I gave it only one star more than the first two, but hey I didn't see anything truly amazing here..",pkzeewiz,2010-04-15,2010
9.0,I liked it!,"It may not win an Oscar but i liked it, very much!Don't expect a good story, cuz it doesn't make any sense. Don't expect good actors, cuz thay suck ,specially the main guy. Don't expect being on ""the edge of your seat"", cuz there is a few boring parts.Do expect cars. fast, new and beautiful cars. Do expect special effect, cuz there is a lot from where they came from. Do expect good music, hip hap music that will sound good in your car when the movie will release on DVD's.To sum up, take your best friends and enjoy a 2 hours of fun. If you crazy about cars, you going to love it.peace!",mar741,2006-06-29,2006
4.0,Nod,"The movie tries to go back and catch the essence of the first movie. It might not (really) have any actors from the previous installments, but the ""Fast & Furious"" feeling is there ... and wait til the end for a little surprise (unless someone told you or you read it, you won't really expect it).The thing is, the stunts are top notch, really good. But the story doesn't carry through Lucas Black seems to loathe every minute he is on screen, while cursing his agent, who got him the role(?). Even Paul Walker felt more ""right"" in the franchise. If you wanna fast forward and watch the stunts, you might add a point or two to my vote.",kosmasp,2009-08-11,2009
8.0,Much Better than I Expected,"I fought with my friends to not see this movie. I begged, pleaded, and stomped my feet. Then, I gave in and loved it. Compared to the other two, this movie is alone. I loved the driving. I loved the acting and the character interaction. I even loved the cars, thought I am definitely a muscle fan. My heart did sink a bit when the Nissan engine got put in the beautiful Ford Mustang. But that has nothing to do with this. I really felt something when one of the characters died, as did, I believe, everyone in the theater. The acting really is superb. The end was a touch cheesy and the last 15 seconds does tie the 3 movies together well, but I say, ‘Forget those others then you see this movie.’ Enjoy this beauty of a racing movie.",MysteryMovieMan,2006-06-27,2006

4.0,The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift Review,"The Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift(2006) Starring: Lucas Black, Shad Moss, Nathalie Kelley, Brian Tee, Suang Kang, Brian Goodman, Sonny Chiba, Leonardo Nam, Jason Tobin, Keiko Kitagawa, Alden Villaverde, Koji Kataoka, Kevin Ryan, Lynda Boyd, and Vin Disel Directed By: Justin Lin Review On the streets of Tokyo, speed needs no translation... You know I was never big fan of the whole Fast & Furious franchise until I saw five then they made six which I did not see, and seven which I will see even though I said I wasn't going too, because I love watching films no matter what and I want to respect Paul Walker. But Fast Five will always remain as one of my favorite films of all time and my second favorite high powered car film, my first is Speed Racer. This third entry from the series is when people became curious of the franchise, it revolves around a guy who gets kicked out of America for street racing and moves in with his dad in Tokyo. When he gets there he meets a group of people who are drifters, one in particular is the Drift king. You see Han from the fifth film(snacking as usual) and he likes the kid so he teaches him how to drift. Han is also stealing money from the Drift king and he wants to take down and his new prodigy with speed in the fast lane. The film wasn't all that fun which is what these movies are meant to be, their meant to be fun action movies . But the only fun out of this film like the first two is the street racing. That's it. Not any fights, not any characters, not even any shoot outs. This film just lacked the amount of fun you would want in an action film. The performances in this film are as bland as butter, the only one who seemed to be trying where Suang Kang and Brian Tee they were the only ones I bought in this movie. Everyone else is just bland or terrible. Don't even get me started on Bow Wow, the credit shows him as Shad Moss being the actors name but my TV said Bow Wow so I think LetterBox is wrong on that. But yeah he was the worst thing about this movie. The Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift does have cool car sequences but also a watered down and uninteresting plot, bad acting and characters you can't get into, I'm giving this drifter a two out of five.",Spideyfan-963-246215,2016-09-09,2016
10.0,Most entertaining movie this summer,"Superman, Nacho Libre, Devil Wears Prada, Pirates of the Caribbean, of all movies released this summer, this was the only one I never found myself falling asleep to. Enough action and semblance of plot to keep you entertained for the whole duration. Sonny Chiba brings a great vibe to this movie, and Bow Bow was surprisingly enjoyable (when compared to his unoriginal, irritating ""counterpart"" Lil Romeo). I would see the 4th one, Tokyo was probably the perfect setting for the racing, and the drift stunts were excellently executed. Lucas Black does a good job being the jerk that you either love or hate. The beginning of the movie alone is worth the price of admission, if only to see the kid from Home Improvement get messed up. I think the younger audience (15-30 year olds) will find it easy to identify with some of the characters in the movie, albeit without so much of the underground mob-influences. Go see this movie, it is easily the best in the franchise, and there is no Paul Walker (pre-Running Scared) to drastically irritate the experience.",wolverine296,2006-07-09,2006
4.0,Woeful,"Superman IV: The Quest For Peace and Jaws IV: The Revenge are two movies considered to be so poor, they are thought to be ""Franchise Killers"".The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift or ""The Fast And The Furious 3"" for those that are counting should be known as a franchise killer. God knows it is worse than both Superman IV and Even Jaws IV. Plot In A Paragraph: Sean Boswell is an American teenager, he is a loner in school, however he challenges his rival for an illegal street racing, and he totals his car in the end of the race. To avoid time in prison he is sent to Tokyo to live with his father who is in the military. As soon as he arrives he discovers a new, fun but dangerous way of street racing in the underworld of the streets of Tokyo, Japan.Sung Kang is the only actor to emerge with any credit, as the acting is woeful all round. The cameo by Vin Deisel is the movies only bright spot.",slightlymad22,2015-04-02,2015

I don't know about you but how is a car film a family favourite? god damn it. i hate this film but still i give it a 10 out of 10 for being in Tokyo.",liammapswaw,2015-04-30,2015
3.0,This movie was awful,"How do the movie makers convince the money men to send them to a place like Tokoyo and totally destroy a tried and true action series like F&F with big $$. The hero, can't get out of his way in a US public school, is supposed to be casted as white trailer trash, but then speaks fluent Japanese and attends a private school, for what army brats, and has no issues??. Magically, has absolutely no problem with driving on the wrong side of the road(just turned 18), and is allowed to destroy what $80,000 in autos belonging to a guy he just met? Pluease, The damsel in distress has the sex appeal of a small rock ( and I love pretty girls in school uniforms) and we are supposed to believe that she would ever deal with a local thug(s) who make their money how exactly (everyone is drinking soda). This should have been a R rating with tremendously sexy Japanese Girls and ADULTS making all the bad decisions. What did we learn? That it is OK to destroy hundreds of thousands of newly constructed homes in the USA, thousands of dollars worth of cars, with absolutely NO ramifications?. Oh yeah, and that you have to do fish tails around young Japaneses girls in their own hot cars to Just get their phone Number. TOO shallow, Too Unbelievable, and TOO typical a climax to the Movie.

9.0,Much better than Anticipated!,"I expected this time around it would be like most other sequels, when the main cast are no longer present, that it is a last ditch effort to milk a couple of more dollars out of the name. Was I wrong! It contained a well thought out and original storyline, and is bringing a virtually unknown type of racing into mainstream (unless you are a die-hard racer). I have known about drifting for years, but almost anyone I have mentioned it to have never heard of it.I am 33, and my father of 54 both thought that it likely had the some of the best car chases in movie history! Well thought out, very original and really nothing like the first 2. After 2 Fast 2 Furious turned out to be less than stellar, they have breathed new life into this nameplate, and really hope to see another installment. It has some extremely interesting twists which is totally surprising and welcomed.I am definitely recommending seeing this if you liked the first 2 at all!",JohnD-Keane,2006-06-15,2006
8.0,Great entertainment! A great step up for the series.,"This movie RULES.I honestly don't understand the people who hated it. Yes, there is a good deal of very poor acting. Yes, the story is pretty stupid. Yes, everything about this movie is contrived... but honestly, are any of these surprising? Did we not expect this? The fact is, this movie stands head and shoulders above 2 Fast, 2 Furious. I do not believe that is an opinion. The acting is better, the story is better, the characters are more believable, the production value is FAR better... none of these are stellar by any means, but what you end up with is solid entertainment. As long as you know what you're looking at, you will laugh, whether they meant you to or not.I'm not sure if I enjoyed it more than the first F&F, but it's definitely a fun movie. Don't go looking for something believable, and don't expect a deep, involving story -- just go to be entertained, and I can almost guarantee you'll at least get a good laugh.There are definitely negatives, though. The acting is not good. Not awful, but not good. The female lead looks like Michael Jackson. I mean dog ugly. The plot is very simple, and not exactly involving.The positives, obviously, are the details. The races are certainly fun to watch; a LOT of the really stupid things (like, well, all the dialogue) can be really entertaining as long as you're not taking them seriously. There's a lot of idiocy that car people will catch and laugh at -- my knowledge of auto mechanics is mediocre, but I still got some great laughs out of this film. E-brake drifting in RWD cars... if you get it, you'll enjoy it.Overall... watch this movie to be entertained. I'm not disappointed; I'm glad I saw it on the big screen, and once it's out on DVD, I will definitely be obtaining a copy.7.5/10",etzool,2006-06-24,2006
9.0,"This is what I wanted see, a film that lives up to its name Tokyo Drift. Nothing more, nothing less","I went to this film for one thing and one thing only to watch drift racing, I'm a rally fan and drifting is the coolest part of the rallies. This film is tagged as Tokyo Drift and lives up to its name. You want a good plot and a great story this ain't for you its that simple. Go to this film and watch some of the best driving sequences you have ever witnessed and you won't be disappointed. My rating of 9 out of 10 is for the races and thats about all. This is the best by far of the Fast and the Furious trilogy when it comes to the racing sequences, but as stated earlier I'm a drift fan. The special effects were good, and there is a interesting surprise at the end of the film, that makes me see a possible 4th film in the franchise.

10.0,It was H O T,"The movie was great. Although I do think that it was kind of loosely based on a bad attitude Initial D movie. But all in all it was definitely the best Fast and The Furious movie compared to it's predecessors. If Paramount is willing to make another one, they should definitely aim for something like this one. I was kind of getting sick and tired of the same Nitros powered vehicles / rims bigger than the door of their cars, and it's drivers wanting to just go straight and think that's the best. As humans (and street hood rat racers) we all know that ""in life"" it has it's path of ups and downs and lefts and rights, sharp curves, and hairpins or what not.

9.0,It was great except for one minor detail,I went to the fast and the furious with a friend of mine and he is as skeptical as they get. But i did bring him and when the movie started i was like oke....... well lets hope they skip to japan FAST. and they did :D so now i was really hyped and only saw an old white dude :(. From here on it got real good real fast as the main character went to school *Asian schoolgirls :D~* but i really lost my mind when they entered the garage at the first race i had died and made it into heaven only to be blast into hell for the total carnage one of the cars got :'( but it was a great race. i like all the racing scenes and really loved the *some people say thin* story line within the movie that has really dramatic twists in it it also gives a good view of the way the respect counts in japan and how outsiders are usually treated there. only part where there was a slip up is the part where he changes from his red 4wd evo to the black fr mustang which is pretty hard to master as you are driving a totally different car. if the roles where reversed i wouldn't have complained but for this minor detail i had to take of a point so that is why i gave it a 9 i would REALLY REALLY like people to judge the movie in an honest way because i really really really loved it *maybe its my fetish with Asian women and Asian cars and drifting all combined in one movie* but its really great.

8.0,Fast and the Furious: Tokoyo Drift,"Fast, beautiful cars, sexy Asians, and fights....Does that interest you? Because that's what this movie is. Nothing else though since there is no plot.The plot is for some reason the main guy is moved to Tokoyo. In Tokoyo he meets a guy who shows him underground racing, there he is introduced to drifting. He tries racing and gets his ass handed to him. So for most of the movie he does pointless drifting and hitting on this guys girl. His uncle(that he lives with in Tokoyo) doesn't like him driving, but then he ends up letting him do the most dangerous race at the end.The acting alright. The emotion at times was bad, and the main character was absolutely dreadful. Yay, let's put a total hick with a huge accent as the main character and put him with a bunch of Chinese people who can only have two emotions. Mad and calm.The cars were beautiful, as were the girls that were bending over the cars. They choreography of the racing and stuff was very well done, and it looked quite real, so were the crashes.Overall the movie was pretty cool, but a bad plot, but I'd watch it again.",typhill,2006-06-25,2006
10.0,Earns the BS stamp of excellence,"Going into this movie, the third fast and the furious i expected a couple of things: 1. fast paced action 2. hot woman but what this installment gives you is that and a whole lot more. It has a deeper plot than the first two and dives deeper into the characters to let you know (or guess) what is happening or what is going to happen and on top of that it even gives you ""quoteable quotes"" to remember the movie by. I enjoyed the way the movie was shot referring to the showing of scenes and then aciton and then scenes but i don't want to give anything away. Other than that it is an excellent summer film that shows you a good time but even makes you think with a good story line and some inner twists.

10.0,my opinion,"I think this movie is great! English's foreign language to me so I apologize if there'll be some mistakes... Cars, girls, style, drift - that are the main things in the movie and I liked it very much. However, the movie's not just 'bout exterior, it's 'bout fight, 'bout finding one's way out, 'bout getting accustomed to a new environment, 'bout life. If you would have asked a racer or a drifter what a car means to him, he would have said - it's my life, it's my style, it's my everything, it's me, myself and I. A great movie! Really great! And I liked the ending very much too. The part when Vin Diesel came and said he wanna race... I can't wait to see the fourth part of the movie... I'm looking forward to see it.",roman-pelt,2006-08-30,2006
8.0,It is a very entertaining movie.,"OK, I walked in expecting another fake street racing movie. The first Fast and the Furious was quite entertaining. The second just felt like a 90 minute commercial sponsored by Mitsubishi and Yearone. Honestly, this movie was really great, it felt really good to watch. You can really connect with the main character(Lucas Black). I dunno, you can sense a lot of sincerity in his character. He loves what he does and thats it. The jump from drag to drifting doesn't seem to really get to him. The fact that this movie doesn't rely on the cars as the main characters is really great. The acting itself in this movie was wonderful. I love watching a good classic movie just like the rest, but sometimes you just need to see some mindless car scenes and unwind a bit. Oh, the other thing I loved was the cameos! We have the original drift king with his one liners. Funny. We also have the so ever popular Sonny Chiba(aka the swordsman from Kill Bill). Last and not least, Vin Diesel is back",jin_ecko72,2006-06-18,2006
9.0,Flashier version of it's predecessors,"""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" is the first two movies plus more. There's a new ""hero"", which is a nice change for some. The hero is supposedly 17, but it's pretty obvious he's actually much older in real life. =P His name is Sean, and he seems to get into trouble a lot. He's moved from town to town because of racing, and now he's gone to Tokyo, Japan. While there, he learns about a new kind of racing called ""drifting"". He makes a few new friends, and gets into it. This movie has LOTS of racing and some BAD ASS cars. If you liked the first two, you're going to LOVE this one.

10.0,The fats and the furious Tokyo drift,"I saw fast and the furious Tokyo drift today it was an excellent movie and i'd love to see it again. It did include Vin Diesel although he wasn't a main character it least the director tried to include him. The cars were gorgeous and i thought while i was watching it i want to be like them i want to be a car racer. Which i've always wanted to do but now i want to be a racer even more. Of course these films must influence people like me to want to be like them and race cars and drift. But also it makes you change your mind as Han, Shawns friend dies in it which made me want to cry. He died when they were racing and D.K was racing after them. Then the car was burning and Shawn was walking up to it and it exploded. This was the saddest part of the movie. The movie was fantastic and when i buy it on DVD i'm probably going to be up watching it every night! They had fantastic cars in the movie my favourite was the Nissan 350Z which D.K at the beginning of the movie drove. The cars were gorgeous and when i'm 17 i'm going to have my driving test in a Nissan 350Z on my birthday. To sum the movie up it was a brilliant movie and there was some gorgeous guys and cars. Also the music was great and i hope they bring out a soundtrack for the film. Lucas Black was always fantastic in this movie as well as Nathalie Kelley i hope the next one comes out soon and the DVD comes out soon because i want to watch it every day. I also hope Lucas Black and Nathalie Kelley are in the next ones. Also Lucas Black seemed more tough then Paul Walker. Thankyou for your co-operation. If you have not yet seen the movie. SEE IT!!! Its the best one so far! Its also my favourite movie ever now!!!!!!",igraynelewis,2006-06-17,2006
10.0,Sweet,"OMG! This movie was totally amazing. Sweet looking cars, the drifting, the story line of it all and everything. I am totally in love with this movie! It's the best one yet. Only thing is I would of like to of seen Paul Walker and Lucas Black. Vin Diesel was a group pump at the end. To bad they didn't actually full out race and we as an audience didn't get to see it. I hope they make a movie off of that one.I would give anything to watch this movie over and over 24/ 7. This movie is definitely being bought. There is so much action it keeps you on your toes , especially the final race on the mountain.WAY INTENSE! I definitely don't like the way the Japanese do things though that's for sure. It's most like they need to cheat to win and such. The first race we see before he moves was so intense. My adrenaline was sky rocketed. Amazing stunts in there.

9.0,Danm,"I just loved!!!!, music was fantastic and out of the three so far it been the best one. And the Women where hot. Lil Bow wow was total out of character reminded me too much of Tyrese in the way he talked. I didn't particularly like the accents on the leading female and leading male. Seemed a bit over board. My heart cried when the RX7 got destroyed as well as the Fairlady Though I personally think they should have used Paul Walker and bring back the Brian character back instead and have him reunite with Dom in the end and that would leave a opening for the fourth one where Brian and Dom roam the Toyko streets. Now if and when the fourth on comes out, man it'd going to be off the hook.",dmanero,2006-06-16,2006
8.0,tokyo drift,"The cast of the third movie, which has a different atmosphere than the first two series, includes new actors and new locations. First of all, the director of the series has changed again, Lucas Black plays the leading role, there are also prominent people in supporting roles, but I did not know anyone in the cast. Lucas Black's performance was okay, but he was too old to be a high school student under eighteen, D. K. He did justice to his evil character, but he was also very repulsive, the Han character was good. Unlike the first two films, the production takes place in Japan. Shaun, who had to go to Japan to his father because of a car race that ended in an accident at school, will try to establish himself here and beat the drift king. The movie starts with an average car race that starts with a trivial reason, and then moves on to the drift-filled nights of Tokyo. Although the script had no weight and was full of clichés, the racing scenes were very good, especially the chase before the finale and the final race were memorable, and both the Six Days and Tokyo Drift tracks were good, the other music was not bad either.",burakgezzginci,2023-11-27,2023
8.0,It's honestly underrated.,"**Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift** - A Thrilling Yet Underrated Gem""Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,"" the third installment in the high-octane franchise, is often overlooked and underrated. However, it stands out with its unique setting, distinct storyline, and engaging car culture that deserves an 8/10 rating for its sheer entertainment value and innovative approach to the racing genre.Set against the vibrant backdrop of Tokyo, the film immerses viewers in a world of underground drift racing, a subculture known for its precision and artistry. Unlike its predecessors, ""Tokyo Drift"" departs from the familiar characters and locations, offering a fresh perspective and introducing a new protagonist, Sean Boswell, played by Lucas Black. Sean's journey from a troubled teen in America to a drift-racing sensation in Japan forms the crux of the narrative.One of the film's most vital points is its authentic depiction of Tokyo's urban landscape and the intricacies of drift racing. The cinematography captures the city's neon-lit streets and bustling energy, creating a visually stunning experience. The racing scenes are meticulously choreographed, showcasing the skill and finesse required for drift racing. The film does a commendable job of making these sequences thrilling and immersive, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats.Lucas Black's portrayal of Sean is earnest and relatable, even if it lacks the charisma of some of the franchise's other leads. His character's growth and adaptation to a new culture add depth to the storyline. Sung Kang's Han Lue, a fan-favorite, brings a sense of cool and calm to the chaotic world of drift racing, and his mentorship of Sean adds a layer of camaraderie and heart to the film.The supporting cast, including Bow Wow as Twinkie, provides moments of fun and grounding in an otherwise high-stakes environment. The film's antagonist, Takashi, played by Brian Tee, embodies the typical rival but with a nuanced performance that adds complexity to his character. The dynamic between Sean and Takashi drives much of the film's tension, culminating in a gripping climax.""Tokyo Drift"" is not without its flaws. The storyline can sometimes be predictable, and some character arcs feel underdeveloped. However, these shortcomings are overshadowed by the film's strengths. The soundtrack, featuring a mix of hip-hop and electronic beats, complements the fast-paced action and enhances the viewing experience.What truly sets ""Tokyo Drift"" apart is its celebration of car culture. The attention to detail in the vehicles, from classic muscle cars to sleek Japanese imports, is impressive. The film pays homage to the art of car modification and the passion of racing enthusiasts, making it a must-watch for automotive lovers.In retrospect, ""Tokyo Drift"" has aged well, gaining appreciation for its bold departure from the main storyline and its focus on a different aspect of the racing world. It serves as a bridge in the franchise, introducing elements and characters that become pivotal in later films.In conclusion, ""Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" may not have garnered the initial acclaim of its predecessors, but it deserves recognition for its unique contribution to the franchise. Its exhilarating racing sequences, authentic depiction of Tokyo, and deep dive into drift culture make it an underrated gem that merits an 8/10 rating. Whether you're a fan of the series or new to street racing, ""Tokyo Drift"" offers an engaging and visually captivating ride that shouldn't be missed.",zzbvrfwk,2024-06-27,2024
10.0,Great movie,"I've seen both the previous fast and furious movies and loved them. I think this one is definitely as good. Although i do miss Paul Walker, Lucas Black is definitely a good replacement and being younger adds something to the movies. The actual car scenes aren't as good as 2 Fast 2 Furious, but the storyline and acting quality make up for it. Also, Neela (Nathalie Kelley), Sean's girlfriend is amazing, much better than Eva Mendes or Michelle Rodriguez. The soundtrack is really good, the tunes suit the Japanese drifting scene especially the Teriyaki Boys, an actual Japanese band who produced a track called ""fast and furious"". To sum it up plenty of comedy, action and thrills, i really enjoyed it.",simranbarn987,2006-11-16,2006

8.0,worth it for the last 2 minutes.........,"all i can say is that the making of a #3 after a horrible #2 was worth it just to see the last 2 minutes...Everyone was ""like how can they make a #3... "" but it was worth it to see the cars, the action and a little fun. unlike the first two which focused on the people and their stories this one had the drama.... car crash after car crash. I think at the end you prayed you wouldn't wreck your car like that.I also love that like the others it had an awesome soundtrack.I do recommend the film to any one who wants some mindless fun entertainment.",bluesweetee,2006-06-26,2006
8.0,Great film,"Right this film was great except for some dumb kids behind me talking every 5 mins. Guess who was in the last 3mins of the film *this is my spoiler* Vin Diesel and guess what they refer to the ‘10 second car’. Anyway the main plot is: Shaun is a high school idiot working on being a mechanic, his life isn't worth living, the amount of mistakes he makes. He manages to talk to talk to a high school football players girl. The player wasn't happy. But Shaun trust got into his car and was willing to leave but o no the football player decided to throw a baseball threw the back window of shauns car. They are both not happy and want to fight but the girl says ‘settle your problems on the street’ So they do this would seem to be an unfair battle a Dodge Viper vs a Chevvy (i assume). They enter a building site (estate) and race.......At the end Shaun slams threw a house and flips his car but still wins. They both end up in a police station, this is where he gets shipped over to japan to live with his Navy uncle. The main rules that his uncle lays down is stay away from cars!, but this kid his petrol in his veins and within a day hes already in the drift scene. His first race is what should i say, ‘something to be desired’ be has never drifted before, so one of the men (high in the highracy) lends him his Nissan Silvia s14a and at the end of the race his car is totalled to a beer can. He then gets taught how to drift by Hans and his crew, he becomes an excellent drifter after 2 cars!. But then when all is going well Hans is killed by his mate for stealing from his uncles company. Shaun then decides to try to bargain with the major millionaire uncle. But the way they decided to settle it is (you guessed it) a drift race. But wait all of shauns cars got impounded by the police after a shootout. And the only car left is the beer can aka Nissan Silvia but with its custom made engine, they decide to take the engine and put it in a mustang that Shauns uncle has. In the end his opponents car is thrown off the road and Shaun wins gets his girl and then we see Vin! They both have a race then the movie ends :\ Sorry that was so patchy, dumb ass kids.",vapour-100,2006-06-16,2006
9.0,like a cigarette commercial,"I like it. And I don't need to write much to state why, because NFS, er, Tokyo Drift is a nice simple movie. It's about car racing - merged with every stylish and attractive means you can possibly get and polished to the aesthetic quality of cigarette commercials. Even the ""story"" is contributing to the whole, when set in the right perspective: It's just another color on the canvas, some ""manly"" simple metaphors on life to complete the picture of what you can dream about the speed and the car racing.Another nice consequence of Tokyo Drift having something in common with cigarette commercials: As you like cigarette commercials without being interested in the content, you don't have to like car racing, to be able to like the movie.All in all it's not perfect, but I think it's great and a good example of how to get something out of great looking scenes and pictures (and girls) without becoming artistic boredom.",patrick_ok,2006-07-14,2006
10.0,The Fast and The Furious's third installment may have changed location but it still is a well-put-together movie,"The third installment of The Fast and the Furious combines great action sequences and a strong plot to make a movie that may match the first Fast and the Furious. the races and chases through the Tokyo streets keep you on the edge of your seat the hole way through. Lucas Black delivers a spectacular performance of young teen who finds his calling under the tutelage of Han, a man of authority in the Tokyo underground. This film does live up to the standard set by the first Fast and the Furious. from an amateur vs. expert drifting race to a drifting chase through the streets of Tokyo, to a final climactic race down a mountain, the scenes are full of believable action. The audience goes on a adventure that will leave them wanting more. This movie is one of the best this summer and is a must-see.",Kieranmitch,2006-07-02,2006

8.0,The fast and the furious Tokyo drift,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) in my opinion I think is a solid good action sequel, a very bashed and hated in the series. Which I don't think this movie is bad, I think is a much better movie than Furious 7. I always loved this movie, I think it is a good movie, but in the series is not the worst one, but is far from worst one that would be Furious 7. I think it was a different solid, good sequel in the series and I love it for an action film. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a fun movie to watch: it accomplishes what it set out to do and that's provide the most realistic yet gravity-defying racing sequences, backed with the eye-catching background of the electrifying, neon Tokyo. Plot-wise it suffers a bit and the acting isn't top-notch, otherwise the loud music, import cars, cityscape Tokyo, and Japanese pop culture more than make up for the flaws of the film that you'll watch it again and again.Plot: When convicted street racer Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) tries to start a new life on the other side of the world, his obsession with racing sets him on a collision course with the Japanese underworld. To survive, he will have to master drifting-a new style of racing where tricked-out cars slide through hairpin turns, defying gravity and death for the ultimate road rush.This movie is more the highest-octane installment of the hit movie franchise built for speed! There are more mind-blowing stunts and heart-pounding racing sequences than ever, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift will put you in the driver's seat. ""Strap yourself in for a blistering, super-charged ride.""-- Pete Hammond, Maxim"" The CGI I am sorry but in one way it is terrible which I really did not like when Sean (Lucas Black) and Neela (Nathalie Kelley) are slide down with the car during the car chase and they cross over the crowd of people without hitting anyone, you can see the camera, that it is made with a CGI that is the only main problem I have with the film, the rest was okay. This is a very simple film, not a big confusing plot and again this films, you know 5,6 and 7 the plots are still pretty simplistic.5 was a heist movie, 6 was this guy the evil version of you, we want him to bring him down simple.7 you killed this guy's brother, he is looking for revenge and he also try's to kill you so you get this, simple movie not complicate at all. That is one thing that this movies get right constantly.The racing in this movie: I think they did a better job than in 2, because I didn't noticed more of a CGI, because that's how they just do it now, a lot of wide shot you can tell there was a lot of practical stunt drive, it look good which I enjoyed that. I know a lot of people will put this movie lover down and I think it is a solid movie and a solid flick. This is the first time Brian Tyler made the score and this is also the first one that Justin Lin directed, he went later directing three next movies 4,5 and 6 which I love to death. I thought the direction is good, I like the resolves on the end of the movie, the sound track is good, I did not mind the cast you know. Lucas Black is the lead in this movie. Sonny Chiba is in this movie I always like the actor. This was Sung Kang's first introduction of his character Han who later appeared in 4 as a cameo, than in 5 and 6 as regular cast. Vin Diesel did returned with his character Dominic Toretto, who made a cameo scene on the end of the movie, which I thought was pretty cool. Bow Wow I didn't mind him in this movie and Nathalie Kelley was extremely hot and I really though she was much better sexy babe, than Eva Mendes was in 2 Fast 2 Furious. Nathalie Kelley lights up the screen as Neela and I would welcome her return to the series any time.Overall: Tokyo Drift gets a solid 8 by me it does lacks on the great characters and the cast of the first two movies in the series, but is redeemed by Han, awesome car scenes and a pounding score from Brian Tyler. I have enjoyed this movie and I",dilipbts,2020-06-10,2020
9.0,Lived up to the purpose of its inception and then some.,"In a 2-day time span, I saw this movie and The Break-up, and I'm glad this one the vote for the one we saw first, even though I voted against it. I had lost faith in the series after 2 fast 2 furious, and was surprised that this one didn't take on the moniker 3 3rast 3 3rurious. The change of protagonist was a nice change, though the acting for his part could have been done better, and while the accent didn't get to me much, I found it rather amusing that most of the Asian actors had better enunciation than this one of the handful of Americans in the film. I went into this film expecting action, and action I received. From the first thrilling race against Zachery Ty Bryan in his daddy's Viper, to the final showdown against the very hate-able antagonist, and everything in between. I, like others, saw the first race, and thought ‘Okay, they can't POSSIBLY get any better than that!’ and was proved wrong as the protagonist comically smashed up a lent car. Speaking of smashed up cars, this had to be some of the best driving stunt work I've seen in a great long while. While a lot of the work was obviously CG, it was integrated so well that I barely noticed, and I'm working towards a B.A in Animation, so I have a better trained eye than most in noticing that sort of thing. My only major gripe was the midnight drift with the girl. It was extraneous, and, in my opinion, could have been cut. There are better ways for character development. I got something I didn't expect out of this movie as well. This elusive thing to most action flicks that we like to call ‘Plot’. While some of it was strained, I think that, considering the genre, they managed to put together a great plot. The idea was that the protagonist was an outcast automotive engineering student, who never fit in, except for racing. In his new So.Cal. Public School, complete with metal detectors, he gets into a squabble with the local football star, Zachary Ty Bryan over what all teenage boys fight over, a girl. Predictably, a race is chosen to decide this. After much destruction of property, he wins the race, but loses as his car flips, in what I think is one of the best uses of slow-mo since The Matrix. Afterwards, at the police precinct, he is in big trouble, and his mother bails him out in *ahem* unknown ways. His mother, presumably tired of moving every time her son gets into trouble (it's never said, but I believe it's a reasonable assumption), he is sent to Tokyo to live with his estranged Navy father. It is there that he gets involved in the underground world of Drifting, and proceeds to wreck up cars and get babes, and everything else. He manages to get into another fight about another girl, but this time with a guy who's Yakuza (Japanese mob for those less educated or who haven't seen this movie), or at least has Yakuza ties, and thus is more dangerous to mess with. This guy, known only as DK, becomes the source for much strife (obviously, as he's the main antagonist), eventually leading to the final race, involving my favorite car ever. I'm trying my best to leave out big spoilers here, so I won't give away the very end of it. All in all, this movie was an excellent film to see with friends. The adrenaline rush was so great through the movie, and the cars, as a side note, weren't the outrageous things from the first two. No neon under glow, and spoilers half the size of the car (maybe these tuner kids will stop blocking my view with them now), and the cars with spoilers actually needed spoilers (Honda Civics with spoilers always make me laugh). One thing to remember, though, is that it is an action movie, after all is said and done. It wasn't really created to portray a message, or do anything other than entertain. If you look too deep at this movie, you will be invariably disappointed. There's not much beyond face value to the movie, but it will be enjoyable if you take it as such.",terulian_maveric,2006-06-23,2006
10.0,Much better than 2fast,This movie was far better than 2fast 2furious. Thankfully the ditched the tired storyline of an undercover cop in this one. This time around it's about a kid that just wants to race. The plot isn't amazing but at least its fresh and not the same tired movie with new race scenes.(2fast 2furious). The movie gets off to a banging start with a race with in the first five minutes. The racing scenes in this one are the best of the series. I thought the characters in this movie were great too. While not as gritty and mean as the characters from the previous movies they do stand out well. I especially liked bow wows character. So basically if you liked the first movie or even the second then you should love this one. I don't know why some people are giving it bad reviews and scores. But If you like fast cars then this is definitely a movie for you.,bobeatsrice,2006-06-20,2006
8.0,"Interesting, highly stylized movie","I first watched this movie while waiting for a problem with an old car I had to be fixed in a big auto-repair shop. They had this client area with a flat screen where Tokyo Drift was rolling.I am not a ""fast and furious"" fan. Definitely. But...But the way this movie was shot, the camera angles and movements, the music, the scenes, the Asian actors performance - all this compelled me to watch a movie in an auto-repair shop (a first, indeed), and on top of that, a movie which had started 15 minutes earlier or so.Of course, by the time the problem with the car was fixed, I took off - I didn't get to watch it to the end.I purchased a DVD copy of Tokyo Drift some 11 months later.This is not a John Woo-imitator movie - you know, these John Woo wannabes that think buckets of blood, gun shots and lightning-fast punches and kicks is all there is to it.No, actually, for the most part this movie is...calm. Philosophical. A brief take-a-look-and-see into the Japanese drift phenomenon, with its glitter, powerful engine sounds, stylish clothing, and a almost-gaijin kind of attitude of Japanese youth.The plot is simple, with a few clichés thrown in, the kind of plot that makes one wonder why do they spend millions of dollars on a movie ""powered"" by it. BUT...BUT plot is, surprisingly, only a small element, something that brings together the characters and makes up the scenes where they breath and live.The acting is good, the soundtrack is very appropriate if not excellent.The directing is FIRST RATE. It brings all the elements together. Calmly, elegantly, honestly, and in such a way as to actually lend credibility to the characters actions and fates.The slow movements are reminiscent of the Best Anime tradition, and the dialogs (though simple), together with the soundtrack and camera angles/position, calmly rocky you into thinking about what it would be like to simply enjoy driving, drifting, through the night, alone or with someone by your side.I enjoyed it. What else can one ask of a movie?",Chronus,2009-06-15,2009

8.0,Tokyo Saves Cliché Theme,"Tokyo Saves Cliché Theme Maybe being Asian American gives me a thrill from finally seeing Asian teens laugh at the white kids and beat up the token black guy in high school.The acting is bad, the premise unbelievable, the plot predicable, the characters tokens, but some how the great city of Tokyo saves the whole picture. Much like the city of Osaka in 'Black Rain' the city isn't just the set. It's the main character.There's also plenty of action and much more focus on the racing scenes than the boring character. This is a good thing. The character simply exist because someone needs to drive the cars. (of course the ""actors"" don't actually drive the cars the stunt drivers do.) But every story needs a hero, a villain, a damsel in distress, and a token black friend.Actually this film deserves a lot of credit for picking up on the Japanese art of drag ""drift"" racing. It's been around for over 30 years in Japanese pop culture.""Drift"" racing resulted from the many winding roads in Japanese roads and involves the car gliding into a 90 degree turn rather than slowing down to turn.The plot: Poor Southern teenager Sean just gets in trouble everywhere he goes. Inevitably rich kids make fun of him which results in a drag race. But after Sean's third strike he's sent to live with his military father serving in Tokyo.Thus the old fish out of water cliché. Although this time it's funnier, since they make fun of Japanese pop culture, like not wearing shoes in school. Unfortunately there's not enough of it.Sean is sent to regular Japanese high school. Hardly believable since he doesn't even speak Japanese! And since American military families are usually provided with English schools for ""army brats."" Sean predictably makes friends with the token black guy and the hot Australian girl whose boyfriend is the Yakuza villain.Even more predictably Sean's forbidden romance puts him in the middle of rival Yakuza drift racing gangs.The most unbelievable scene is where Sean's father says, ""That's it. You're on a plane tonight."" but relents and agrees to let his son enter a dangerous illegal drift race against the Yakuza. WTF!!! As I said, don't try and take this film too seriously or you'll go mad. Just enjoy the fast and furious city of Tokyo.",chow913,2011-11-26,2011
10.0,Tokyo Drift will make you drool on yourself.,"If your a big fan of the series like I am, you got to see this movie.First off, the movie stars Lucas Black(Shawn Boswell)who gets in trouble back home and is forced to move to Toyko to live with his dad to avoid jail time.+ The sound effects are awesome, whether it's shifting gears, or hearing the rubber burn off the tires as they drift down the hill, believe me, you will hear the noise. + The music is good especially because it fits in with the whole theme. It seems to me its some kindof Japanese music which is self-explanatory. + The plot was great in my opinion is one of the best action movies of the year! If you want action, and you love the franchise, then you have to see this. You'll be surprised at the end of who shows up. + Not only do you get action, but a little comedy in there. I laughed pretty hard at some of the things Shawn would say. It seems to me that some parts of the movies were dragged out. They could have left some scenes out but overall nothing else is bad about the movie. Hope you like the movie.",ADPollock1188,2006-07-05,2006
8.0,An action flick that thrives on its unique style and cinematography,"As a loyal fan to modified cars, I very much enjoyed watching The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift and would highly recommend it. I feel that this movie successfully differentiated itself from the other two movies in the franchise to create a new ""Fast-paced"" viewing experience as well as highlight the directors style. Despite views from critics, I hold this movie in high regards for what it has, rather than what it lacks in the acting and storyline department.What I most enjoyed about this movie was its perspective, and style utilized in displaying the action. Not only did it use unique camera angles and cinematography, the techniques and devices in general were well suited to the location and essence that the movie delivers. It is set in Tokyo, where fast cars, latest fashion, and state-of-the-art gadgets are abundant. To compliment this, my favorite cinematography device was the camera shots through the mobile phones. Personally I found that worked exceptionally well, and made for some great eye candy.I pity all critics that denote this movie in terms of acting, plot etc. What they seem to understand is that this sort of movie criteria is important and must be executed. What they don't understand is that this movie criteria is unessential for this genre of movie. Any survey done on behalf of this movie will prove that viewers of this action genre, come to see action and great visuals, rather than big name actors and intellectually challenging plots.I give this movie a generous 7/10 simply because i felt the action was unique, which included never before seen cinematography. Critics can say what they may about the acting, or the storyline, yet it is important to realize that this criteria was executed adequately, and that the movie was successful in delivering a great viewing experience.",EdwinTetlow141,2006-07-07,2006
10.0,Underrated Movie Gem (11/10),"I really cannot state enough how much overhated this movie was back in the day and actually still is, one reason being that (Tokyo Drift) actually is The Fast & Furious film to follow the street racing format the most, while it also is one of the most realistic F&F films and it also have some of the best, most intense and most believable acting in the whole franchise, Though these reasons a not actually the reasons that I really believe that this movie doesn't get the love it deserves. No, what I really believe makes Tokyo Drift stand out is that how perfect the cast is and how nearly every actor in Tokyo Drift compliments each other in so many ways and gives it so much more believability, and really just makes it the best action movie having the aspect of cars, love and friendship being put so perfectly together giving you A Racing film which fits Don Torreto's way of thinking way better than the mainline F&F movies about what family is and how we as humans have to stand together with those who have helped us through life!!",RealCJHopkins,2024-11-02,2024
9.0,Definite Improvement Over the First Two Films,"Being an automotive enthusiast, (and a movie buff) for over 10 years now, I've always been one of the first in line to see the F and F movies when they came out. This movie was no exception. However, after being disappointed with the first two films, I didn't expect much from this third installment. The first two films satisfied my need for hot cars, women, and so-so action scenes, but I felt that the acting, dialog, and story lines were very thin and boring. F and F Tokyo Drift was much better than I had anticipated. It seems that the director (Justin Lin) actually concentrated more on the acting skill of the actors and dramatic aspects of the film, than he did on showing off the cars. That's where the first two installments fell short. It was also great to see the drift culture in this film, in addition to the show and drag-race culture that we were exposed to in the first two films. I've never been to Japan, but from what I have experienced in the U.S., I felt that the film did a pretty good job of depicting the key elements of the drift culture to the audience. Of course there were a few of the usual over-the-top stunts and scenes, but it's to be expected in a Hollywood picture. If it were exactly true to life, it would just be a documentary. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised and entertained, and I think that if you even somewhat enjoyed the first two, you will definitely love F and F Tokyo Drift. Even if you're not into cars and/or the whole tuner culture, the movie is still entertaining and a fun ride.",dchampagne-2,2006-06-21,2006
8.0,Does what you expect,"Alright, let's get this out of the way: if you have no interest in cars, don't bother. If you want moving, powerful acting performances, look elsewhere. If blow-off valves and spinning tires make your heart shift into high gear, this is your kind of movie. The story is wafer-thin, it serves only as a hasty explanation to bring the audience to the Tokyo location and set up some action addicted races. The acting is just decent enough to keep you from groaning constantly, though Sung Kang's role as Han stands out as memorable and pleasant. Lucas Black has an understated quality about him that I think allows the movie's merit of its stunt sequences to shine, rather than the lead trying to steal all the attention. Which leaves me with the car play--the writers thankfully stopped trying to be technical and accurate in terms or facts (for the most part), so there's no ""...Blow the welds on your intake..."" crap, which is just plain wrong. The stunt drivers delivered lots of jaw-dropping drifts and high octane chases, and Justin Lin and his second-unit director took great care in highlighting the automotive lunacy. The cars and the setting are all glossy and colorful, and there is a wide range of makes and models to drool over, all just a bit over the top in their appearance. The music matches the speed of the movie as well, getting the target audience fired up with rock, hip-hop, and electronic tracks in all the right spots. Simply put, this movie offers what it promises, and gets by on the rest. I'm one of those types who can look past the shortcomings for the vehicular excitement, so I loved it, despite the flaws.",carlsob,2006-06-19,2006
8.0,A Different Concept for Fast and Furious Series,"Tokyo Drift is a movie that brought a different concept to the Fast and the Furious Series. Previous films had ten-second speed races on the straight track. In Tokyo drift, races are not like that, the main thing is not to be fast, but to finish the race by doing good drifting on sweeping roads.It offers a different style to the audience as cars. We got used to classic American cars from previous movies. The audience also had the opportunity to watch Asian cars in this movie. There are plenty of racing scenes in the movie. It saturates the audience with races and action.The film generally focuses on Han. In the 6th film of the series, he talks about his life in Tokyo after Han decided to return to Tokyo.My favorite scene in the movie is the scene between Han and Sean on a balcony. There is a message about life here. I like that it contains messages about life in movies. The surprise at the end of the movie was nice, but I wish they didn't finish the race without showing who won.Having erotic scenes in the movie was not good in terms of the movie. I especially learned from the sex scene of two girls. I have never admitted having obscene scenes in movies.",drmuhammedsamiduru,2020-04-22,2020

8.0,The Best Thus Far,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift took me by complete surprise. The movie completely redeemed the series following the Too Fast, Too Furious fiasco. Although the movie does not contain the appealing American muscle cars of the first title, the eloquent interpretation of drifting as a racing style (art form)and the culmination of turbo charged 350 Z's and RX7's,lets the picture differ from the typical concept of headstrong American drag racing. Decent acting and an even better storyline, allows the viewer to embrace the techniques in Japanese underground racing. Plus, Vin Diesel's cameo is ridiculously bad ass.",irishprd88,2006-06-19,2006
10.0,Tokyo drift,"Love this movie , this is the one actually about the cars and car racing and not drugs, guns and whatever else , where you are not sure if your watching the war or what. It is good to see new faces , seeing all the same ones except Paul's while he was still here is annoying and boring, especially one of vin diesel. I thought actors were pretty good, at least main ones were really into their role , DK didn't even have to say anything he looked mean enough. Han he was sort of cool guy just sitting in background, and Sean was really into his role of learning how to drift. Neela is really pretty, prettier than other girls from the series. Loved that it actually touched on reality of car drifting and portrayed real drift king.",jovanar-75708,2020-08-06,2020
9.0,Was much better than 2Fast 2Furious but with small flaws...,"I thought that the movie was awesome. However, there were some minor set backs which made me think ""now that is stupid"". To start off, I thought that Bow Wow should not have been in the movie, but he did do a good job. I just think it is stupid that they had to get someone famous like that for that part... Another thing...Shawn Boswell was a great actor but his country southern accent seemed too fake. It seemed like he was 'trying to hard' if you know what I mean. Last thing for now...Vin Diesel's appearance was not needed. It was just really stupid how he just showed up for 10 seconds! Anyways, to make a review short, it is a great movie and you should see it if you liked (or didn't!) the first or second Fast and Furious.",FlyersPh9,2006-06-18,2006
10.0,"a nice change for the franchise, something different",I was a big fan of the franchise before this came out and I thought I was going to hate it but it actually turned out to be pretty good and lived up to the hype of other Fast And Furious films. I really liked the concept of drifting in this one and the fact that it takes place in Tokyo is pretty interesting. This version has all new characters so you won't be seeing Brian or any of the old cast until the next film. What is pretty cool about this is that they made fast and the furious 4 a prequel to tokyo drift so really number 4 is taking place before tokyo drift in the story. It ties into place with one or two characters for the next film. Plenty of sexy Japanese cars and hot girls in this film so of course that never changes. Out of all of them this is one of my favourites.,miketaylor2007,2010-05-06,2010
8.0,"I was not supposed to like this movie, but...","Despite being the wrong demographic for this movie (over 25) I **loved** it. Nice job, Justin Lin. Imagine if MTV's ""Pimp My Ride"" and Sofia Coppola's ""Lost In Translation"" had a baby but they gave it up for adoption and it was brought up by Ridley Scott's ""Black Rain"" - well, that baby would grow up to be ""The F&TF Tokyo Drift"". It seems that I need to write ten lines of text to meet the submission guidelines for these reviews, but I've already said what I want to say about the movie. What ever happened to encouraging conciseness? OK then, here is a random haiku: In my dark kitchen / My laptop screen glows bright white / On TV, World Cup",ericfraser_sf,2006-06-22,2006
10.0,Correcting the above person and some things i thought about the movie,"There weren't any HUGE glaring inaccuracies (other than daddy throwing sonny the keys to a car with NO ENGINE in it...) < WHAT YOU SAID IS INCORRECT. The Car he received from his dad had no engine, But he had put another car's engine into the car. It was shown in the movie. The movie was pretty good. I do like cars and if you like cars also you should see the movie. The action was good all around which made it a good movie. Drifing is pretty cool and if you would like to see how drifting is you should also see the movie. I give this movie a 10 because it shows how drifting is.",BksNinja,2006-06-19,2006
9.0,A different world,"""Fast & Furious 3: Tokyo Drift"", the third installment in the franchise, shines brightly with its unique approach to the series. The film takes a daring leap by shifting its setting to Tokyo and introducing a new protagonist, Sean Boswell, portrayed by Lucas Black. This change of pace infuses the series with a fresh burst of energy, showcasing the fusion of American car culture with Japanese drifting techniques.The movie's greatest strength lies in its breathtaking racing sequences. The art of drifting takes center stage, transforming car chases into mesmerizing dances of controlled chaos. Director Justin Lin's keen eye for dynamic camerawork captures the essence of these moments, allowing viewers to feel the adrenaline rush as they immerse themselves in the high-speed world of Tokyo street racing.Tokyo itself becomes a character, with its neon-lit streets and pulsating nightlife forming a vivid backdrop for the story. The film's ability to transport audiences to a completely different culture while maintaining the essence of the series is commendable. The music, a mix of hip-hop and electronic beats, complements the fast-paced visuals perfectly, elevating the overall experience.However, amidst these positives, some aspects falter. The absence of series regulars like Vin Diesel and Paul Walker is noticeable and their absence creates a void that even Tokyo's vibrant energy struggles to fill. Lucas Black's portrayal of Sean lacks the charisma and depth of his predecessors, which sometimes makes it difficult to fully invest in his journey.In conclusion, ""Fast & Furious 3: Tokyo Drift"" stands as a bold departure from the franchise's formula, exploring new territories and introducing viewers to a different facet of the car culture. Its stunning racing scenes, immersive setting, and eclectic soundtrack make it a standout entry. Yet, the absence of familiar faces and a slightly weaker lead performance are notable drawbacks. Despite these minor shortcomings, the film successfully rejuvenates the series and remains a memorable chapter for fans and newcomers alike.",uhudsavascisi,2023-08-18,2023
8.0,The best of the 3,"In FNF Tokyo Drift we get to follow the young kid Sean (Lucas Black) who always seem to get into trouble. A typical new-age teenager who think that the entire world centers on him. Crashing his car in a illegal street race he soon discovers it does not. The choice? Go live with your father in Japan or go to jail in the U.S. Sean reluctivly choose the first option and soon discovers how it is to be a foreigner in a new country nothing like what he is used to. But the troublesome kid inside him takes over and soon he is tangled up in illegal street racing, guys that don't like him for being a gaijin (foreigner), he gets to cross the local Yakuza boss' nephew and to make everything straight again, he needs to learn how to drift..FNF Tokyo Drift is by far the best of the 3. Where the first one gets a lot of respect for doing a movie on the subject of illegal street racing, the second in the series was a major drop. Bad acting, bad plot, bad computer generated visual effects and the list can continue. No-one expected very much from the third movie. No really known actors no block buster names. Maybe that is the reason for this being the best movie of the 3. Or maybe it is just the awesome drifting stunts being performed that will keep you sitting on the edge of your seat throughout the movie.The most interesting thing is that this movie has a buildup just like a old Kung-Fu movie. The unknown hero enters a city, gets in a brawl and crosses the local bad guy. His goons beat him up and through him out to die. The young hero finds a monk that show him the mysterious drifting dragon kick (or some other crappy trick) and our hero returns and beat the crap out of the bad guy. Its fun to see how this simple form of tale-telling still works very good on film.FNF Tokyo Drift with a brand new cast does the work, and you are most certainly entertained.",r_uldal,2006-08-31,2006
8.0,I expected at worse but it is nice movie of the franchise,"After have watched the two movies of the franchise I expected a new character very bad and not interesting and a story very bad about it, well not I was completely I was hooked all the way through because the story is very nice and all of cast for the nice part or the bad guys was great they came out on top !!The two protagonist miss at the franchise okay but for this movie without them with new character it was very nice the movie stay anyway still interesting and entertaining is that we expected us as an audience !This third movie is the most stand out of the two prequels maked before, and that important cause the secondary movie was annoying this one, this third not at all !The script and directing is very nice.",tomlaju,2024-04-21,2024
8.0,Top Film,"According to the plot, a young guy who loves cars and everything related to them cannot find himself and a place where he could be understood. Subsequently, life forces him to move to Japan, where he has the opportunity to start a new life. As a result, he makes new acquaintances, finds company to his liking and begins to understand that he is where he should be...I really liked that this film includes many genres and at the same time, everything looks harmonious. The film is also instructive. One of the heroes, who is a mafioso in the film, said one phrase that I adhere to in life (and I advise you): ‘Because of a nail that was not hammered, a horseshoe fell off, a horse died because of a horse that died, a soldier did not deliver a report, because of an undelivered report, the war was lost.’ In general, the film was very cool and it is interesting to watch it all the time. I don't regret a bit that I once watched it, and now I can review and enjoy the masterpiece.",leonspikov,2022-01-19,2022

8.0,Honestly...,"I'm not a gear-head and definitely not big into car movies. I liked the first FF, but I hated the second. As for Tokyo Drift... I loved it. I rarely rate a movie a 10, usually because I'm very judgmental about small flaws, and this one actually had some huge flaws. Something about this movie just worked, though. It was like when you really like certain things and get familiar with them BECAUSE of the flaws. For one thing, I think that the main guy, as well as the jock in the beginning, looked nowhere near their supposed ages, because the actors really weren't, but I think that they did a good job. I think they should have changed it to college, though, because that would have just been more believable. The acting in some roles wasn't great, but those were all small acting roles, no main characters. I loved the characters in this, especially Han. The story was also good, mostly because it was kept simple and executed very smoothly. However... there is a part roughly 70 minutes in that... I can't watch easily. Every time it gets to that point I consider rewinding it. If you've seen the movie you know what part I mean, if you haven't you'll figure it out when you see that part. Overall this movie just worked for me. Don't watch it expecting a masterful piece of art or any deep, symbolic meanings, there really aren't any. It's just a genuinely entertaining movie, and that's why it got a 10.",slayer_of_the_jugga_phuk,2007-04-30,2007
8.0,Lucas blacks best performance!!!!!,This movie is wild funny and has fast drifting cars!!! This movie is one of the best fast and the furious since the original!! This movie starts out with a race!! Lucas Black gets in trouble and has to be sent off to his dad in Tokyo!! He then makes friends with bow wow!! And then that nite try's to drift with Hans car the Mona Lisa!!! He wrecks it and then gets tangled with the mafia!! He falls in love with DKs girlfriend which gets him a lot of beatings in the film it's kinda a mess by the end but hey this one is my fav f and f movie!!!!,bethlori,2021-04-22,2021
8.0,It was better than the second one but not as good as the first,OK this is for the comment above about the navy brat ! For a start neither of them was a navy brat. Shaun was sent to Tokyo to avoid going to jail back in the states. I agree that the plot was rather terrible but apart from that it was good. Japs invented drifting so i think you are wrong mate. The only thing that was wrong with this film was that it didn't have a wide enough range of cars that it could of done like the previous ones. All you saw was 350 z and a skyline now and then. Don't get me wrong the s15 (which was actually a s13 that had been converted) was rather nice but a bit pathetic when he opened the hood and you saw the s13 engine ha ha. The Evo was rather nice and the Rx7. What was with Bow Wows car man. WTF Wat that ha ha. Rite mess. But overall worth watching. I personally think they could have done a better job or maybe even relate it to the previous ones. But no they had to do this. Ah well was disappointed but like I've said definitely worth watching.,zoe_loves_richard,2006-06-20,2006
10.0,Beautiful Film,"At first, I wasn't sure how Justin Lin could pull off the whole drifting scene and make a story out of it. I went in with high hopes and left even happier. Lucas Black has another great performance in another great film. He has a bright future ahead of him. Every racing sequence in this film is amazingly done and is all real. In the first two films, you could notice that the racing sequences were all done on a computer. Here, you can tell it's really happening. I highly recommend that the car lovers should go see this film. Especially if you love drifting. I'm a fan of all types of racing and I loved this film. I know I'll be making another trip back to see it. Also, the first racing sequence is AMAZING. It's pretty accurate to how a race could start. I give this film, a 9 out of 10.",fenderbass2122,2006-06-17,2006
10.0,What an adrenaline rush!,"OK, well it wasn't an Oscar winning kind of movie, nor was it meant to be, but it is an amazing thrill ride that doesn't slow down. Before i went to this movie on the opening weekend, i had read some bad reviews of it and so i went in with mixed thoughts. But i came out with a clear thought in my mind, WHAT A FILM!It is so well directed and the actors are perfect in each role and the cars, wow! (but that mustang at the end would have never drifted like that)Don't listen to all the a******s who keep moaning about it being to unrealistic. Just go in for a good fun 2 hours that really gets your blood rushing! If you liked the two previous movies then you will love this one. I am a huge car and fast and the furious fan, and i really enjoyed this one and it is by far the best in the series (you may not like Lucas Blacks accent in it, but you may get used to it).",Tom-AVA,2006-07-04,2006
9.0,Tokoyo!!!!!!!!!!,"Okay I have avoided this film for so long.Today I finally decided I was going to watch it so I sat watching this and I was so surprised to see the lead actor who I had previously watched on a TV movie called Flash.Lucas Black straight away caught my attention I never noticed him on the adverts or posters but I was captured the moment he hit the screen.This film is a high octane fuelled bomb the characters I felt were more deeper in this movie then the previous movies I have to say 2 was terrible but the third instalment definitely captures what the first started.Hot girls, Hot girls and Hot girls and high performance cars.The only thing I found a bit ridiculous was how the main character Sean was attracted to the girl who was already with someone, he was surrounded by beautiful women on every corner and yet he chose the one that was already taken.Vin Diseal's appearance was also a perfect finishing touch and I thought this film possibly could be better then the first.",Angelus2,2007-05-31,2007
9.0,Great Film...Best out of the Three!,"I watched the first two movies before watching this one and i thought ‘no way is this gonna surpass the first film…’ o man how wrong i was! opening credits...as soon as the film started, it was great, it introduced a young (not cop) character and showed him in his daily life. the first race! omg, best first race out of all the films, 1. raced for a girl and didn't get her which was funny and 2. the race was intense and put you straight into it. moving to Tokyo was great, seeing the customs and changes he had 2 endure then the whole movie took off. the characters all developed well with the story, and i actually felt bad when Han died. the cars were all as usual, great! especially the HULK mobile! lol the final race was off the scale and D.K getting owned by his uncle made everything better! overall.....AWESOME! best out of the three without a doubt, all we have to hope for now is a 4th film with the main 4 guys teaming up or something...lets hope!",nathanhannah_rulez,2006-07-06,2006
8.0,"As A Genre Film, This Is How You're Supposed To Do It","Chicks, cash and cars. Lots of cars. Lots and lots of cars. That about sums up this film. If you're a car fanatic be it a drag racing fan from Texas or a West Coast drifter this film is for you. Plenty of automotive eye candy for everyone and Justin Lin really worked the camera to give the audience what they came for... some women, some money and a whole lot of cars. If you despise anything with 4 wheels then stay away from this film, otherwise this movie really is nothing more than an automotive nut's dream. I won't even talk about the paper thin plot or the B grade acting. The cameos were a nice touch and a slick little nod to fans of the drifting scene as well as folks who saw the first film in the series. All in all this is a pretty short review but it should be for a film that doesn't try to make things more complicated than they have to be. Kudos should be given to Brian Tyler for his pumping musical score and again to Justin Lin for his smooth work from the directors chair. If the first film in the series had been this simple and straightforward it probably wouldn't have gotten as bad a rap as it did. Tokyo Drift is the best installment of the series IMO because it doesn't try to be something it's not. A simple movie for simple car guys. 5/10 on any normal day of the week but I bump that up to a 7/10 because I'm such a huge car fanatic and the 1970 GTX at the end of the film had me salivating.",bruddah_man_matt,2006-08-02,2006

9.0,Better than the others,"I have to say, the movie was definitely better than the trailer. That's a rarity nowadays. This movie had action from start to finish. I couldn't and didn't even get up to use the restroom!! The movie had gorgeous guys, beautiful girls and off the hook music. That's the way it is with racing in the real world. The plot was realistic. It had enough to keep the movie goer watching. The cars were off...the...hook...!! And last but definitely not least...the end of the movie..the best part of the whole movie. When they tell Sean he has someone who wants to race him and they show that car with the sound system blasting the best Don Omar song in the streets right now...crazy!!!! And the driver? Man please, this flick was off da meter....",marisela537,2006-06-20,2006
8.0,Best movie of the series,Tokyo drift was something different from the other movies of the series. Having a relatively unknown star-cast devoid of any superstars actually worked in favor of this movie. There was not much technology used here for planning a robbery or saving the world like the others. This movie gave a good introduction about drift racing especially on mountains like it has been shown in various video games as well. I would highly recommend this movie for a car racing as well as racing video games fans.,hemil_3000,2020-02-04,2020
10.0,"Opening Boring, But Rest Awesome","I saw this movie in theaters recently and I highly recommend it. Though the opening makes the movie seem cheesy and boring (it doesn't open with a race as usual, but instead with high school kids walking through a metal detector), after the beginning, it is awesome. I would recommend watching it in a theater with friends, and maybe even buying it when it comes out on DVD. It is definitely worth the money, delivering the same levels of excitement as the first two movies. All the actors are new to this series, but they are excellent actors (and pretty darn cute!). Japanese culture is presented very well, with the girls wearing the latest trends, using the latest Japanese music, and even accurately representing small things, such as school dress codes. The surprise cameo at the end (not telling who!) makes the movie all he more interesting and leaves you wanting to see more.",peacebe_dajourney,2006-06-21,2006
8.0,Surprised,"I wandered into the theater to see Tokyo Drift as a time killer. Being a lover of all things Asian, I wasn't expecting much, but to my surprise, I really enjoyed the film. I had seen the original Fast and the Furious and found it passable entertainment and really didn't expect much from a second sequel, but this film really has heart, perhaps due to the many female production people listed in the credits.Lucas Black is Sean Boswell,a teen-aged racing fanatic who finds himself banished to the care of his father in Tokyo, Japan when his luck runs out with the law at home. Trying to fit into an alien culture, Sean finds himself falling into the illegal racing culture. A bad race lands him in servitude to a top racer who becomes a mentor. With a new girlfriend things are going well for Sean except that Han, his mentor is partners with a low level Yakuza underling who holds sway over his girlfriend Neela. Betrayal leads to murder and revenge culminating in a final nighttime race down a mountainside.While not a great script, the story held my attention throughout. Indeed, some of the Japanese school scenes suggest interesting possibilities for an entirely separate film. This is not a film about acting, but Lucas Black holds his own against the lovingly photographed cars. The other local performers all did well and as usual the Asian with blond hair is always a bad guy and why couldn't a Japanese actress be found to play the love interest?",Mark-129,2006-06-22,2006
10.0,already a classic,"The underdog story, the fact lucas black plays sean boswell as a outsider who loves cars but dont belongs anywhere but try to be part of tokyo, and how sung kang becomes his mentor.this movie is a classic, not only han becomes one of the coolest guys in the furious universe, sean boswell here is the underdog we all know that loves cars but needs to learn more about life , and the movie is the best you can expect. Not only is at some point nearly philosophical, also is about a gang of outsiders that found themselves being the important people at the end.",Cinema2kMendoza,2021-09-20,2021
9.0,Overall Tokyo Drift Was Another Banger For Me!,"Tokyo Drift is bringing back the more serious theme in the franchise after the pretty much light hearted 2 Fast 2 Furious, Lucas Black as the Paul Walker in this one, and Sung Kang as the Vin Diesel in this one, Sean and Han was basically the friendly bond version of Brian and Dom, Brian Tee as D. K. is a very convincing bad guy, he was great, and just like the previous movie, Tokyo Drift also fills with great badass exciting loud action sequence, great music, and the story in this one is so far the purest race car story in the franchise, added with a strong friendship elements in it, overall Tokyo Drift was another banger for me!",HabibieHakim123,2023-03-17,2023
9.0,"Yes, it was Fast and Yes, it was furious","Lets be honest here, if you arrive at the cinema expecting an intelligent meaningful storyline you will be sorely disappointed. Tokyo Drift was produced for those among us who are car fanatics or adrenaline junkies. This sequel has thrown the most impressively modified cars to date and it has not disappointed its loyal fans. I was impressed to see the mistakes from the 2nd sequel have not been repeated. For the most part, the driving stunts were actually done by the professional drifting team from Japan, not so much computer generated junk. For those of us who were eagerly awaiting the next level of customized cars, the 350Z and the RX-7 lived up to expectations. The only aspect of the film that bothered me was the southern accent of the American. It was just too blatant...So for those who needed to see a film surrounding some incredible driving techniques it was a masterpiece! If however you were seeking to be enlightened by the storyline you should have stayed in the parking lot.",demon-drifter,2007-02-09,2007
10.0,And we live in To-Ki-Yo,"Great movie, I actually liked it the best out of the three films. Really animated jokes, great stunts, and one of the things I liked best is how true they kept the Japanese element, with the high school and other cultural differences.The ten second appearance of Vin Diesal only made it that much better, and honestly, The movie pulled me into it's world so much that I wanted nothing more then to go try my hand at drifting :) and hopefully not die from the experience.Another delight was the fact that Bow Wow is actually an Actor! Something that with everyone in Hollywood trying every job I as very Skeptical of, and yet he did it amazingly, Great Job all around to the cast!",EchosSorrow04,2006-07-06,2006
9.0,Wonderful!,"Awesome movie, I saw it the night it came out in theaters here in Italy, and found it so good I simply had to go see it again the next day. Way better than the second, both from the storyline point of view than from the racing point of view. Drifting is something awesome, and they managed to show the thrill of doing it in this movie, so, really, I'm enthusiast of it. Can't wait for the DVD to come out, this is a must to see! Another thing I loved of the movie are the cars used, mostly from Japan, but hey, there's a reason for that, Japan cars are the best for drifting, after all it was invented there...Again, maybe I repeat myself but the storyline is really really good, and the actors do their job really well, I was a bit skeptical knowing the original cast wouldn't be there, but the only one I found a bit out of place was the guy playing D.K., not frightening like the nephew of a Yakuza should be, I could tell from the moment I saw him that the character was just a buffoon, while in the beginning it should have been more frightening.",hhrshipper,2006-07-15,2006
9.0,Tokyo drift,this film was a bit like fast and furious 1 because on number 1 Paul walker owed Vin Diesel a car and on Tokyo drift Shaun owed Han a car. but Tokyo drift was a wicked film best 1 so far there was some nice cars on it and the best bit was when Han and Shaun where getting chased by D.K and one of the funniest parts was at the beginning when Shaun was in the police station watching the CCTV of the race and he done the jump and he asked for a copy that was funny as f**k. but all in all it was a good film. twinkles car was really smart and it was weird because the wheels on Shauns red Mitsubishi evolution VIII are the same wheels as what my friend has on his car. it made me laugh when the fisherman was sitting there saying Shaun cant drift it was a little funny.,grantjf15,2007-01-25,2007
8.0,Best of the Series. Fight Me.,"This movie is crazy fun. Justin Lin is a perfect fit for this franchise, and the way he shoots the drifting scenes gives us maybe the best-looking car action in the whole franchise. Best of all, it gives us the coolest character in the franchise: Han. He single-handedly expands the way the series treats the role of the ""alpha male"", something if Hobbs and Shaw is much too insecure and stupid to tackle or understand.",matthewssilverhammer,2019-11-05,2019
9.0,Drop your preconceptions and judge this movie on its own merits,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I have seen the other two in the franchise, and I thought the second one sucked. I had better hopes for this one simply based on the location in Tokyo, which I think is the most fascinating city in the world. I wanted to watch the movie just to see images of the city. If the movie happened to be decent, well then that would just be a bonus. Boy was I pleasantly surprised at how good this film was! This movie is pure entertainment. The cinematography is gorgeous, and really reveals Tokyo as a futuristic city. The racing scenes are amazing. The character development is there, and you actually are intrigued by the main characters. There is plenty of eye candy to go around. I was gripped the whole time by this movie. Even if you didn't like the other F&F movies, I think you should give this one a chance. It definitely has more depth to it than the others.",bthuynh,2006-06-19,2006
10.0,On par with the original f&f,"before you go see this movie, some things you should know beforehand: if you are not into cars, exotic women, drifting, and male Asian actors that are clueless about kung-fu, then this movie may not be for you, much like only baseball fans would really wanna see a movie about baseball.with that being stated, this movie is on par with the first f&f movie. expect to see the similar storyline, acting, inside jokes (if you're into drifting), and of course, lots of modified cars and exotic women. this movie is a fun-filled roller coaster ride, and although it's not of a really high caliber, the movie is never boring. director lin was probably the most suitable for creating the third f&f movie because the movie clearly portrays that Asian American actors are more than just kung-fu fighters, and that is refreshing. movies like this should hopefully gear towards representing Asian American actors as color-blind main characters of mainstream movies in the near future. sung kang was not only awesome to watch, but his character was a breakthrough in a typical role given to Asian American actors in the history of acting, for i do not remember the last time there ever was a native English speaking male Asian American actor playing a major role (pardon my long description) in a movie who doesn't do martial arts.if you are comfortable with movies about cars, women, and lots of action, definitely go see this movie. if not, then this movie probably is not for you.",jermko06,2006-07-15,2006
8.0,Awesome Franchise Showing off JDM Style,"I have been watching the franchise since the beginning and besides the stunts getting crazier it is still well worth the movie ticket, popcorn and Coke.This movie is No exception and the cars are amazing. Love the JDM cars and this delivers over and over.Awesome movie.",Kelford-Cams,2022-04-04,2022
9.0,"trashy, terrible acting, and gratuitous t and a. sign me up.","writing a meaningful review of this movie is akin to searching for a deeper, philosophical message in a Jenna Jameson movie. IE, you can't because both movies are porn, ie one is real porn and the other is car porn. And thats what made this installment of Fast and the Furious absolutely worth my time. Acting, deplorable, writing terrible, main character's accent, corny (i thought he was making it up the entire time but he is from alabama and talks like that in the out takes also). what did this movie offer, sweet street scenes from japan, hot girls in ridiculous outfit, and over the top driving stunts on par with MI 2 and the Bourne Supremacy. Yeah there was a lot of green screen CGI stuff also but enough real driving to make the movie worthwhile. so in a nut shell, if you are under 40, like video games, anime culture, or were a fan of the dukes of hazard TV show, you will probably like this movie too. turn you brain off for a hour and a half and enjoy.",pdxtex,2006-10-05,2006
10.0,what this film should be judged on,This is first and foremost an action film you do not watch it for the characters and story you watch it for the action and for the thrills and in this aspect the fast and furious tokyo drift definitely delivers. The action scenes have a real sense of speed. They also give you a real sense of danger and you never know what is coming next.It also contains some very nice cars i am not really into the Japanese tuning seen but this film contains every kind of car from nissans to mustangs to volkswagens there really is something for everyone!In conclusion if you want a film with in depth story and characters look elsewhere but if you want a good thrilling action movie then the fast and the furious tokyo drift is certainly worth watching.,gavin_2003,2006-06-19,2006
9.0,So much better than the last two.,"Finally, a F&F where cops are not involved. As a girl I'm tired of seeing car movies where they are always running from the cops. Another added feature, you didn't have to look at the monotone expression of Paul Walker for two hours. Lucas Black is a good addition to the movie as well as the Japanese setting. Han was a great character and they picked an excellent actor. This is something to note about the movie, each actor has a very definitive voice. This makes it much more verbally entertaining. While movies like these usually contain a lot of ""fromage"", the only really corny parts are in the very beginning with the blond girl and the guy from home improvement. Otherwise very entertaining and looking forward to a fourth.",jcemoney,2006-07-16,2006
10.0,I love it,"It's able to balance the great direction of the last 2 films with some lighthearted humor, and the lead is one of the best in the franchise, he guides you along his journey from the start to the very end.",asherrbh_15,2021-05-06,2021
8.0,Stylish and exciting,"I was pleasantly surprised when i saw ""fast and the furious"" today. After a lackluster effort in the second movie, a new energy was injected into the series with ""Tokyo Drift"" I found that in ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" the people involved in creating the movie were scared of smashing up the cars too much. In races people would not bump into other cars, but would rather sit behind them trying to be menacing. The action also seemed to occur off the racecourse, instead of on, which is more characteristic of car movies.But enough of ""2 Fast 2 Furious"". On to ""Tokyo Drift"". This movie has just nothing to the previous movies in the series apart from racing and a cameo at the end of the movie. Many people will know that no characters from the last movie have been carried over into ""Tokyo Drift"". Instead of having a cop, the new main character is from the other side of the tracks and very early in the film it is established that he has a history of reckless driving.Don't expect too much from the storyline, it's very linear. There aren't any real big shocks. But this simplicity isn't important. What hooks you in is the style it is done with. The races are all exciting, even when you know who will win - as is the case with a race early in the film. Of course, as this film is all about drifting, there is an added danger. Car damage is dealt out constantly. There isn't many car scenes where all the cars come out clean. This is where ""Tokyo Drift"" excels - dirty and uncompromising racing. Whenever there is the chance cars clash, either to spin out the opponent, or knock them into a wall or even off a cliff.I recommend that people take a couple hours out of their day to sit back, relax and enjoy ""Tokyo Drift""",this_is_gibbo,2006-06-22,2006
8.0,Breath-taking movie...,"This is my first review of a movie, so hopefully it won't be too bad...First of all I'd like to address the positives of the movie. Anyone who loves cars will definitely love this movie, but that doesn't stop the non-car fanatics enjoy the movie as well. Myself being the latter, thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The cars were spectacular and I was in awe at how they all looked, especially Twinkie's Hulkmobile! The stunt-people did an amazing job and the same with the production crew. All the aesthetics were amazing and left me with what I can only describe as a feeling of awe. The storyline was the only thing that disappointed me, but it didn't detract from the overall feeling of the movie too much, the story wasn't what this movie was about, it was about fast cars, plain and simple. I think that if there was more of a story it would have started to draw attention away from the cars, which I reinforce, was the main appeal of the movie. All of the actors and actresses also did a fine job, when times got tough you could feel it, when times got awkward you could feel it, when times got sad... you could feel it. Everything else about the movie was spectacular, and is definitely one that I will watch over and over again in weeks to come.",rossfrazer,2010-05-15,2010
