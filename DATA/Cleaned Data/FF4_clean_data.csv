0,7.0,"Still fast, still furious","Fast and Furious, or 4 Fast 4 Furious if you're keeping count, is a movie you can basically sum up in one sentence. Muscle guys, muscle cars, hot chicks, and incredible action sequences. Not much has changed in the four films other than who the muscle guys wind up being played by but nonetheless, if you're going to the movies strictly to continually watch these things, then not only will this series run forever, but you should have no problem sitting through this fourth flick. Of course the other thing to look at here is the resurrection of Vin Diesel's action star persona, and considering he's been doing movies like ‘Babylon AD’ and ‘The Pacifier’ for the past couple years, you can basically say this is one of his better performances in a real long time. The plot is pretty thin but I'm sure for fans of the first movie it will be nice to see the two leads back playing their roles. Diesel reprises wanted felon Dom Toretto, who after escaping at the end of the first movie seems to have started a new life in the Dominican Republic knocking over trucks. What brings him back to Los Angeles is revenge for the death of his girlfriend (Michelle Rodriguez) at the hands of brutal drug dealers led by Braga. This brings him face to face with the man who infiltrated his gang in the first flick, Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), now an FBI agent going after the same drug dealers. And wouldn't you know that driving plays a big part in Braga's whole smuggling operation so both Brian and Dom team up, amidst some trust issues, to bring down the drug cartel. Hopefully director Justin Lin (‘Tokyo Drift’) gets the credit he deserves this time around. He's fantastic with these action sequences, not only making them pulse-pounding thrill rides but also letting you feel like you're in the car with these characters. The movie starts out brilliantly with a propane truck hi-jacking that turns life or death when things get out of control and the truck barrels down on the hi-jackers, and then just continues to go full throttle, staging a race on a crowded Los Angeles street and then chases in an underground tunnel shaft. Once these characters get in their cars you won't be bored for a moment. Outside the car is a different matter though. Both actors do what they can. Diesel is adrenaline personified. With his gravelly voice, bulging biceps, and cool, playful way around a line of dialogue, he's a lot of fun to watch. And while still pretty wooden, I admit that Walker has a pretty-boy face and an athletic physicality that makes him a good hero. This pairing worked well in the first movie, sort of like an amateur, yet entertaining, version of the adrenaline-seeking- cop and criminal formula a la ‘Point Break.’ Just after four movies it's all gotten stale and it's easy to see that the cars are the real stars here. The Dom-Brian conflict and Dom's vendetta against the cartel is mostly overshadowed and there isn't much for either character to do when away from their vehicles. Diesel and Walker try but they always seem to be a couple wheels short of competing with the four-wheel drive. ‘Fast and Furious’ deserves credit for doing the key things well. If your expecting much from anything other than the cars then it's a disappointment, but thanks to Justin Lin this has all the makings of a really thrilling action movie, making this fourth flick in the series a little bit better than its predecessors and a lot of fun.",C-Younkin,2009-03-30,2009
1,4.0,First Five Minutes. Over,"Definitely, good for car-fans. Since I'm not one of them, I tried to view it as objectively as I could.The first five minutes rock indeed - a masterwork of ""road-action"". But, once we get over them, and the REAL ACTION begins, all goes constantly down, to ultimately fall sort of flat. The main failure remains what was purported to me, in the movie-writing terminology, the ""main event"": the demented car race trough the Los Angeles traffic - much below what it should have been! Between the chases and other hot-wheels scenes, the story-line is uselessly complicated, and the directing, correct and nothing more. Points again for he stylish animation of the final credits. And this should be all. Sadly inferior to ""Death Race"", for instance, which DID KNOW how to deliver to motor-fans!",Mihnea_aka_Pitbull,2009-04-01,2009
2,4.0,In automatic transmission,"Exhausted and pretty much running on synthetic artistry, ""Fast & Furious"" not only drops its definite article from the title but also much of the natural car chase sequences and canny blithe in place of heavily computer-generated action set pieces and a palpably inappropriate seriousness. Returning director Justin Lin (from the third installment ""The Fast & The Furious: Tokyo Drift"") impersonally helms this fourth installment that reunites its original lead cast for more physics-defying engines, brain-dead logic, scantily clad bimbos, and foot worship for good measure.Not that its target audience would primarily look for it but there's a plot and it involves Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) who's out to avenge the murder of a loved one courtesy of a drug kingpin. This leads him to another reluctant team-up with undercover FBI agent Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) and once again they are thrust into hazardous street racing from downtown LA to Mexico, and the run-of-the-mill narrative more or less goes into auto-drive from here.Largely debilitating for this latest hot rod project is its cliché-ridden script that has not a meager of inventiveness or eagerness, a sentiment apparently shared by its actors who are simply going through the motions, specially Diesel who highlights ""Fast & Furious""' misplaced intentness by exhibiting a labored sensitivity despite the caricature machismo. And though everything that has kept the series going is here gratuitously put at disposal, which is to say loads of wheels and hot-looking females, as a whole it starts to feel repetitive - a redundant profit-oriented scheme that cannot be saved by the sporadic appearance of Jordana Brewster.",Jay_Exiomo,2009-04-01,2009
3,10.0,"Great action, Nice cars and plenty of sexy babes too!","I built this movie of 6 reels last night and screened it in the theater where I work at , Great movie loved it, nice cars nice babes too! Plenty of action and some romance. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker getting a little aged. He (Walker) shows it too when getting his ass kicked by Vin screaming and kicking like a little girl that he is, (funny) Jordana Brewster nice addition to the crew. Hope we see more of this sweet heart in the future! Muscle beats imports any day! you are 4 miles from your destination, you are now 1 mile from your destination! Liked #1, sorry to not see Vin in #2, #3 Tokyo Drift? Where did That one come from? Either way all 4 are great films and will continue to be watched by me on DVD's forever!",5klogiudice,2009-04-01,2009
4,7.0,The best of the series by a mile,"I just got back from the midnight screening of 'Fast & Furious' and I have to admit the movie very much exceeded my fairly low expectations for the film. While the original film was entertaining, it was never a good movie by any means. Let's not even get started on the two that followed. The fourth installment however, is another story. Most of the original cast has come back and seeing them back in action together really makes you realize the F&F franchise isn't the same without them. The chemistry between the three leads (Diesel, Walker and Brewster) is the strongest it's been yet, and I would dare to call several of the scenes 'moving' as a result. Who would have ever expected that from Fast & Furious. The movie does an excellent job of keeping you on the edge of your seat, there's no shortage of action and a story that keeps your attention. The movie starts out in the DR with Vin Diesel pulling off a fairly implausible heist of hijacking a fuel tanker with his new crew. Minutes later, we learn of Letty's murder which in turn basically sets the tone for the rest of the movie as Diesel sets off on an all out rampage to even the score. Like the previous three, you certainly need to suspend your disbelief for the duration of the movie, however I was glad to see they didn't go overboard and kept the special effects and CIG to what seemed like a happy minimum. Anyone who's ever been a fan of the Fast and the Furious series will absolutely need to go see this on the big screen. Even if you weren't so hot for the originals, the movie is still worth a look. In my opinion it's acting, story, plot, special effects are the best of the series so far and almost makes it stand out as a respectable movie. Better yet, they've left the door wide open for 'Fast & Furious 5'. To be continued...",phatrick88,2009-04-02,2009
5,8.0,A complete reboot of the franchise,"How do I sum up Fast and Furious. Well before I go any further let me just say that it was everything I expected and more. This movie was a reboot for the franchise, just as much as Batman Begins was for batman, Casino Royal was for Bond, The Incredible HULK was for the hulk series etc. It features a lot more of a dramatic storyline then the other movies and isn't just a complete popcorn flick displaying a lot of emotion and relasionships between the characters. The movie almost seems to play out now as more of a crime drama then a racing movie, but also features a lot of the racing high paced action we know and love.Well on with the characters/story for the movie. This movie features a returning cast from the past The Fast and the Furious movies. We have Vin Deisel back as Dom, Paul Walker back as Brian, Michell Rodriguez as Letty, Jordan Brewster as Mia, and other characters that return in the form of camio appearances(just to let you know, no Tyrese or Lucas Black). I thought all of the characters did a really good job, and their relasionships and emotions were explored a lot more. So the acting is a big upgrade from the past movies, but don't be stupid enough to compare it to Oscar winning performances or expect them to be at that level. The characters do their jobs and are all very likable.Now with the story, basically without many spoilers, the gang is brought together by the murder of a mutual friend. So Brian and Dom work together to find the killer, and to bring down a huge criminal organization. At the same time Brian struggles with his loyalties to his job and to his friends who are on completely different sides of the law, and is forced to make a choice on whether hes a ""good guy playing a bad guy or a bad guy playing a good guy"" (as Mia puts it). So ya its straight forword but a solid plot that really sets up the whole movie, and is not just a completely brainless popcorn flick.All in all Fast and Furious was a very worthwhile movie. In terms of where it stands in the franchise it greatly supasses 2f2f and Tokeyo Drift, and even manages to be as good as or better then the first one in some aspects. If I had to choose Id say the first was better, but this one definitely stands up and is a worthwhile addition to the series. Anyways I give Fast and Furious an 8/10 and totally recommend seeing it in theaters, as it is totally worth $10, and you will only get one chance to see all the action on the big screen where it is at its best.",merce_hoola,2009-04-02,2009
6,8.0,Definitaly better than Tokyo Drift,"I saw this movie about an hour ago.. overall i was pretty pleased with it the action is great. but the writing was a bit off some of the dialogue seemed corny and unnecessary.. i found my self almost laughing at lines that were supposed to be dramatic.. kinda like in twilight. id say it wasn't as good as the first but definitely the second best of the series.. the reason the first was better is because JA RULE was in it ha.. its not how you stand by your car, its how you race your car haha..only other complaint i guess is that its not really about racing anymore.. for example the first one was more about the culture of underground street racing.oh and Mia in this movie is a bit scary i guess she forgot how she did the original role because she almost looks like she has a joker smile ha",coreycat09,2009-04-02,2009
7,10.0,Fantastic & Fabulous movie,"The movie is awesome man ,just awesome.U cant afford to miss it.I saw this first day first show & liked it very much.Now listening the films OSTs.Vin Diesel delivered his best after a long time.His last movie Babylon A D was a huge flop (in terms of revenue,though i liked his bad a$$ acting as a retired mercenary.In this Vin Diesel delivers his best,he just picks it up where he left off in F&F 1.The story also tries to tie the loose ends & answer some questions which were in the fans minds.Paul Walker also did great job.He added some comic timings in the movie which could make u laugh in some serious moments.I never liked Michelle nor Jordana,so I wont comment on them.Gal Gadot is the new chick whom u should look for ;).IMO shes hotter than other two.Shes the new girl on the F&F series :D Btw don't miss the opening of the movie.Coz start from the beginning,the movie has some great car revving & tire screeching scenes.When u have nice cars,Vin Diesel,Gal Gadot.Do u need a plot? If u want a plot driven go watch The Wrestler or Changeling :P Anyways coming back to the point,this movie deserves a watch at theaters only.Btw this is not the last installment of the series.....at least we can hope so.Rating : I give 4 out 5 Why did I cut the 1 out 5?Coz at the beginning there was Spanish to which no subs was provided :D",spycid,2009-04-02,2009
8,10.0,Go See It!!!!!!,"#### the critics.. They don't know what they are talking about.. This movie is simply awesome and worth seeing..Ladies, Gentlemens, Boys & Girls.. Go to the nearest theater and see it..There are a few minor (plot)holes in the movie but they are easy to ignore because it's simply the best movie of the year in my opinion...This movie is for everyone..Just head out, sit down and enjoy a movie that will blow your mind.. I just think that this movie should have been made before Tokyo Drift but that's my opinion...That's all from me!!!.. Now, go out and see!!!",Michaelj-29,2009-04-02,2009
9,6.0,Again,"Before i write anything about the movie the reason they make sequels is for money especially this one since they brought back the original cast. If you like the fast and the furious saga then definitely this is a must see, they brought back the two hottest stars of the saga for the sequel. The plot like usual isn't what captures the viewers attention, its always the cars and hot girls. They reunited Vin Diesel and Paul Walker which is great but we don't want to see the same cars again. Nissan Skyline is a great tuner vehicle but we've seen it before same goes for the American muscle. This one has similarities like the first movie of the series which is the drama scenes which were a lot more than the action sequences. The action sequences done in the car were eye catching but the chase done on feet was unrealistic and brutal, even the first action scene where Diesel drives under the gasoline truck was plain ‘stupid’. The first one was about the tuned up cars and the storybetween Paul walker and Vin diesel, 2nd one was about crime and alittle action, third one was fully about drifting, and now they reunited the hottest stars of the saga to recreate the magic of the trilogy. It has everything except the ‘magic’,it relvoves around the death of Michelle Rodriguez which is already a downfall since she is proabaly the best girl for the job. The critics have bashed this movie, some critics say it's 8thgrader vocabulary used in the script, but lets be straight forward we don't watch movies like this for stories or the never ending drama, if we wanted watch movies like that we'll only watch Oscar nominated movies. Action flicks like these are enjoyed by viewers, scenes that capture your attention and blow you away, making the impossible stunts possible. From what i heard there is a 5th installment which is good news for people who love cars from American muscle to tuned up skyline's. I am excited about the 5th version only if Micheal bay could direct the movie it will certainly have extraordinary chase sequences.If you liked the first three then it's worth a look, don't get overly manipulated by the critics and watch it for entertainment value and don't expect the story to be creative. I wouldn't rate this movie out of 10 but it deserves a 6 just for the fact many scenes could have been improved maybe they cut back on the budget but it's worth viewing it at the big screen.",babu_145,2009-04-02,2009
10,6.0,Same formula,"Comparing the original, I would say this sequel falls short of expectation. The storyline is very cliché and it is very predictive. Its the same tried and tested formula, similar to the 1st two movies. I don't see the Fast and Furious series movie this way. Tokyo Drift brought something different to the table, which I've to give Justin Lin the credit for it. This movie however goes back to the preview plot outlines of 1 and 2. Vin and Paul don't bring conviction in their roles, which I feel they probably opted for this movie for the sake of it.On the whole its popcorn fun. You get to see fast cars, hot chicks and good action sequences.I rate it 6/10",vishr,2009-04-02,2009
11,8.0,Now that's what being FAST is about!!!,"FAST..........FASTER and.......FASTEST.........all three words describe this one helluva action packed n pacey roller coaster ride........... The Movie opens to an exceedingly amazing action sequence where Dom n his friends, including Letty try to do what they are best at.......yup u right heist.........WOW!!! what a scene. Right after that the movie takes a serious path for a short while. Where Dom leaves Letty sleeping n goes away from her n goes to Panama. That's where he receives a bad news about someone's death(i won't disclose it) but it was a shock.......coz dat was d best character in d series. He then sets out to track down the one responsible. In comes Mr O'Connor looking like that something has changed and believe me it has changed for the better This 'New Model, Old Parts' is working. The action sequences are perfectly shot, Direction is cool, acting was amazing, Vin was cool as ever, the jokes were on the right place and in the right proportion. I thought it was better than Fast And The Furious(part 1). Although in the fast paced movie the script wasn't given much emphasis. But who needs a detailed script if the screenplay is damn good and can keep you on the edge of your seat. I go for 8 out of 10 for Fast and Furious 4.........The Fast just got Faster.....and how. GO WATCH IT!!!........coz u won't regret......",Tim_Jade,2009-04-02,2009
12,10.0,"Great movie, better than present movies","This is a great movie. A lot of action, deep drama, common-sense dialogue. This is pretty much a little grown up movie. This is definitely not a video game kind of movie. Vin Diesel is good in this movie with deep drama and struggle. I liked the dialogue that was real world. I liked the cars.This movie is definitely recommended for all younger people if you like or not like cars. This movie also doesn't have too much racing, which is fine. Watch the movie and your weekend will be much more entertaining. Ending was great too.Director Justin Lin did a fine job of directing the movie, which is crucial to sequel movies that tend to lose the depth and character development. He actually made it more serious movie than I expected and character development is well. I was expecting non-sense 24/7 racing with no dialogue, which it wasn't like that.",tom1111,2009-04-02,2009
13,8.0,Is this one the best one yet?,"This was a good movie. They were able to bring back all the things that made the first one great like Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, and Paul Walker, and let go of the things that did not work so well. All the things that you loved in the first one are here and a little more. Vin Diesel does a great job from start to finish. In parts of the movie it almost makes you want to leave your seat and cheer. For all you Paul Walker haters out there he did a good job as well. He is like a backup quarterback in the NFL you want him to manage the game don't try to do to much just do what is takes to win. Walker is not the star of the movie, but behind the star he manages his part well. He does a good job of playing his part and not going beyond that and try to make a great performance. Walker acts within his ability. I for one am not a Walker hater so I never felt like he did a bad job, but I know there are a lot of you out there and you will be happy with his performance in this movie. Just the right blind of action and cars. For all the people that loved Han from Tokyo Drift don't get really excited, his role is only for about 3 minutes at the beginning of the movie. This is not a movie that is going to win any Academy Awards, but it is a movie that will keep you entertain for an hour and forty five minutes. Worth the movie to pay to see this one in the theater. Which is saying a lot for the way the economy is right now. It is the best one in the series.",blake-brown20,2009-04-02,2009
14,7.0,"All Told a Good, Enjoyable Entry","It goes without saying that the Fast and Furious franchise hasn't had a good run with the critics. Yet the films have had a mostly fair run at the box office, so they've gradually been released. The first entry is almost unanimously regarded as the best in the series while the second and third are typically frowned upon. For my two cents, the first and third are about equal while the second is best kept as a distant, forgettable memory. Given that this film is coming from Justin Lin, who directed Tokyo Drift, the least that should be expected are some well shot action scenes involving cars. Though enthusiasts of the series will also be looking for satisfaction to the story as well. Does it succeed? Yes, in most ways. The film opens with a bang as Dom, Han (from Tokyo Drift) and a couple other unknowns to the series attempt to steal some gas tank trailers off of a truck which, needless to say, doesn't go without a hitch. After this and a quickly filled in plot piece, we find out that Letty gets murdered and Dom naturally seeks revenge and returns to the U.S. With this and a current assignment, Brian O'Connor (from the first two films) is brought into the mix as he attempts to go after the same people Dom hunts down. The premise is decent enough with skepticisms and indecisiveness playing a large role between the characters. Speaking of the characters, one area of concern fans of the series might have is how well they're still executed and fleshed out after nearly ten year absence from each other (in regards to the film's release dates). Fortunately, the main cast mostly pulled off fair enough performances to stay convincing enough, though it isn't without some melodrama here and there. Fortunately, these moments aren't too frequent and don't hinder the film all that much. Diesel manages to pull of the usual 'just decent' performance that he's had in practically all of his films. Walker actually feels like the most fleshed out character and comes off as a better performer than Vin. As for the supporting cast, they're all just fair at best, with only one or two performances any better than that. But since this film is called ‘Fast and Furious’ and is part of that very franchise, what most people will likely expect going in is for it to be, well, fast and furious. In this sense, the film does succeed quite well. Credit definitely has to be given to Lin for the action scenes involving the cars. The action in these parts are frantic and very exciting, with plenty of awesome, speeding cars to add adrenaline to these scenes. If there's anything you'll want to do at the end of the film, it'll be to get in your car and start shattering the speed limits. What Fast and Furious does best is give you an adrenaline rush during its action scenes. The film lives up to its name and will give those wanting some great car action sequences something to enjoy. When action isn't the focus of the film, it's far easier to find issues and be a bit turned off. But if you're a series fan you should be able to enjoy most of what the film offers and will likely walk away quite satisfied as I did. The first and third films are still my favorites in the series, but this installment is about as good as the first film and is miles above the laughable 2 Fast 2 Furious.",Hellrazr360,2009-04-03,2009
15,2.0,Review of the 4th and Comments on the F&F Series as a whole,"No doubt they will be making a 5th as these movies are cheap enough to make and still moderately successful with the built in fan base. I say with the built in fan base because, with the lack believability of the 3rd one and the 4th one, no one but the rice boys would want to see a 5th one!!! I could write a better script and be a better director than Lin ever thought of being (remember interview where he said he was not a car guy)!!! The 3rd one was just stupid as it was so unrealistic and had no real character development; it just seemed to be a stereotypically western view of Japan. Yakuza and drifting, sure FF4 is just too slow at the start, feeling more like a bad episode of ""Cops"" or something. It was just kind of boring, and it was not like there was any real character development. And, as usual (except for the FF2 to a degree; i.e. FF2 was kind of like Miami Vice), there was no real believable plot; using a secret tunnel and street racers to smuggle drugs, sure, whatever... The races in the movie were just far to scattered, like they wanted to make this a movie about everything except the cars, heck they only showed an R35 once that I could tell (the red car on the screen when Brain is selecting his car) and used the R34 a few times. It felt like it just went on-and-on with its bad take on a cop drama. I was ready to leave before the ending credits, sad... It really felt like they wanted to have some type of one dimensional character development, like they wanted to make a serious work, but it fails at that. It also tries to tie up the ""loose ends"" as they stated they would do, but again, I don't think they should have tried. And Brain back with the FBI, what was with that? I thought that at the end of the 2nd one he was going to open up a tuning garage, what happened? Heck, that could have been more interesting; Brain gets involved with something that has to do with his new tuning shop and some kind of, well heck, organized crime (yes, that does seem to be the only answer the script writers have with this series of movies as a plot engine)! And of course, the end of FF4 works perfectly into the soon-to-be 5th installment! I see it; now Dominic and Brain must flee the USA to Europe and get involved in stopping the smuggling of, you know it, drugs! Oh, and Universal, if you want someone who can really make a real car movie, see me",roadbuster-1,2009-04-03,2009
16,8.0,Way better than expected,"This was what I was looking for. Raw action, Hot girls, Amazing cars, Original cast. This is what the third movie should have been. Probably the best action movie released in a few years. Less teenage wanna be street race punks and more actual story line involved with this movie. I'm not sure how anyone could down rate this movie unless they actually are intending to. You know what your going to go see when you go to see a title like this. I was pleasantly surprised. Bringing the original cast really payed off, seeing Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and the amazingly beautiful Jordana Brewster back in this film really tied the story together. Definitely a movie to go see in the theaters.",weird_guy81,2009-04-03,2009
17,10.0,Loved it!,"I loved this movie. So much things in it that make me wish that all the Fast and the Furious movies had these two in them. Towards the end of this movie, Dom gets sentenced to 25 to life in prison. You can obviously tell that O'Conner does not like this and storms out of the court room. Then you see Dom on a prison bus, but behind it you see 4 tuned up cars racing up behind the bus. Then it shows O'Conner and Doms sister, and a few other people. Then the movie ends. I really hope to see more Fast and the Furious movies with these two in them. It was simply amazing, I strongly recommend going to the theater and seeing this movie. I HOPE THAT THEY MAKE ANOTHER ONE OFF OF THAT ENDING!!!",flemingc11,2009-04-03,2009
18,10.0,A reunion thats worth attending.,"The first Fast and the furious movie was something like a phenomenon for me as a teenager. It had amazing cars, gorgeous girls and introduced two stars to the mainstream audience, Paul Walker & Vin Diesel. The second film only brought back one of them..and while it wasn't terrible, the vibe and energy from the first seemed to be drained out due to this actors presence missing. I wont even begin to explain my disliking of the third film aside from its direction, because we would be here for hours. Finally, for whatever reason, maybe money, maybe careers not going where they were supposed to, these two guys came back together along with their love interests from the first film..and I, for one, am happy that it went down. The action sequences are top notch, easily the best in the series. The cars are AMAZING..if you are a car guy you will flat out love the choices in the film. The acting is..well, tolerable. I read reviews for this film laughing out loud. It sounded like critics were expecting Slumdog Millionaire. Come on people..its the fast and the furious. It is supposed to be fun, loud and exciting. Not Oscar worthy. I don't want to give away anything like most reviews do because i know fans of the series would rather see it for themselves. It is satisfying and i would say, almost as good as the original. For its action sequences, pace and overall feel..i give the film a 10/10.",furiousneon,2009-04-03,2009
19,8.0,"A Fun, Fast Ride!","While this second movie of Vin Diesel's ‘Fast and Furious’ Trilogy did not impress me as much as its predecessor, ‘The Fast and The Furious’  did, it was definitely worth my money and time, I thoroughly enjoyed every speeding second! The film will meet your expectations of a good plot, witty humor, fast cars, sexy people and down-to-earth fun, and might even have you gripping your seat in a few of the fast-paced driving scenes. While this second movie does not have as many awesome cars as the first film, ‘The Fast and the Furious’ did, it still keeps you wanting more of the unbelievable yet awesomely choreographed driving and action sequences it boasts throughout the entire movie. Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew are back in action once again, ready to kick butt and take names in the second of what will be three great, fun-filled movies, so if you enjoyed the first film, I definitely recommend you see this one!",limelybean,2009-04-03,2009
20,10.0,Great Movie.....Feed the need for Speed,"This is a great movie. Vin and Paul come back, Michelle and Jordana are still there it was great to pick up where everyone else left off at. Sure that in the time since Brian (Walker) had found out that its been Dom (Diesel) ripping off the trucks that he had gone off to Miami to bring in drug lord and recover missing money. Then the whole series takes off to Tokyo where it had nothing to do with the original cast or the original plot. Dom is kicking it down in the Dominican Republic with Letty (Rodriguez) pulling the same stuff they did in L.A. Dom leaves to save Letty but she ends up getting murdered by the new gang in town headed by a Columbian drug Cartel. The Charger/Challenger (not sure which one Dom has) makes it comeback only to get destroyed once more. Other than the typical Brian working for the government to bring in the bad guy and having a love affair with Mia (Brewster) in the process while still trying to save Dom...this movie was great. Fast cars, hard hits, hot women....this one returns to the true F&F fashion of feeding the need for speed.",gothicraige,2009-04-03,2009
21,8.0,best one yet!,"This film, unlike the second and third installment, had a strong plot. if you like the F&F Franchise and go into the theater with a positive attitude, you will not be disappointed. unlike any other installment in the franchise, there is a much bigger variety of cars as well. much more of that good ol' American Muscle. and who can you think of that looks more bada$$ than Vin Diesel behind the wheel of a Chevelle and a Charger? and not to mention the babes! I mean thats what this series is all about right?Cars, babes, and mischief.overall, if you dig the franchise as much as i do, or even if u just like cars and racing, this is the movie for you. it is much more action packed than all of the other ones.",badblueboyz77,2009-04-03,2009
22,6.0,Very Fast Very Furious,"It should have been called ‘The Fast and The Furious - The Dark Tunnels’ or ‘The Fast and The Furious - The Traffic Re-Routers;  Drifting was a big event in FF3 which is a pie cake for everyone in this installation. If you compare all releases on Fast and Furious, the 1st Installation still rocks! Then after that comes FF4, then Tokyo Drift and the least exciting was the second part. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) crazily kept on changing his mind which route to take while driving. He did this all the time in the movie. If he reached a dead-end, he quickly routed his car to a new path. Amazing ! The only thing which I think had potential was when they come to rescue Vin Diesel in the end. The writers could have kept it for the next installation along with a fast-on-feet, jailbreak chase sequence. Very few street races, Amazing Direction, very few scenes for Michelle (Laticia/Letty). I feel a bit cheated because I expected to watch Jordana Brewster (Mia) who had not many scenes in the movie. Definitely a good watch!",quaker-9,2009-04-03,2009
23,8.0,Fast & Furious rocks!,"'Fast & Furious' is escapist cinema at its very best. The film is gripping, interesting, and most of all entertaining. I enjoyed the movie completely, its a power-packed entertainer. Two Thumbs Up!Pluses of the film: The film is gripping. Oustanding action sequences. Witty and catchy dialogue. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker deliver superb performances. Diesel in is top from, while Walker plays his part effortlessly. The chicks are decent.Minuses: The twist in the tale, arrives to early. I am talking about Diesel's track.On the whole, 'Fast & Furious' rocks. Go for this one!",namashi_1,2009-04-03,2009
24,7.0,Mediorce At Times But Always Entertaining,"When a crime brings them back to L.A., fugitive ex-con Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) reignites his feud with agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker). But as they are forced to confront a shared enemy, Dom and Brian must give in to an uncertain new trust if they hope to outmanuever him. And from convoy heists to precision tunnel crawls across international lines, two men will find the best way to get revenge: push the limits of what's possible behind the wheel. Like i said before it is very mediorce with various racing scenes but Vin and Paul once again deliver a fun, fast and very furious masterpiece that can replace the embarrassment of Tokyo Drift. Fast And Furious 7/10",MCMAYNERBERRY,2009-04-03,2009
25,7.0,A Nutshell Review: Fast & Furious,"The tagline caught my attention, promising a brand new movie with the original cast of Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster. With the relative box office success of the first film, the sequel 2 Fast 2 Furious saw only Walker returning, with Tyrese trying very hard to step into the big frame of Diesel's without much success. Tokyo Drift picked up the adrenaline from the East's Initial D, injecting the franchise with some Asian flavour, though the only good thing out of that was the introduction of Sung Kang's character Han. So the 4th movie tries to bring together all the best characters to appease fans, and the timeline of this installment sits snugly in between the first and second movies where we learn that Han and Toretto do go all the way back together. Perfect.Vin Diesel had The Fast and the Furious back in 2001 to thank for in making him a household name, where every fan boy out there left the theatres chanting his name and wishing they could emulate his road stunts if given a car as powerful as that in the film. However we know how he turned his back on a franchise, and how his film career had turned out recently, with stinkers such as Babylon A.D. crowding out his filmography. If he's sorely in need of a return to form, then I guess it doesn't take much rocket science to figure out that he would be tempted to return to his Dominic Toretto roots after his cameo in Tokyo Drift.It was smart of Justin Lin to have featured Torretto in his film then just to whet the appetites of fans everywhere, and to helm this installment by trying to top the first film by getting the first cast all back. However, some parts do get rusty after so long, and in wanting to stamp his authority over the original, had made some drastic decisions in order to keep the engine fine tuned and purring. Since it's before the second movie, Toretto is still an outlaw, and Paul Waker's Brian O'Conner is now working for the FBI, before his unexplained turn to crime in 2 Fast 2 Furious, which gets explained here, if you wish of course.The plot doesn't drift away from the standard cop-robber formula, with a cat and mouse game brewing involving a drug run from Mexico and the USA making use of expert drivers to be couriers between the two countries. And when murder is in the name of the game, Toretto gets involved for vengeance, and O'Conner, well, just doing his job. It's just an excuse to see the Diesel-Walker team up, and the franchise's formula dictates plenty of random scantily clad girls gyrating in front of the camera, while hot cars with modified engines gleam seductively under dim garages, and the screeching of tyres when tearing up the roads.If a race movie is not your cup of tea (after so many copycats have come out to milk fans of the genre), then this franchise offers nothing new. Granted that Hollywood doesn't do car chases like it used to, relying a lot now on plenty of computer animation and graphics to spice up the sequences and entertain. Those itching to see a lot of action will have to contend with only 4 major set action pieces, with 2 of which happen in the same tunnel, one bringing back memories from the first film in a heist that doesn't go exactly right, and one being the nod back to Tokyo Drift in having a downtown city area night time race.Fans of the franchise will still find this a worthy addition, but everyone else would wonder why the effort. If this film continues to make money, I won't be surprised if the next film picks up from where Tokyo Drift left off, maybe with the return of Lucas Black's Sean Boswell joining the new crew in a new adventure, with new cars to smash, new babes to romance, and more nitro to burn up the tracks.",DICK STEEL,2009-04-03,2009
26,6.0,Don't waste your money,"I just wasted 2 hours of my live and $8 watching this piece of crap film. The only thing that kept me in my seat until the end was my love of the original F&F movie. I was glad that this one brought back the original cast, but seriously - the writers and directors of this one should be shot, along with the makers of that lame ass Tokyo Drift"". The acting was so beyond bad that I couldn't watch at times. One car race scene (in the city) was awesome, but the rest of the movie just looked like a cheap James Bond / Jason Bourne ripoff. Don't waste your money on this one, wait until it comes out on DVD and then you can watch it at home and make all the fun you want of it!",amanda_n_byrum,2009-04-03,2009
27,7.0,"Thumbs up for Laz Alonzo, but ya gotta show more of the ladies!","Okay world, we have a new bad guy, a new nemesis, a new Hollywood heavy, Fenix Rise played by Laz Alonzo. Although billed as a supporting cast member, Mr. Alonzo carries this movie. He saves this otherwise routine action movie from cinematic complacency. The movie has a flimsy story, a ridiculous plot, and good if not exceptional acting from the two leads. Vin Diesel is always wonderful, but he's not the same great character from the original. However, the beautiful Jordana Brewster gives a credible performance but the incredible Michelle Rodriguez is practically no where to be found, which further weakens the movie. Why Ms. Rodriguez is given so little play is puzzling and her absence lowers the temperature of this movie by several degrees. Actresses like Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster are meant to be seen and admired, so, Hollywood, please showcase them because they are wonderful ... and hot.",PWNYCNY,2009-04-03,2009
28,7.0,Better than the 1st movie,"I just saw this and to be honest I was hesitant in buying the $8 matinée ticket but wanted to see a movie and figured what the heck. First of all the 1st film was good, IMO the sequel and then Tokyo Drift were pretty bad but the 4th installment gave a ray of hope when I first saw the trailer. I liked the fact that it had a large part of the original cast.I enjoyed this film and was surprised. They actually wrote a good story and it flowed very well, the action and driving scene's were shot and edited superbly, you did get the feeling that you were in the car at times which adds to the intensity of the driving scenes. I also like the fact that they incorporated American muscle cars instead of just imports this way the movie will appeal to people of all tastes. Overall I was pleasantly surprised of how good the film was. Also the final scene of Phoenix's demise was different than the norm. Bottom line Go see it.",tonyzeno75,2009-04-03,2009
29,6.0,Fast...but not so Furious,"The fourth film in the series, Fast & Furious is full of action but misses the mark once again. In my opinion, the film is much better than the previous two, as the original cast including Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, and Michelle Rodriquez return. However, something has not returned from the original and that is the CARS. I could count the number of cars that interested me on one hand, and that is not a good thing. And once again, Paul Walker is driving a skyline and Vin Diesel is driving his American muscle. Come on where is the new stuff? Walker is an FBI agent and Diesel is his typical outlaw self. Both work together in bringing down one of the most powerful drug dealers in the country and they do a great job. The movie is full of action, with multiple entertaining action scenes. But what is missing are the most important factors of a Fast and Furious movie: street racing, tuners, and a plot people can actually relate with. The first film was so popular because, although it was a box office movie, it was full of real people and their actual cars. Fast and Furious 4 is too unrealistic with too much CGI...the director should have gone back to the roots of street racing.",Magalhaes9,2009-04-03,2009
30,6.0,More fun with horsepower,"This fourth entry in the tough-guy, street-racer, busty-babe franchise is, and is not, worthy of the first. It's brought back the original actors, and they still look good. It's got at least one of the original street races. But now, as the opening sequence shows, it's joined the blockbuster rush and shifted over into a CGI-world of preposterously extravagant video-game car events. This intro is like the overkill prelude of 'Quantum of Solace.' Both movies show a trend toward numbing their audiences out with speed and violence in the opening shots, instead of quietly warming them up. It's not a good strategy. 'Fast & Furious' is replete with action that's neither credible nor as integral to the plot as it ought to be, or as the action was in the first in the series, Rob Cohen's 'The Fast and the Furious' (2001), which itself was a glossier reimagining of the kind of cheapie Fifties and Sixties fast-car movies Tarantino plays with in 'Death Proof.' But this one's still got tough guys and busty babes. It's got colorful muscle cars for hot-rodders to drool over. And it's got bright, clear images that are often beautiful. Though they don't quite offset the choppy editing, they punctuate it in an esthetically pleasing way.In the first film Dom (Vin Diesel) disappeared into Mexico. Diesel missed the second episode, seemingly holding out for better career opportunities that didn't quite materialize. His big star vehicle, the 2002 'xXx,' was a bust, despite the presence of B-picture diva Asia Argento. He did star in Sidney Lumet's quirky trial drama, 'Find Me Guilty', if anybody remembers. Having reappeared in episode three, Tokyo Drift (like this directed by Justin Lin), Dom's now living in the Dominican Republic with his girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez). (Note for devotees: in time this new movie fits between episodes three and four.) It's Dom and Letty in the opening frames, stealing a multiple-unit truckload of oil. But their trickery defies the laws of physics and human dexterity too much to matter, even if it weren't too soon to get our adrenalin to pump that hard. Vin's still as muscled and macho; he was lumpen before; now he's just a little thicker. So is his delivery of dialogue, which now has an extra half-second delay. But there's something that makes it hard not to like Vin.Paul Walker (as Brian O'Connor) is similarly likable, with a prettier face. He doesn't have the bottle-blond golden boy look of the original 'The Fast and the Furious,' but he still has a square-jawed, sterling quality mingled with toughness that suits his role here as, now, a cop who turns rogue (or a rogue turned cop; he's not sure) aiming to serve higher ends--but unwilling to betray his old street-racing, law-breaking buddies. He aims to catch a drug kingpin his police boss seems content to let by, but he's forever loyal to Dom.Walker, like Diesel, has star quality, though he too has not exactly had a blockbuster career. He did, however, star in the mind-bendingly over-the-top action flick 'Running Scared,' and got to play the martyred Marine platoon leader in Eastwood's 'Flags of Our Fathers.' Though the plot of 'Fast & Furious' may not always serve Walker and Diesel as well as it should, there's an authenticity about their line delivery still that puts across the myth of their camaraderie and loyalty to a code that Dom has, and Brian is still working on.At least the movie has the sense to make the opening hijack attempt a failure. It leads Dom to go and hide out in L.A. with his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster), who used to be Brian's girlfriend. That flame, predictably, is easily reignited when the plot needs a romantic boost.In the street race sequence, Dom has a GPS screen with a woman's soothing voice (that of Gal Gadot, an exotic new addition to the femmes list) to show the big boy and us where he is in his trajectory. This shows the influence of Paul WS Anderson's 'Death Race,' which took the car race genre up a notch. Alas, though, the slick technology takes us further away from the personal, homemade quality of street racing, which in the first episode was about horsepower and garage work and macho taunts, not visual stunts and hi tech screens. Despite all the crashes (more often head-over-heels than in real life) these movies make racing on the roads look safer than it should, which is why this movie has a detailed ""DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME"" disclaimer at the end. (And there is stunt driving in this movie, even though it's undercut by the CGI tricks.) You'd better believe that warning. Better not to drive at top speed into a half-shut Mexican mountain tunnel. And don't try catching a guy your pal has just dropped out a window, either.It remains to be seen if this movie, which is still fun and fast, helps Diesel and Walker on to the star rules they may deserve, or, what seems equally possible, just sidetracks them further. Lovers of the franchise are not going to be howling with disappointment, but new converts at this stage seem unlikely.",Chris Knipp,2009-04-03,2009
31,10.0,Fast & Furious 2.5,"I have read all previous comments and only see a couple of people that actually make a comment that it is supposed to happen between 2 Fast 2 Furious and Tokyo Drift... I'm sure this had something to do with Justin Lin directing Tokyo Drift as well as Fast & Furious. I'm glad that he made it happen that way because I am sure there were many people that saw Tokyo Drift and thought, ""Where did this movie come from?"" It was so random to have it be a Fast and Furious movie when it had nothing to do with either of the original 2 with the exception of the again, random, cameo of Dom at the end of it. In the first couple of scenes of Fast & Furious you see that Han is part of Dom's crew that hi-jacks gas tankers in the Dominican Republic. When the heat is on Dom once again, he tells Han it's time to go do his own thing. Han tells him that he hears of some things going on in Tokyo. If you recall in Tokyo drift, Han tells Sean that Tokyo is his ""Mexico"" he was running to stay out of jail.I really enjoyed this movie. The plot wasn't as detailed as the previous but it followed along well with what you think might happen in a Fast & Furious movie... Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner again, he is still working law enforcement, although this time he is big boy FBI. Vin Deisel is back as Dominic Toretto. He and Brian are trying to get in with a drug ring for different reasons, but team up to help each other get what they are after.The movie is full of everything you expect from the franchise: Nice cars, great racing, hot women and hot guys (to suit everyone's taste) This movie has great action sequences as well. I recommend this movie to anyone that has followed the other 3... or at least the first 2. If they make a 5th one I'll be first in line to see it too.",amboo61,2009-04-03,2009
32,3.0,Slow and Plodding!,"Really, Fast & Furious is plain misleading, the title should have been Slow n Plodding. What an absolute drag.Exhibit A - Directionless director. With random hand-held camera, incredibly jerky footage, fast cuts all over, you never really get to see anything good. Of the cars at least. The races seemed like they were directed by Michael Bay. Every thing kept exploding and crashing. It was horrible!Exhibit B - Dom's double chin. Humungous, monstrous double chin. Bigger than his bald head. A mutant double chin. His evil doppleganger, even. Sure, I'm being superficial here, but it's a movie, and your job is to look good. Dom is tough muscle-head. A double chin just looks plain ugly!Exhibit C - The story. I think there was one, but I could be wrong.What was real good to see on the screen was some very nice mid-riff closeups of Michelle Rodriguez. Plus that other skank who shows up halfway through the movie, falls for Dom, and thrusts her real hard nipples towards him. He still turns her down. Go figure.",bottleHeD,2009-04-03,2009
33,9.0,I have to start off with I'm a fan of the franchise. . .,"Now that that's out of the way, this movie goes from ZERO to 90 in 45 seconds. Then it's off to the races my friend, where it doesn't let up 45 minutes later when your in the parking lot of your local movie theater driving off in your car. Forget what you know about the franchise, if you want an ADRENALINE rush it'll be TOO LARGE! You can say what you want about ALL THE originals coming back, but you know what they're a team and they bring out the BEST in each other every time. It's FANTASTIC to see Vin Diesel (DOM), Michelle Rodriguez (Letty), Paul Walker (Brian), & Jordana Brewster (Mia) all reprising roles that brought your attention to them in the first movie. I love that we're in 2009 and technology has brought movies to such amazingly great speeds & heights. I've never seen it used more brilliantly then this is 2 and a half hour thrill ride. Dom's on the run, Brian's back with the FBI, and Mia's holding down the home front back in Cali. Well it wouldn't be a reunion if they all didn't come collide back together in misfortune,racing, and the world's BIGGEST drug trafficker. It just wouldn't be FAST and FURIOUS. Great cars, hot chicks, hot dudes, fantastic action sequences, and the best acting of their careers! GO see it and remember why you loved the first one, and be impressed. I honestly was",Ridonculous31,2009-04-04,2009
34,10.0,Well worth the $6.50 that I spent at the matinée.,"For one thing? There was the action-packed prologue. It had stunt work worthy of a James Bond movie. And, more importantly, it had a rare case of faithful continuity. Not only did Michelle Rodriguez return to play Letty. Sun Kang (as Han) was back, too!* *Making it appear that it was set a year or two before F&F: TOKYO DRIFT. Another thing this sequel had going for it was the return of Paul Walker, as Brian, and Jordana Brewster as Dom's sister, Mia. Eva Mendes was undeniably nice to look at, in 2F/2F. And, I'm sure, as Agent Fuentes, she provided a great release for any sexual tension Brian might have felt. But, Brian and Mia had much better chemistry! They proved this when they had their dramatic reunion in that little diner. I was wondering what he'd say when she demanded an explanation for his emotional betrayal of her. And, I was not disappointed. As far as I'm concerned, Brian's reply was delivered with complete believability! Of course, the _best_ thing this sequel had going for it was the return of Vin Diesel to straightforward action-adventure! Oh, he proved he could do light-hearted, family-friendly spoofs of it in the Disney flick, THE PACIFIER. But, I suspect the main reason he appeared in that film was just for the sake of professional variety. To prove he wasn't just a Right Said Fred look-alike who could take a punch (and dish it back out, twice as hard). So, if you haven't already seen it, go for it. The only way you could dislike it is if you disliked the first three movies in the franchise, as well.",Carycomic,2009-04-04,2009
35,5.0,Semi Mindless Action film,"Fast and Furious is certainly everything it promises, but that isn't a whole lot. We get all kinds of suped up cars that will give any sixteen year old the hots and the babes to make the illegal car racing all the more glamorous.Now when I say it's all babes and cars I mean it, there isn't any new character development in any of the characters and the action, while good, is extremely basic, but at least it isn't terrible.Entertaining for a viewing but it doesn't give us anything new to a franchise that has been extremely one note from the get go. Enjoy it and watch the racers act like rock stars! a very modest 6 out of 10",blindredemption,2009-04-04,2009
36,6.0,This is Fast and Furious!,"With the biggest budget in the Fast and Furious series, you can expect longer car chase scenes and see more cars crashing into each other. This seems to be the proper sequel to 2001 movie with all of the original cast. Yeah, this seems to be the best of the series. It has some of the best car chase scenes in the movies and the story is thrilling with suspense.The story: This has an actual story that manages to thrill unlike the previous sequel. Paul Walker and Vin Diesel are back to lead in the movie. Can't say much about the story, but it does pack some thrills and suspense with car racing/chasing scenes. There is nothing special about the story but it is at least entertaining and thrilling. Those who just get the thrill in seeing beautiful and sexy cars being smashed, this one don't disappoint. Cars toppling onto each other, cars smashing into each other. Plus there are hot babes. Looks good, right? Overall: Those who love the Fast and Furious series should obviously catch this one. Those who love car racing movies, this one don't disappoint. Those who love to see cars smashing each other and find that there are not many movies recently doing that, this one shall thrill you. I enjoyed it for the story and car chase scenes and nothing more.",helmutty,2009-04-04,2009
37,9.0,Cheese sure is tasty,"Ill be the first to tell you: Relative to a by the books ""good"" movie, this movie is horrendous. With that out of the way, Ill explain why its awesome and gets a 9 out of 10.Movies are about having fun, and quite honestly, its not often they pack as much fun in as this one. Lots of cheesy 1 liners, Lots of cheesy explosions, tons of references back to the first Fast and the furious, and lots of pretty sweet cars driving terribly doing absurd things. If you go in expecting anything but an action movie with a couple of semi-forced cheesy side stories, you're in the wrong movie. just sit back, stop thinking, and enjoy the ride.For the record, Im also a huge car guy (I legally race myself, do design and fab work for race cars, and am a mechanical engineer) and admittedly, the original movie is what got me started on cars when I was 14. Even to the car guy this movie is a complete joke, albeit a hilarious one. STi's without drive shafts, AWD cars doing RWD burnouts, and the list goes on with mishaps even with the subject matter. The whole point is that it doesn't matter at all and its just a pointless fun movie.enjoy!",Phanofmuzik-2,2009-04-04,2009
38,8.0,Way Better Than Expected,"A friend of mine convinced me to go to this movie on opening night. I gave in, figuring that it couldn't be too bad of a movie. Pretty much, right off the bat I was glued to it. Soo much happens in the beginning. Like the opening scene for example, when they're stealing the gas. Then to kick it off and give the movie a plot, Vin Diesels girlfriend gets killed off. They really thought this one through, this time. The action is great. Amazing cars and high flying. The ending is excellent. I like how they pull off the first scene idea, in the ending scene. VERY well done. I thought it'd be good. It was great! 8/10",canadian_roughneck,2009-04-04,2009
39,6.0,Slow & Tedious,"The general plot of the movie goes something like this: Dom (Vin Diesel) and his buds are at it again and stealing gas from poor South-American countries (I would like to think that they're doing this to destabilize a government that is based solely on irony). However, Dom realizes he can't mess with the feds that are out to get him, so naturally he takes to the road and gets the hell out of Dodge. But not for long, since a plot device that we were SO not expecting brings him to good old L.A., and by complete coincidence, in the middle of an FBI operation that has to take down a drug lord. We are told that this drug lord effectively manages to smuggle more dope than Escobar did in 10 years. While that in it's own right would just have to be pretty freaking awesome, we have to remember the fact that Escobar was responsible for about 80% of the drugs coming in and out of America in his time. Which kind of makes it obvious that this new drug lord would have to effectively control either half the U.S. fleet or literally be able to s**t transports on a daily basis... However, the movie wants to make us believe that he can do so with 4 guys a night, racing through a tunnel that just happens to be outside of the Mexican border's scanners, all the while running down from Mexico to America... Of course no one would think to post sentries there...As it turns out, Dom and Walker (Brian O'Conner) end up working on the same case, albeit for totally different reasons. In the end we get a plot twist that we SO didn't see coming, and an ending that just screams for another sequel to be made. Normally I'd say HELL YES! to something like that, if the movie had been what I expected. Read what follows to see why my response was something more on the lines of ""I'll see another one of these if you guys let me in for free. And give me hot chicks... or at least a free soda."".Why directors will choose to take the fun out of an otherwise brainless movie is something that will always manage to elude me. It somehow falls into the same category as things like why I can never find magical leprechauns that will hand me money or why some studios green-light scripts that smell of brain-fart from a mile away.I mean... I can totally understand that the movie chooses to pimp slap reality while screaming ""Who's your driver daddy!"" (I sometimes like to believe that it also throws in a sucker-punch every now and then), because that's what makes it fun. But then again, if you walk into a ""Fast & Furious"" movie expecting realism, you probably deserve the aforementioned treatment yourself... applied by Gremlins (because we all know how terrifying a Gremlin screaming ""Who's your daddy"" would be).Just to get this out of the way, I like cars. I love tuned cars. I love hot women that choose to wear belts as skirts, or wear dresses that don't have enough material to cover up 30% of their body. And if the movie had 90% of that and the rest had been composed entirely of Vin Diesel kicking a** and taking names while displaying absolutely no remorse or guilt, then I would have loved this movie. So much so, that I probably would have given it a 10 just for being composed of THAT much awesome (ok maybe a 9 because it just wouldn't have been in the same class of awesome as ""The Dark Knight""... unless one of the racing cars was the Batmobile, and the chicks around Batman had been dressed in Catwoman outfits).But no... instead we get 30% car racing and general bad-a**, 20% of Vin Diesel looking as if he's about to s**t bricks considering how muscularly constipated he looks, coupled with general bad-a**, and 50% I'm-sorry-for-banging-your-sister-and-then-taking-off-without-even leaving-a-note tear-jerking dialog that was hackneyed at best and cringe-worthy at worst. It basically sounded like a rejected sketch for a James Bond movie in which Sean Connery starts telling his newly acquired babe that it's too dangerous for her to stay around him, because he's got like... ninjas after him... or something. The reasons why that wouldn't stick are: 1. Sean Connery's brass testicles wouldn't allow him to utter such a thing.2. We all know James Bond probably doesn't care all that much.3. We all know WE wouldn't care all that much.In this case, reasons 1 and 3 apply more than ever. Why? Could it have to do with the fact that we get to know so little of the characters that we utterly can not give less of a rat's a** about them? Bingo! Because seriously... I didn't pay the admission price to weep at tear-jerking drama. I paid to watch fast cars and hot chicks. If I want depth, I'll watch ""Slumdog Millionaire"" or ""The Wrestler"", or ""Seven Pounds"". If I want hot spoilers and rims, and cars that have jet-engines put in them I'll probably just play Need for Speed. At least that game allows me not to care whether or not I kill innocent bystanders, let alone if any of the main characters gets dumped by their girlfriend or anything like that.",moldo_bmf,2009-04-04,2009
40,8.0,"All you need from an action movie.. engines, explosions and Vin Diesel",This movie picks up from where the first movie left off. Dominic(Vin Diesel) and Letty(Michelle Rodriguez) are hiding pulling jobs just for the fun of it but Dom knows that none's safe around him and decides to leave Letty. In the city FBI is trying to get their hands on the Drug-lord (Campos) and Brian (Paul Walker) is on the hunt. Letty makes a deal with Brian to cleanse Dom of all charges and in turn go in undercover as an informant. A job goes bad and she gets killed by the bad guy (Fenix) who works for Campos. Dom goes hungry for revenge and is back on the streets looking for the killer. Brian and Dom team up in catching these bad guys and of course Dom kills Felix. In between all this plot is extreme street racing with big engines and loads of action. The movie is well directed and fully satiates your hunger for action adventure and speeding cars. I just loved the first movie so i always wanted the same cast appearing again and thankfully this one didn't disappoint. Vin Diesel is as good as ever.. his screen presence is phenomenal and rest of the cast is great too. I quite liked the opening car race sequence and the rest of the movie was good enough to keep me glued to the chair. Well in the end Dom gets a trial and Brian as an FBI officer testifies and pleads for dropping of all charges but court finds him guilty and sentences 25 years. Brian and Dom's sister get furious with all this and try to get Dom out and thats where it ends. Another open ending for a possible sequel which makes everyone happy i guess.,WalkThatTalk,2009-04-04,2009
41,10.0,Great Re-invention of the F&F,"Don't Liston to the Bull from haters. This is a GREAT Movie for the Action racer at heart. It's not about heavy story line or great dialog. It's about the code of friendship, and fast cars with big mucilage.enjoy with that attitude and you will end felling faster and with more ferocity in life.I myself have a 1989 5.0 Mustang and I have it done to the Tees! every time I step into it it relaxes me and to see this movie makes me appreciate it even more. This movie is not about racing it's about a love for a great gift .the gift to make a great car fell like part of the family",merlin6-2,2009-04-04,2009
42,8.0,"Not a bad entry, way better than 2 Fast 2 Furious","Okay, I love this series. It has good looking, along with fast cars, decent performances, and interesting back stories. Fast and Furious is sort of a mix between the last three entries, and that is where this one will either make or lose an audience.The past three were about showing off both tuner and muscle cars while putting them in some very cool situations. The first two were about plain drag and street racing, while Tokyo Drift was about drifting with a couple of street races thrown in for good measure. This one again mixes all three together. In one showcase scene, four racers are scrambling to make it to be the first across the finish line about five miles down the road. They are racing past, into, and around oncoming traffic using street racing and drifting tactics. However, my only gripe about the cars is that they don't seem to be top focus here. Don't get me wrong, Dom's Charger and Bryan trademark car from 2F2F, the Skyline, is back, along with some other cool automotive toys, but aren't used to the effect of the first three.Where this movie shines is in it's presentation. This Fast and Furious is focused on and has, wait for it, a good story fueling (excuse the bad pun) this entry. While nowhere near Oscar or the Academy Awards material, this is fan service to every extent of the meaning. Jordana Brewster, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Vin Diesel, and even Sung Kang (as Han), return for this movie, along with giving decent performances While definitely continuing the story of the first, I didn't hear any references to the events of 2F2F. I'm wondering if they know themselves that that one was a mistake? BTW, this story takes place between 2F2F and Tokyo Drift, if Han returning wasn't any indication.Overall, fans of the series should like this one, and ranks right up there with the first and Tokyo Drift. If you are not a fan, don't go in thinking this movie is going to be revolutionary or extraordinary, like critics. Instead, just think about having fun watching an action packed thrill-ride that is about two hours long.",codehorizon,2009-04-05,2009
43,1.0,Awful!,"‘The Fast and the Furious’ was bad. ‘2 Fast, 2 Furious’ was even worse. ‘The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift’ was terrible. And now, ‘Fast and Furious’ is complete crap! ‘The Fast and the Furious’ series if the worst movie franchise in the entire history of movie franchises. Whoever produces those movies should really stop and re-think his worthless life of producing the most crappy movies of all time. Along with spoofs and horror films, ‘The Fast and the Furious’ series is one of the many genres/series that are absolutely terrible nowadays. A straight shooter with one out of ten written all over it. I f I could, I would give it one out of one hundred. Unfortunately, I can't do that. So, one out of ten.",sucks-9,2009-04-05,2009
44,7.0,a great addition to the nothing special genre,"Brian O'Conner is now a federal agent (?) and drawn back into his past when he's unexpectedly reunited with former prey Dominic Toretto (Diesel) while in pursuit of an infamous drug smuggler, the very same smuggler with whom Toretto has his very own personal score to settle. Despite the circumstances, and their prior history, the two reluctantly decide to work together to bring the lowlife down. Silly, clichéd sequel has the expected high-octane action sequences, but suffers from shallow characters, crummy dialogue, weak acting, and a ridiculous story. The reunion of stars Diesel and Walker who kick-started the franchise adds no flare whatsoever to the tepid proceedings, but undiscriminating action fans may not mind. *½",Special-K88,2009-04-05,2009
45,9.0,Return to be Fast & Furious,"Great to see the four main cast members return for Fast & Furious which has Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto,Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner, Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto and Michelle Rodriguez as Letty. Great to see the series go back to the way it started to bring fans of cars to come see a awesome movie series since The Fast And The Furious came to the box offices in 2001. I have seen all the Fast And The Furious movie and this throw The third movie in the series out the window. The action and cars in Fast & Furious are much improve and kick butt beyond that. The Story has more twist and turns then the others, Dominic is out for revenge and later by a now back in the F.B.I. Brain joins in undercover while trying to rebuild a old love with Mia who he loved in The Fast and the Furious. I like that the writers set up the story so well and make it where you never knew what happens next it just that good. All the cars are awesome from all kinds of Car companies such as GM, FORD, HONDA, TOYOTA, DODGE, and so forth. They really took the Furious and put it into Fast & Furious. If you have not seen this movie yet you must see it it helps rebuild the series and I hope we get another Fast & Furious movie soon enough because this movie helps the movie survive I give Fast & Furious a 9 out of ten A lot has chance, You're right",Terryfan,2009-04-05,2009

I think if you're fan of Fast and the Furious you will not be disappointed at all!

47,8.0,Strong sequel in a great movie series!,"Fast & Furious shows originality far beyond it's title, enough to put it on top of the series with the first. 2F2F was a decent sequel, but definitely was not an ending point. TD was funny, entertaining, and gripping, but once again was not a good ending point for the series. F&F was a GREAT addition to the series. Enough girls, plenty of fast cars, some good one-liners, good action, awesome driving, great stunts, and an awesome cast. This one had more than enough badass-ery to satisfy me. Overall, I went in expecting something like TD, but came out amazed. Any fan of the series will absolutely love F&F! Some gripes: 1) I was disappointed Han didn't have more of a role, I really liked his style in Tokyo Drift. 2) The GPS-Nav thing added nothing to the movie, it was just some stupid Hollywood cheese that had wayyy too much of a part in the movie. 3) During the race-in, Brian was driving parallel to Dom on the dirt road, then at the end of the road he drove down the embankment to catch up with Dom.... WTF?!??!?! That was a PRIME moment to do an epic jump. 4) I thought Lil Wayne had a cameo.....",Bigbadboy701,2009-04-05,2009
48,6.0,Too serious.......,"I got a chance to see the new ""Fast & Furious"" movie this weekend. I gotta say I was expecting a huge blockbuster movie filled with fun and action much like its predecessors. Unfortunately I may have set the bar too high as I was thoroughly disappointed. I have been a huge fan of the ""Fast & Furious"" series for years as they are great for the purpose they were made for: To entertain. I felt that this newest installment took it self a bit too seriously and that it could have used a lot more ""fun"". The feel of the movie was a bit awkward as the cast has not worked together in almost 8 years. It was as if they were uncomfortable coming together again. What I also did not understand is where part 2 fit into this whole equation. It was as if the producers dusted off part 2 as if it never existed. I did like how they linked this movie to part 3(Tokyo Drift) however, as it is my favorite in the series. Overall I would have to give this movie a 6/10. It would probably be lower if I was not a fan of the series and actually cared to see what has happened with it's characters.",xjeffreyxnothing-1,2009-04-06,2009
49,8.0,Thank You,"The Fast and the Furious: I liked it, first of its kind.2 Fast 2 Furious: Good sequel with Paul and Tyrese but no Vin and it was not the direct sequel that carried on from the first.Tokyo Drift: Was the unwanted third instalment that had Bow Wow and took place in densely populated Tokyo which frankly is not the place for an American action film. Fast and Furious: That should have been in Tokyo drifts spot. I find it the best in the series. The story is stronger, the whips have much more torque, the girls are freakier and they managed to get the location right this time.This was the sequel that really tore it up.",arnieiam,2009-04-06,2009

Paul Waler is a good actor. However Paul always play in b movies. Maybe, Paul should do b horror movies for a career change. If one includes Walkers acting and the stunts The Fast and Furious, is it four or five, is entertaining. My wife like the movie. However I found the movie just OK; A movie rental night film. I give The Fast and the Furious a six out of ten. I hope the producers of The Fast and the Furious do not make a part six or seven. Enough already.",mm-39,2009-04-06,2009
51,6.0,Entertaining,"There is no doubt that the first half of the film is the best of the movie which involve 2 great action sequences, one at the beginning in the highway that one could watch a small part in the movie's trailer and the other it's a race at night in the city's streets in the middle of the traffic, after the latter sequence the movie diminish a lot in its quality until the end. I think this film deserves 6.5 stars, even though I have to say that it was much better of what I expected.Dominic and Brian meet again and join forces, the first one to get revenge for losing a very close person and the other to catch the boss of a drug mafia ......6.5 stars = regular +",butchfilms,2009-04-06,2009

But on the other side, for all of you who are a fans of the series: this is a must see, because everything that makes you like this movie is in it. Fast cars, trusted characters and needless to say, a lot of action. The plot isn't the strongest aspect of this film, neither is the level of acting. But I get the feeling the creators of the movie didn't want it to be strong, compelling, innovating or confronting. 'Just sit back and enjoy the ride'. And if you let the movie take control of you, it will be a crazy one.Me, being a fan of the series, liked this movie a lot. Therefore I give it a 7/10.

If you remember the last of Tokyo Drift, and what was said - you'll understand.The only thing I found wrong with the movie was one big blooper at the very end of the show - when you watch Fast and Furious, you'll clearly see what I mean.This movie offers a lot of America muscle with import, and I wouldn't be surprised if a video game comes out. Vin is back 100%, just as you remember him from the beginning of his career. Like in the other shows, many beautiful cars get destroyed.",thanna-1,2009-04-06,2009
54,5.0,Fasten your seatbelts.,"The latest installment in the high-energy Fast and Furious brings back the original cast to the franchise that made them stars. The result - the strategy paid off, this outing is the best of the sequels, and I find myself wondering whether this is the best F&F movie. It's a good, VERY solid, no-holds-barred action movie.While the plot may be a slight rehash of 2 Fast 2 Furious, it's (mostly) the cars who steal the scene here. Like most of it's predecessors, the cars move through busy streets and off-roads like a hip-hop dancer. Let the cars do the talking, I say. The producers thought it would be a good idea to bring Justin Lin back on board as director after Tokyo Drift, up until now the most carefully shot of the franchise. Well, his kinetic and lively direction paid off, and he's an action director to look out in the future. The cinematography is wide in scope and the editing rarely at times feels rushed and pulls you into the film without force. The music from Brian Tyler (again from Tokyo Drift), also fits the moments. There is a number of action sequences, and while some may find the number of actual illegal street races little (one, in fact) disappointing, fear not, as the other action scenes with cars in them more than make up for it, especially the final action sequences. There are obvious moments of CGI, though, but Lin and his crew pull it off in a way it makes it enjoyable.Most of the actors, for most of the time, do NOT out-act the cars. In fact one returning star's character is underused and another's wasted. But the two REAL leads steal the show (barely) from the automobiles, namely Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto. Since he's producer as well, he makes sure when the cameras are on him, they show his X-factor potential to the fullest. What made Diesel into a bankable action hero is proved here, he has a tough body, a macho voice, and a charming personality to boot. This, is his TRUE comeback to mainstream action after the laughably inept Babylon A.D. Fans of Diesel would be glad to know he's back kicking a lot of ass in the film. It's almost ""The Vin Diesel Kicks Ass Show"". The other actor almost stealing the limelight is Paul Walker, the other lead, who seems to be more aggressive in his role as Brian O' Connor. Who could blame him? The first F&F was meant to make him into a bona-fide star, Vin Diesel stole the limelight from him. This is evident in his post F&F movies (Running Scared (2006), anyone?). Anyway having Vin & Paul back together makes all the difference, as they portray characters in which anyone can root for.So for a fast paced, popcorn munching good time, , buckle up and hang on for a Universal thrill ride. What the story lacks, it more than makes up with it's cast, it's action, and most importantly, it's cars. Girls, cars, and bling, oh my! It's the best of the sequels, and it may be the best in the series.Entertainment value: 9/10Overall: 6.5/10",dvc5159,2009-04-07,2009
55,10.0,a total trip,"I have seen all the previous movies, and I absolutely loved the first movie. I admit it, I really wanted to be able to drive like that. I watched the two sequels, only too fast too furious stuck out due to the good music. Tokyo drift just didn't cut it, it wasn't ""fast and furious"" by any standard. it was nice to see that most of the original cast was back, they seemed to be right back in the roles that i had come to love in the original! my roommate and i went to the theater with very anxiously, even though we had both seen the trailers. the opening bit was AMAZING!!! i was literally sitting on the edge of my seat. both my roommate and I were so wrapped up in the movie we were dancing to the beats while still sitting! despite our apprehensions going into the movie we walked out with our minds blown! it was that good. the cars, the men, the driving, the little bit of romance and the awesome ramming scene.if you ever were looking for a good time, even if only for 2 hours, this is your ticket. great movie, go see it!! 10 out of 10!!",beccakwalsh13,2009-04-07,2009
56,4.0,Disappointing,"I'm sorry but this film was a huge let down... The plot was lacking and not very original (catch a drug cartel guy...again). It was great seeing Vin Deisel back in the movie but overall the movie was missing the biggest thing that these movies are about, COOL CARS!! The only decent cars in the entire movie are the ones that Dom's sister drives, Dom's dad's car and one that is is shown driven twice my a supporting actor. I feel they went the completely wrong direction with this movie and forgot about what we all go to see Fast & the Furious films for, sick cars and action packed racing. Hopefully they will come out with another one when they have remembered what the movies became famous for. I would not recommend paying to see this in theaters, this is definitely one to rent when it comes out on video and only if you feel like spending a few bucks to see the Vin Deisel/ Paul Walker combination back in action.",RockyReed,2009-04-08,2009
57,4.0,Lives Up To Its Name,"If your taste in film runs to car chases and blood than Fast & Furious will more than live up to its title. The special effects do somewhat make up for a story that had its origins in another film with the same protagonists in 2001. I suppose you will have to have seen that film to understand what's going on here.Vin Diesel as a career criminal and Paul Walker as the LAPD officer working with the FBI to nail Diesel are back again, picking up where they left off. Some really bad blood happened as Walker in the previous film got intimate with Diesel's sister Jordana Brewster. Now however both are after the same man, a criminal kingpin of mysterious origins who has killed Diesel's sister, Michelle Rodriguez.They both go undercover so to speak each not giving the other's game away. These facts are divulged in those precious few moments between car chases, fights, and shootings which come in abundance.Nothing terribly new here, but the ending is absolutely ludicrous, no way Paul Walker trashes his whole career for what he does.",bkoganbing,2009-04-08,2009
58,3.0,Definitely Disappointing,"Well, where to begin.... As it might have occurred to you that after seeing a movie you head straight to the toilet in the theatre where people are gathering and waiting in lines, exchanging thoughts about the movie. Actually this time the line was quite long and everybody kept saying the same things. Why do studios always have to make a bad sequel to a great movie (FNF 1)? They wanted to get paid again and again and again? Well, this time the story is over because nobody will want to see the next sequel. I always say to my friends that i can write a better script than this while i am in the bathroom for 5 minutes, and yes, with a cast like this the story should have been MUCH MORE enjoyable, action packed, where the director does not let you breathe (like in the first FNF). Come on, this movie is about cars, the director did not have the first idea about new models (okay, there was one), but that's not even the point. The story should have been! And the characters should have been! Emotions should have been! The movie is all about grief from the beginning, which does not pay well in my opinion. The audience left the theatre without the adrenalin they have paid for, unsatisfied. And in this dangerous financial times it is a huge mistake! The movie has grossed a lot, okay. Because people want to see it with their own eyes that the movie which was great once, went down the gutter, otherwise they won't believe it. Go ahead and watch it, just for the sake of disappointment. If anyone is sorry, I am, believe me.",jammyn,2009-04-08,2009
59,5.0,Disappointing,"I expected big things from this movie, especially with the poster showing all the original movie cast and the exciting trailer. But disappointing is the exact word that describes this movie for me.The story has never been a strong point of the Fast & the Furious series. Well, neither is the acting for that matter. What is most important is the good amount of orgasmic cars and adrenaline pumping racing on show! But the director probably thought they'd try and give the series a new look. Bad idea.Here's why. The story, if you look closely enough, is littered with loopholes and while that is generally overlooked in a F&F movie, it can't be when it is being given a lot of importance. Vin Diesel probably has just two expressions in his repertoire, and he used them to the fullest in this movie, especially when he was in the emotional scenes.Coming to the action. This is where a F&F movie redeems itself. But sadly there is only ONE proper race in this movie, and 3 other action sequences with cars. Which is disappointing to say the least! When people think about this series, its all about the cars and the racing. But apparently it wasn't for this movie. Even Paul Walker's good guy-tough cop routine couldn't save this movie.I'm a big fan of the series, and if this movie wouldn't have had the cast, then I would have rated it below Tokyo Drift. But it manages JUST enough to better the previous installment. If this would have been some other movie and not a F&F sequel, I probably would have rated it higher. But since it is, I give it 5/10.",sahil-ganguly,2009-04-08,2009
60,7.0,Hollywood Trademark,"As expected from a Hollywood movie in general and the makers of The and Furious in particular this time, the ""bad guy"" is traditionally a perfect Christian ... bravo Hollywood, NEVER miss an opportunity to insult a religion especially one that is defenseless in the Media of the USA, Canada, most of Europe ........ , imagine if they made the ""BAD GUY"" a Muslim or if they committed the ultimate Hollywood blasphemy of making him a good Zionist Jew, what would the Media have done with the makers, probably lead to a ban of the movie, IF it had not been killed in production the Hollywood likes of those movies are countless if you should really look, not just 1 or 2. And to the people who were trained to think that I'm a racist and Anti-Semite etc ... , I tell them that a my Jewish friends agree with me , as for myself, I'm a Semite, and NO, NOT ALL SEMITES ARE JEWS Islamic Terrorists have more respect for other people's religions than Hollywood Terrorists, and that you are receiving from someone LIVING in the middle east , not watching it through finely filtered news, WAKE UP !!!",tskyhopper,2009-04-09,2009
61,9.0,FF 2.5 - the best in the series.,"Though I was extremely excited about this movie coming out, I honestly it would be somewhat disappointing. But I was very surprised. I absolutely loved how they integrated things from the first movie into it; the old house, the old car, even Dom's cross and leather jacket. It basically brought in things from the first and third movie which is great because the second one was crap, in my opinion. This movie was a lot more emotional and serious compared to the others. Vin Diesel did a fantastic job playing the broken-hearted hero with the tough macho exterior. You could really feel his pain. It was better, I think, than his character in 'A Man Apart' in which he was also seeking revenge. I would have really liked to see more of Michelle Rodriguez, though, just so the four main characters could actually be reunited again. And it would have been nice to see more of Sung Kang. He was basically in it for five minutes, said something about Tokyo and then he was gone. They should have delved more into the history that was touched on in Tokyo Drift. The cars used in this one were also great. But like I said before, it feels like this sequel was more concerned with the plot and emotions involved rather than just the action - not to say that the action sequences didn't make me jump a little. The only thing I would complain about is the ending. It was a nice concept because it echoed the beginning, but it left me with the feeling that nothing was solved in the movie because it put them all right back where they started. Overall: great plot, explosive action, hot boys and hot cars - I give this movie 9 out of 10. :)",n_retandy,2009-04-09,2009

63,5.0,a movie as a video-game - or is it the other way around?,"The latest installment in the Fast & Furious saga (instead of giving it a tune-up in terms of a different title, after 2 Fast & 2 Furious and Tokyo Drift, they just removed the ""The"" words to possibly fool certain viewers), starring again Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, functions fairly competently enough as a car chase and/or car driving picture. That it never involved me in terms of its story or characters could be another matter, but it isn't. It's precisely why this movie, for all of its money and care and sense of ""hey, 13 year old boys will go APE over this"", it's got nothing at all that one would not see in a video game.While I might have thought this could have been a deterrent to its box-office potential it is about to cross the 100 million mark with still more to go. And yet I wonder if I am the only one who, within the first sequence if not a little longer into it, could think ""yeah, didn't I just see this in, oh, any given Grand Theft Auto video game""? And the fact is a Grand Theft Auto game is what this movie is: drug dealers, gangsters, super-slick driving with the occasional guiding voice coupled with dialog that in a video game one would just click ahead to go past. Whatever little plot and character development there was in the first film, which certainly had more fun with itself, is given the pits here.For anyone who's had the pleasure of a GTA experience (the best of them, I mean, not the first one which didn't have nearly the fun of III or Vice City) one can ride cars as fast as possible and even let the Id out as much as wanted - you get star ratings for your wanted level, and mission be damned, just have a good time. The failure of Fast & Furious is that for any moment I could try to get into it as entertainment it pulled back into video game territory, and in a millisecond realize the lack of a controller to take over. It's synthetic entertainment ala Transformers, and while Justin Lin is not the caliber of BOOM-EXPLOSIONS ARE SO COOL! filmmaker like Michael Bay he's lost any sense of real interest in what makes a story work well - sad considering his first film, Better Luck Tomorrow, and the underrated Finishing the Game, did very much just that.If you're a hardcore fan of the franchise- and frankly I never met one and am not sure even the ones in the audience were- you'll dig it a lot. For everyone else, stick to the video-games.",Quinoa1984,2009-04-09,2009
64,6.0,Same old but slightly enhanced formula.,"Fast & Furious, the fourth in line of the Fast and the Furious franchise, uses the same old formula that makes the first three movies good and then trimmed off the little things that make them bad.The story kicks off with the return of some familiar faces, namely, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his band of brothers – and girlfriend, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) – in an attempt to steal some petrol, in which they succeed. But Dom is a wanted man. And being an honorable wanted man that he is, he left his friends in hope that the cops would come for him instead of them. Skip a few years later, Dom gets a call from his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) telling him that his beloved girlfriend is murdered. And that is generally the plot of this movie: Dom's out to find the person responsible for Letty's death.And then in come another familiar face, the undercover cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), in a very fast and adrenaline-rushed chase scene. That is, on foot and from rooftop to rooftop. That is one of the most exciting scenes in the movie.Brian is on a hunt for a drug-dealer, who is actually the same guy that Dom is trying to find. So they teamed up... just like old times.Fast & Furious is really for fans only. New-comers might not understand the connection between the characters, but the story itself is quite easy to follow, with some surprising twist in the plot.But it was a disappointment to see that some of the action sequences are done in CGI, namely the tunnel scenes. This really takes away the excitement that the first three movies offer. And also, this movie is way too serious. Instead of the cars and races, we're focused on Dom's quest for revenge which could be a drag after a while.If you just let go of the bad dialogues and some plot holes, and probably the lack of action, Fast & Furious is actually not bad. It's still fast and still furious, and with a more matured storyline.But if they're planning for a sequel, I suggest that they get back to the original theme of the franchise, which is racing and cars.",SophomoreSlump,2009-04-09,2009

I don't see anyone of the things he wrote anywhere in the movie, the story isn't hard to figure out, it's a revenge flic. The story was extremely action packed, and didn't stop for a second. If the review guy is into realistic movies with a small amount of action, I suggest he go review some documentaries, try Gran Tornio if you want a ""realistic"" movie. That review was the worst I've ever read, I don't get why he even comments on the lady halfway through the movie's nipples, I guess he was trying to make his review lengthy to make it look readable, regardless of how pathetic it was.",berter122,2009-04-09,2009
66,3.0,The first one BORING!,"Even the atrocious Tokyo Drift wasn't boring, it was just bad at everything, insulting even, but not boring. This one tried to have a more complex plot/story, with character development and emotive scenes, but without better actors and written dialogue and without sacrificing any second of ‘car scenes’. It failed. Some of the things kind of worked out: -Toretto solidifies himself as a ‘sensitive good’ criminal with a good arc in the movie, (even if probably a bit forced) -Brian finally goes full on criminal -The plot exists and is dense. There are plenty interconnected subplots that end up in a coherent way. But getting those things right, only provoked bigger problems: -A more complex plot required a lot of boring scenes filled with exposition. -A more complex plot showcased how unbelievable the whole thing is. The FBI in particular felt impossibly fake -A more complex and emotional plot required more acting from Paul Walker and Vin Diesel, and they are just terrible actors. -A more complex plot without any realism and depth and overall point (no social commentary, no ideology, no political discussion) gets boring and takes away minutes and chances for more comedic scenes (more appropriate for this franchise)",educallejero,2019-03-24,2019
67,4.0,Best in the series so far,"I found that the fourth part was more mature then the ones before. You had the usual racing, no-logic, Little Story, women who willingly offer themselves to anybody and the original cast. But thought it wasn't so dump and flat this time. The actors even... acted from time to time. I liked Vin Diesel very much here. The idea of Brian of beeing a cop and beeing a criminal annoyed me very much. As if no one really had to pay for the crimes they have commited. Well Dom seemed to get like 25 years in prison at the end, which shook me a lot as it ended so abruptly. Sure the Boys and one Girl where about to save him from that... Again the message here: Laws are for the usual People and with a fast car you can just escape?",lythis-love,2019-04-18,2019
68,7.0,Brilliant film.,It's say Brian is back working for the FBI and the movie he does but in the first movie he worked undercover for the LAPD. And what gets me is when they blame Brian when it was the FBI Agent Stasaik. That gave the go order to arrest Braga/Campos.,wesgunton,2019-04-22,2019
69,1.0,Annoying camera shake...,"Every time there is a fight scene, car chase or action sequence the camera shakes around all over the place and you can't see what's happening.

70,7.0,feels like we're back home,"Beastly movie. Awesome action, great racing scenes, good story. Lots of creative ways to improve on the racing parts. Hate-able villains. So many awesome intense scenes and omg moments. Was pretty deep like the original movie with some good emotional moments and character relationships. Even small things reminded me that we're back in the world created by the original, like dinner with family with a nice song playing, or mia yelling ""dom stop!"" lolit has lots of flaws but this movie is a great time. It brought the series back to where it needed to be. It captured the feel of the first movie. And i wonder if it gave them the confidence to go all in on fast 5 and subsequent movie-films (random borat reference lol) (4 viewings, 6/18/2021)",FeastMode,2019-06-24,2019
71,6.0,Fun but familiar,"Once again, it follows the same plot points as some of the previous installments but Fast and Furious is still fun and its beginning to embrace the ridiculousness. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker give great performances and it's nice to see them back in the same film. John Ortiz is a really good villain. The action and car chases are also really good as usual.",masonsaul,2019-07-25,2019
72,8.0,Fast and furious,"Fast & Furious (2009) is an awesome Action packed sequel, where The Fast and the Furious (2001) stopped. This is the real sequel to The Fast and The Furious. I love that Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster reprise their roles back to the roots the way they were. This is my fourth favorite best film in the series, this film Is a seat to the edge from the beginning till the end. This movie kept me thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. Sure it's a little far fetched, but who cares?It's a movie, and definitely not as bad as some people are saying. Besides, the point of watching a movie is to escape reality so I don't understand why people complain when movies are not realistic. Provided a cinematic equivalent of NOS to the franchise with a tone shift that helped make it one of the most popular and profitable action series in the last decade. Excellent flick. Much better than the middle two. Just forget those movies happened. This was good balls to the walls action with much better actors with the original 4 back together. Bad idea making 2 and 3 :)Vin Diesel and Paul Walker re team with Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster for the ultimate chapter of the franchise built on speed! When fugitive Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) returns to Los Angeles to avenge a loved one's death, it reignites his feud with agent Brian O'Conner (Walker). But, as they race through crowded city streets and across international lines, they must test their loyalties by joining together to bring down a shared enemy. From big rig heists to precision tunnel crawls, Fast & Furious takes you back into the high-octane world, which lives for speed, drives for the rush and breaks all the rules!""Maybe you're the bad guy pretending to be the good guy.""This film is more about stopping a notorious drug lord Arturo Braga and avenging the murder of Letty (Michelle Rodriguez). This film is set back in Los Angles when everything started, after 5.years of leaving the city of Angeles for Dominican Republic after Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew become a Wanted Fugitives. Letty was murdered when she was mixed up in a drug racers mule cartel. She knew the people who hired her, will double crossed her, while trying to escape the flying bullets she was killed by a drug lord's henchman. That weary angrier Dom (Vin Diesel) brings him back to Los Angeles, to avenge his loved one's death and tracking down Drug Lord Braga and killing him. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), is now an FBI agent, and he is assigned to track down a notorious drug lord named Arturo Braga. Both men faces each other in a final showdown. Braga is looking for a fast drivers that are driving and smuggling trough desert New Mexico drugs. Brian goes again undercover only to find out that he and Dom (Vin Diesel) are been double crossed and set up on the same way that was Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) was.This film is filled with full action, fast cars, full of stunts and beautiful women. Gal Gadot is tremendous as Gisele Harabo it was her first role in this film and she was awesome, she acted the character terrific. Paul walker was the best in this film, finally, finally they did something with the character, he become an FBI Agent which I love that with the character In this movie. I love that Dom (Vin Diesel) at the end of the film didn't run, he surrender and I love how Brian ( Paul Walker) was testifying for him in the court. Seriously this film Kicks ass, although I prefer Fast Five over this Action Flick, but that doesn't mean this film did not do the job right, it did! And this film is highly underrated and criticized by critics. Also Han (Sung Kang) has a small scene in the beginning of this film, that was before they killed the beloved character in The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006).The rating I am giving to this film is 9. Anything below 7 would be ridiculous, if anyone would not say that this wasn't At least A GOOD ACTION FILM! (it is sure as hell",dineshaishu,2019-07-28,2019
73,6.0,Definately Better Than The Second Film,"Fast and Furious is, in my opinion one of the high points of the early Fast films. I could enjoy Fast and the Furious for what it was. 2 Fast 2 Furious I could not really get into despite the awesome races. Fast and Furious is where I started to like and get into the franchise. There are many reasons for why this is.I find the characters to be better this time around. Vin Diesel's character, Toretto, is back with a vengeance. Him being back, and his character arc in this is one of the main reasons I like this film more than the previous ones. I am also a fan of revenge stories, which made me enjoy this more.I like Paul Walker's character, Brian, more here than any of the previous films. He seems more mature and professional here. In this film he has been reinstated as an FBI agent. I still do not really buy him as an FBI agent; he does come off as more professional and less of a punk in this movie.Jordana Brewster, from the first film, comes back as Mia, who is Brian's love interest. I thought she was fine, but she is not given much to do. The other characters are not much.The villain is also very lazy. The Fast films have never had strong villains, but I find this one particularly weak. The villain in this movie along with the villain in the first film is probably my least favorite villains of these movies.The races are still fun to watch. The races here are probably some of my favorite of the franchise. Although there is some very obvious CGI used in some of the races and car chases which might take you out. There was CGI used in the previous films as well, but here it is particularly noticeable. The CG did irk me, but it did not ruin the action.Overall, Fast and Furious is my second favorite Fast film so far. I definitely like it more than the films before it. I like the darker tone, as well as Vin Diesel and his character arc. The races were also good despite the noticeable CGI. For those who are fans of this franchise give this a look if you have not already.",mitchell5954,2019-08-16,2019

76,4.0,Fast & Furious (2009),"Directed by Justin Lin. Starring Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, John Ortiz, Gal Gadot, Jack Conley, Shea Whigham, Michelle Rodriguez, Liza Lapira, Laz Alonso, Sung Kang, Tego Calderón, Don Omar. (PG-13)After sitting out a sequel or two, Diesel and Walker are re-teamed as hunk-of-clay Dominic Toretto and scratchy-wooden-plank Brian O'Conner (call 'em Argil n' Poplar!), both out for justice/vengeance against a vaguely nefarious Mexican drug lord. The series was running on fumes by the time they ""got the old gang back together,"" but the production team knew how to craft a loud, sleek machine of populist stupidity, full of fast cars, barely-concealed backsides, substandard CGI, and lots of gravelly proclamations about family, loyalty, and chumps being busters. You get what you expect, but the high-octane chases being reduced to ones-and-zeroes so often is disappointing, as is an instantly forgettable villain who's less threatening than a Geico agent holding insurance claims on all the wrecked candy-colored imports. Not the worst the franchise had to offer, but its technique is more competent than supercharged, and in hindsight, it acted as little more than a transition between the street-racing outlaw dopiness of the previous films and the gargantuan heist/superspy outings to come.43/100",fntstcplnt,2019-09-18,2019

80,6.0,Awful and good at the same time...,"I've re watched this movie with adult eyes and this movie is pretty awful in every regard. When it came out in 2009, it was the best thing ever! It was an ode to the kids of car culture. We all wanted Skylines and neon glows after watching this. This was our first taste of the culture. The action is like watching a video game and the acting is pretty poor, but eh.. the cars go fast and the girls are cute.If you've never seen it, sit down and check it out.. there are worse ways to spend 2 hours.",Truth_Cuts,2020-02-02,2020
81,6.0,Fast & Furious,"Vin Diesel and Paul Walker return to the franchise for the fourth entry after the series' diversion to Tokyo for episode 3. It obviously feels more like an F&F movie with these two in the driver's seats, and director Justin Lin knows exactly what is expected of him as he fills the screen with muscle cars engaged in hair-raising races, macho posturing and hot chicks in hot pants (one of whom is future Wonder Woman Gal Gadot). There's nothing groundbreaking about Fast & Furious, but it delivers everything that is required of it.",JoeytheBrit,2020-04-14,2020
82,7.0,"Action, Excitement, Mystery","The Fast and the Furious series movies always continue with more excitement and action than the previous movie. The first scene of the film, as usual, appears before the audience with the peak of action and tension. The action of the first scenes allows the audience to lock on the screen throughout the movie. The movie feeds the audience to action. Dom's coming back in series 4 gives the audience what he wants, but what happened to Letty is disappointing to the audience.Adding a mystery about Braga to the movie has also contributed greatly to the audience watching the movie with curious looks.There is nothing to say to the cars, they are all very good, very fast and beautifully modified.But this movie is also overshadowed by erotic scenes like the first movie of the series. Especially the kissing scene of two girls does not like people at all. I wish they shoot the movies without adding the erotic scenes into the script.",drmuhammedsamiduru,2020-04-20,2020
83,5.0,Return of the original cast,This film starts pulling together all the parts of the series that worked. The spin-offs had been somewhat successful but they lacked the core strength of Diesel and Walker being together. Walker has grown into his role over time and the improved dialogue allows for less cringe worthy exchanges. The plot is still generic and is only a slight improvement over number 2. Disappointing plot undermines what should've of a slam dunk. The revenge plot is new for the series and from this moment on the storylines grow even more insane.,nicholls905-280-546911,2020-04-23,2020
84,7.0,Tunnel vision across underground jurisdictions infiltration of a truth of enemy creating bonds of knowledge,"In this one. Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, Paul Walker as Brian O'Connor, Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto and Michelle Rodriguez as Leticia ''Letty'' Ortiz. The film also introduces new characters Fenix (Laz Alonso), Omar (Don Omar), Leo Tego (Tego Calderon), Cara Mirtha (Mirtha Michelle) and Campos (John Ortiz). Sung Kang who played Han Seoul-Oh in Tokyo Drift has also made a appearance. We can briefly say that this is the direct sequel to the 2001 film. It begins from where it ended. Brian is at it again he a cop not cop now cop trying tobring down a heroin importer by infiltrating his operation. Director:Justin Lin has done a better thriller We start in Honduras were dom is doing his business robbing a oil tanker with letti But thing go explosive bad So with Brian on the hunt and sniffing round he comes in contact with dom So when Brian gets wind of a job he goes on a hunch to a party finding clues As dom also has grief on his mind he is also on the hunt for a killer but his has him and Brian unite for shared enemy and they are forced to bring him down any way necessary so with La race on the cards for to get a job the two work on a plan even though they don't trust each other so not give away who each other is. Gal gadot this is her first film her character Giselle is a henchwomen for bragga And with honour at stake their is a race but this part is like video game as its goes kind GPS virtual race Bragga his gang try and manipulate certain situations to stay ahead The film focuses mostly on swag, sex appeal, action, hunt and most importantly on the American Muscle cars. Why the film holds my attention is because the film promises on what is says in it's title: Fast & Furious. It's definitely more fast and more furious than the original one. Los Angeles and floors through the Mexican desert. When a crime brings them back to L.A., fugitive ex-con Dom Toretto reignites his feud with agent Brian, Dom and Brian must give in to an uncertain new trust if they hope to outmaneuver him. And from convoy heists to precision stealth tunnels crawls across international lines with close contact racing accidents , two men will find the best way to get revenge: push the their limits and cars they have What a film from start to finish this is the making of the this film series you don't get many film getting better as they get older but this made but my on the seat for every other fast film enjoy the film because I did and the cars I listed out this film rating as you see is 7 and its rating is going up for the rest The Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 that O'Connor 1964 Chevrolet Impala 1769. 1967 Chevrolet C-Series. 1969 Chevrolet Camaro Z28. 1969 Dodge Coronet. 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS. 1970 Dodge Charger. 1970 Plymouth Road Runner. 1971 Cadillac Sedan DeVille.",lark40,2020-05-04,2020
85,6.0,Return of the dream team,"Paul Walker and Vin Diesel reunite in this continuation of the Fast & Furious franchise. Dominic and his crew are on the run from the law, while O'Conner has returned back to FBI. But then Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is killed and nothing will ever be the same as both Dominic and Brian seek solace for past sins.The film works mostly for the same reasons the previous films did. It's oozing with style, has very charismatic actors playing characters they were born to play, has very fast and cool cars, features a killer sound track, and is just all around fun to watch.I'd still say the original 2001 film is better, although not by much. It simply had rawer edge to it and had novelty on its side.Still, I very much enjoyed this film. Gal Gadot was a blast as a henchwoman to a drug boss, the car scenes were a ton of fun and the plot was kept well together. Plus, this film was the first step towards a grander scope when it comes to these movies.

Some of the scenes drag a bit to me but for the most part it's interesting. The third act is pretty good with the tunnels is pretty cool. The films villain isn't bad as well but definitely isn't the best in the franchise. Overall I think the fourth outing is a good enough movie with some good action scenes.,twpain,2020-06-05,2020

90,7.0,Not to be confused with The Fast and the Furious,"The 4th installment of the Fast & Furious franchise called Fast & and Furious not to be confused with The Fast and the Furious. Which one of the many dumb things about this movie including it takes place before the previous movie, that Brian O'Connor manages to return to being a cop, and the Brian never gives any reason for choosing a life of crime over one in law enforcement but that he respects Dominic more than himself. Before anything else this movie is a dumb entertaining action movie, but there is remnant of a good story, just remnants. The main characters Brain O'Connor and Dominic Toretto start the movie at odds, but ultimately are buddies and are working toward the same goal, the apprehension of the drug dealer. At its core this movie has a base of a good movie, the apprehension of a drug dealer, Brain's struggle with being the good guy, and Dominic's desire for revenge. The chase for the drug dealer is a good action plot with a twist of who Braga is from my perspective I don't think obvious, and lead to an awesome car chase at the end. This the template for all the action and exciting sequences that you can't complain about. Brain O'Connor is somehow allowed back in the FBI and allowed to work around Dominic Toretto even though he let him go. The whole movie he is working toward the goal of capturing the Braga, who is essentialy the mission, but his desire to help Dominic and Mia greater than any other desire. His motives for these actions don't make any sense, if he really cared about Dom and Mia he would help them have a change of heart. These movies basicly preach that if crime is where your family than crime is OK. Dominic Toretto, a revenge story is pretty standard for any movie, but in this movie there isn't any push back to stop the revenge it also glorifies revenge. Brian and Dominic are very morally gray and they see their actions as good and even pray that God bless their day where they steal $60 million dollars of heroin and hide it. Also Mia is pushing back from Brain for the first half of the movie and all of the sudden they start making out. Though all of this is wrapped around to be positive because I is so easy to pick a part and adds to the already entertaining factor of the movie. The movie includes many awesome car chases, a chase on foot with Paul Walker, explostions, and Vin Diesel rams into the guy who killed his girlfriend with a car. The movie is entertaining, dumb, and stupid.",mvpdom,2020-06-18,2020

92,6.0,Another enjoyable actioner in the franchise.,"Just like the original 'The Fast and the Furious', this film starts off with an impressive truck heist scene - this time a big oil tanker. Although - here - they are pushing reality to the limits.'Fast & Furious' is best viewed as a direct sequel to 2001's 'The Fast and the Furious'. Justin Lin is back in the director's chair. Brian (Paul Walker) is again working for the FBI. Dom (Vin Diesel) and his sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster) are the only original members back for another round. Dom's girlfriend, Letty (Michelle Rodriquez) as well, but only for a very short while. Han (Sung Kang) is in the film's first moments as well, and might seem confusing if you've seen 'Fast and the Furious 3: Tokyo Drift' before this.The film revolves around a drug lord, Braga, who needs racers to transport a shipment of heroin from Mexico to the States. Off course, Dom and Brian are selected, along with a few others. While Brian investigates Braga for the FBI, Dom investigates Letty's murder. There's constant rivalry between Brian and Dom and they're not the friends they were in the original film.'Fast & Furious' is not as easy to follow as 'The Fast and the Furious', but there are a few interesting twists, especially regarding Braga towards the end. There's loads of action and amazing cars. The Mexican desert scene was incredible, as well as the finale with cars racing through an underground tunnel from Mexico to the States.

It's rare that a series of movies finally finds itself in the fourth installment, much less gets that many chances. But here you go - these movies really start becoming beloved right here. Sung Kang shows up as Han Lue, Dominic's right-hand man, bridging the last Japanese side of the franchise, while also introducing Gal Gadot as Gisele Yashar, a liaison for the evil Braga. Laz Alonso also shows up as Fenix Calderon, Braga's right-hand man who murders Letty and sets this whole movie's story arc in motion.

96,6.0,Back to incomprehensibility,"This review contains spoilers. Fast & Furious or Fast & Furious 4 is the fourth installment to The Fast & Furious franchise. The movie is a sequel to The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift but is more of a direct sequel to 2 Fast 2 Furious. The movie features Paul Walker and Vin Diesel as they reprise their roles of Brian O'Conner and Dominic Toretto respectively. The crew from the first movie confront a drug lord called Braga that wrongs both Dominic and Brian. The plot of this movie is incredibly incomprehensible. Many events in the plot simply happen without any reason or the flimsiest of reasoning. This movie's plot is an excuse to show car chases. The story keeps up the action at the expense of the plot. An example of this is in one car race, Brian is knocked out of the race. He is able to use his FBI connections to re-unite with Dominic Toretto by taking another person's place. The other characters and even the villain simply accept this and allow it to happen. The main story of Letty's murder is not well done. This story feels incredibly flimsy and the audience does not even see the murder happen. It is simply in a flashback scene that is told. I understand that the movie wanted to use this event as the reason for Dominic Toretto's mission but it felt incredibly forced. The finale of the movie improves the rest of the movie. With an explosive finale and the story being wrapped up, the movie concludes in a satisfying way. This movie did set up the rest of the series well and this can be considered this installment's strength. I did look forward to the other future installments because of this movie. The movie ends with the crew assembling and busting Dom out of a prison truck. I do not recommend Fast & Furious. This movie's plot is a jumbled mess. The only redeeming factor for this movie is its place for the rest of the series.",anselmdaniel,2020-09-25,2020

105,7.0,"""Ride or die. Remember?"" - Fast & Furious 4 is an action film worth watching, the chemistry between actors and action keeps me coming back","Fast & Furious 4 is the movie in the Fast & Furious franchise that changed my mind on the films, they found their footing and made it an success at the box office. I also believe it's the turning point and I mean how it ventured out of the racing and into heist, crime and action. Not that I'm complaining, it fits the characters and world they have built from the first and second film. F4 is written by Chris Morgan and directed by Justin Lin. It is a direct sequel to The Fast and the Furious whilst being a prequel to Tokyo Drift. The latter whom Justin Lin also directed.The film is again focused on the core characters of Dominic Toretto, Brian O'Conner,
Letty Ortiz, Mia Toretto, Gisele Yashar and Han Lue, whom are portrayed by Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Gal Gadot and Sung Kang. Whilst the villain, Arturo Braga/Ramon Campos is played by John Ortiz. The story goes deeper into the characters and the main theme of family, Gal Gadot and Sung Kang is a great addition to the cast, Sung Kang previously starred in Tokyo Drift which takes place before Fast 7.Earlier in my review I wrote that there were more focus on heist and action. Well F4 is about races and cars too so if you're a fan of that then you'll be excited, there's some very cool cars in this one. The action sequences are bigger and better than ever, higher budget makes that happen. Whilst the action gets better, the logic behind certain things reduces and the characters like Dominic Toretto becomes strong like an ox and able to get shot without even a flinch... Action films like these likes to make it more entertaining than realistic but I won't lie, I still enjoy the movie and will continue to recommend it. Some bad writing and bad acting is alright for a film like this one, Gal Gadot improves immensely though in the next films. The editing is fairly good and so is the pacing, nothing but praise for them on those fronts.",Holt344,2021-06-05,2021
106,2.0,One thing I learned from Dom Nothing Really Matters Unless you have a code,Fast & Furious was not a good movie the acting was awful the story and plot was bad this was the weakest entry in the series.,jasonmichaeldickinson,2021-06-24,2021
107,9.0,Fast & Furious,"This is the best movie of the series so far. It changed the theme from street racing to drug smuggling/revenge. Firstly, I was happy to see the original crew back for the first time since the first movie. It is too bad we had to lose Letty in the first half hour. It ended up working out though because it set up a plot that I thought was good for a Fast and Furious movie. Brian, back working for the FBI, and Dom who is looking to get revenge on Letty's killer both infiltrate a drug smuggler's driving crew. Time passes, the movie gets good, there was a shocking reveal, and some good action. The movie ended with Dom and Brian capturing Braga and trying to get him back to the USA from Mexico to go to prison. There was a daring drive through smuggling tunnels in the border, and Braga eventually getting arrested. The very end of the film had Dom being transferred to a max security prison with Brian, Mia, and Dom's bickering Dominican pals about to break him out of the bus, setting up Fast 5. This was a great movie and I definitely recommend this to everyone. It is very entertaining, but surely they could have named it something else 😂. The name is almost identical to the first movie's title, The Fast and the Furious.",kaden_lewis,2021-07-03,2021
108,3.0,not the best work,"Fast and Furious (2009) is alright. It is not the best movie out of the saga I've seen. Even though it is an action movie, it did not have as much action as before. I don't get why and how Brian is in the FBI. I miss the other characters from the second movie. I also miss the vibe in the first and second movies. Fast and Furious was boring in general.",i_am_momo,2021-07-06,2021
109,8.0,What sequel?,"First of all, this film did two things right: it brought back the original cast and it completely ignored that there ever was a sequel. This has everything I liked about the original, great action, great heart and it was wonderful to have Vin Diesel back in the driver's seat. The logic of the plot was a little fuzzy but overall, I really enjoyed it. I return my rating of the franchise to an 8 (great) out of 10. {Action Drama}",nancyldraper,2021-07-09,2021
110,7.0,Finally!,"After three Fast and the Furious films that were far from enjoyable, I was surprised by how much I was entertained by the fourth installment in the franchise. It was refreshing to see Dom and Brian back together again after years apart. The reunion did not seem forced and there were real moments of conflict between the two of them.The car sequences were fantastic as always and the acting greatly improved over the previous films. While the script was weak and the dialogue had ""I don't like sand"" moments, this is the first entry that I would gladly go back and re-watch.",jace_the_film_guy,2021-07-15,2021

112,4.0,Fast 4: How Are These Still a Thing?,"So, fourth in the franchise and it really makes you wonder how this ever managed to see a 5th film. Yeah, the first one is fun but then you get 3 whiffs in a row and somehow it still got another shot. In the case of this one, it's not bad per say, it's just remarkably underwhelming, perfectly bland and vanilla. We also get a return of some of the wretched CGI that plagued previous films.The only real memorable part of this movie is that Gal Gadot is in there and to see Wonder Woman popping up in one of these flicks is kinda shocking. Really not a good enough reason to check this out though.",questl-18592,2021-08-05,2021

The Film follows Brian O'Conner, back working for the FBI in Los Angeles, teams up with Dominic Toretto to bring down a heroin importer by infiltrating his operation. I found the film to be a decent entry to the F&F Franchise! There's plenty of action, hot babes & st hot cars to get you going! It's great for what it is! At 95mins it's pretty good & before films went wk, this is epic as f!

The screenplay writer deserves a special mention here for the superb screenplay.Acting is great and Vin Diesel and Late Paul Walker had again stole the show with their impeccable acting, Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez were average but effective, John Ortiz was not that effective, rest of the cast were decent. The climax of the film is great and gives a decent closure to the film.Overall an entertaining film with some great stunts.",sauravjoshi85,2021-08-20,2021

120,7.0,The Fast and Furious series:Part 4.,"Going with a friend on the opening weekend to the local Odeon to see the unexpected revival of the Fast franchise,I was shocked by how poor the print was, with the final sequence becoming unwatchable, due to how pitch black/dimmed the colours were on the print. As we left, I did wonder if the image would look better on disc.2021: Recently reading about a friend seeing F9 at the cinema,it gave me the final kick to pick up the Blu-Ray, and return to the 4th round of the Fast saga. View on the film: Becoming the in-house director after this who nailed the style of the series with Fast 5,6 and 9, Justin Lin & cinematographer Amir Mokri signal the change in direction for the franchise with a thrilling opening failed heist set-piece. Moving at high speed, Lin places a emphasis in focusing on practical kitsch-Action dive stunts across vehicles performed by Dom's gang, rather then the speed of the sports cars. Breaking the disagreements between Dom and Brian, Lin drives in on up-close Action, with a hard-hitting punch-up between Brian and Dom, which spins into an exciting final set in tunnels, with Lin using the confined location in tight wide-shots to heighten the time crunch atmosphere of the final chase. Making her film debut, Gal Gadot gives a very good, feisty turn as Gisele, whilst Paul Walker brings a urgency to cop Brian's conflict over which to take, and Vin walks round completely unaware of what type of flick he's in, with his deadly serious performance (never change Vin.) Joined by future Suicide Squad (2016-also reviewed) director David Ayer doing uncredited re-writes, the screenplay by Fast regular Chris Morgan and Ayer changes gears at a crossroads, via the set-pieces in Dom's drive for revenge, (a regular major theme across future entries) being over the top, but treated with a serious tone, rather then kitsch, and surprisingly few mentions of ‘Family’ in the dialogue, which instead drives a building of trust between Brian and Dom as drive away fast & furious.",morrison-dylan-fan,2021-08-29,2021

Go check it out and skip Tokyo drift. You would be wasting your time watching that.",thesterlingweaver,2021-12-30,2021
125,3.0,Very implausible,"This film finally brings us what we were waiting for so much, but it is much less credible than the first ones.In this film the tendency to use the conveniences to get out of the conflict begins, these conveniences end up being implausible and not very credible for the audience, although there is less than in the most recent films of the saga, but even so it does not stop being a resource cheap. The story ends up being boring since it doesn't seem like it's going anywhere or wanting to resolve a conflict, it's just chases or car races, which are even bad due to their horrible editing and mediocre special effects. They introduce new characters but there is no development of them, nor of what happened in the time that has elapsed to the already known characters.Every time the situations that the characters go through and the story to be told are less credible, even the cars go into the background to tell a boring and tedious story.",isaacochoterena,2022-01-03,2022
126,7.0,Nice,"There is a lot of sparkling humor in this series, it can be disassembled all into quotes: ‘Why are you staring at her? - I'm not staring! - Are you one of those who prefers cars to women? - I am one of those who can appreciate the beautiful shapes in any model!’)) Even after such a difficult case, when they had to lick their wounds, when life really hung in the balance, these desperate and reckless guys were also joking: ‘It's time to start robbing banks, less fuss, but more money!’)) The finale of this film is already the beginning of the next one. At first I was afraid that I would not see Vin Diesel on the screen for a long time again, since his character is in a rather delicate position at the end of the 4th ‘Fast and Furious’, he is in uniform and handcuffs ... But with friends like him, nothing is impossible...",kirillchugun,2022-01-18,2022
127,7.0,A return to form for the franchise after losing its way with Tokyo Drift,"Fast & Furious is a solid instalment in the Fast franchise.It benefits from bringing the two best characters in the franchise back together, Vin Diesel's Dom Toretto and Paul Walker's Brian O'Connor.The complicated but blossoming brotherhood between these two men is explored in this film, and this bond and theme of family is a cornerstone of the franchise so it's good to see this being developed.The action sequences and driving stunts are all very enjoyable. A step up from the first few films, but not quite reaching the ludicrousness of later instalments.Justin Lin demonstrates that he really understands this franchise, making an energetic film with a pacey plot, decent twists, and plenty of exhilarating action.All in all this makes for a very fun film, and lets be honest if you are watching a 'Fast' film and are expecting more than just fun then you are barking up the wrong tree.",ethanbresnett,2022-03-26,2022
128,10.0,one of the best action movies ever made,"This movie is one of my favorites, and starts with a heist in the middle of the mountains with dom and his family.then after the opening we discover letty is missing and brian is a cop again. So in many ways this movie takes place after the first and everybody returns and theres new people in the crew. For me the best scenes are -the audition race, in the night, filmed in locations that look real and everything seems to be happen in a real city(never feels like a movie set) -how dom here is a detective and he finds what happened to letty and why, just visiting the place -the whole third act, when dom and brian are friends again and both try to catch the bad guy in the desert.not only the movie becomes a action movie with alot of nice scenes, you see both brian and dom working togheter, and obviusly now mia is back with brian, and dom have his charger ready to race and go. The music is great, the action feels real, and the drama is really good. Also theres jokes(like when they ask brian how many cars he wants and he say he wants them all)for car fans, dom is seen back in his garage working.he build two cars in the movie. Brian build one and get one free because dom. Wish this movie have better rating, is funny to watch and never dissapoints.",Cinema2kMendoza,2022-04-03,2022

130,2.0,lazy and phoned in,"I thought this was the first movie and honestly wanted to see the appeal as in middle school or really early high school it seemed you HAD to see this movie.. well.. I watched the wrong movie first in the series. How did anyone think this was a good idea to call the movie ""fast and furious"" instead of coming up with some clever name. If some other studio put out a movie they'd run to their lawyers and sue.Vin Diesel is so boring in this movie. It's like he doesn't want to be there. He just mumbles through every line for a pay cheque. How could anyone want him to be a leading man? What's his appeal? Does he look ""legit"". He looks like a mixture of Ron Pealman which many of you may know from Sons Of Anarchy or Hellboy. As well as Bruce Willis or Steven Seagal. He can't act to save his life.The plot is so uninspired even if I spoiled it, it doesn't matter, it's that dull where a hundred movies have done a similar plot but better. There are a few cool car chases but it just SCREAMS direct to video especially how many scenes are recycled. They heavily rely on some tunnel. The cars weren't very impressive and the worst thing going for this movie is the dialogue seems like it was written by someones 14 year old son. The last time I saw insults back and forth that bad was in middle school. The cars are forgetful other than the green one the bad guy (i think) drove and of course whatever greasy car Vin could get his mitts on.Skip this one.",talllwoood13,2022-05-25,2022

133,8.0,Most believable move of the series.,I have watched all the F & F movies. Most of them have high octane chases. But it stopped making sense after the F & F 6 movie. Addition of Rock was not very helpful in the story line. May be they should have kept it close to the racing part. The best movie based on racing I believe is Ford vs Ferrari. The detail and story and the need for racing in the first place all made sense. And I believe the F & F 4 was close to it. The need to pass the mountains with time limit made sense and having the best racers was justified for the task.,swapneelshinde,2023-01-27,2023
134,6.0,"Fun , But Too Much of the Same","The movie doesn't disappoint , but it provides you a cookie cutter plot of previous installments. It's still fun seeing this group together, but the story is even less intriguing in parts than the others. The villain has no background other than just a really good drug trafficker and the movie is otherwise used to bring Dom back into the fold. The last chase scene also leaves much to be desired. You often can't tell who is in which car chasing who for about ten minutes. Finally at the end you get the showdown you knew was coming with a very predictable result.Overall it's fine as part of the series but it definitely won't stand out as one of the better ones.",ThereelscoopwithKK,2023-02-21,2023

The race through the tunnels is especially fun.Explosions, fast cars, speed and fun characters. This movie is made to entertain us and it succeeds in that.The stunts are again excellent and we have the opportunity to see how the team tuned the great cars.There are excellent extras on the blu-ray disc where we can see the whole process.A fun addition to the franchise that works as a fun crime story.",dk777,2023-03-23,2023
138,9.0,The stakes are going up,"The movie ""Fast and Furious 4"" is a classic representative of the genre of action and movies about cool cars, which fully justifies all the expectations of fans. The original cast returns to the series, viewers will be able to see their favorite characters again, played by Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster.The plot of the film departs a little from the original source, where we enjoyed the world of night street racing. Now the emphasis is on the criminal component, where the stakes are repeatedly raised, and the heroes will have to learn to live in a new way and go to meet dangerous opponents.The action in the film keeps the viewer's attention from start to finish, and hardcore racing in underground tunnels is simply breathtaking. The creators have put a lot of effort into creating special effects that look very spectacular and convincing.Paul Walker and Vin Diesel once again prove their acting talent and professionalism by playing their roles at the highest level. They create convincing images that will not leave any viewer indifferent. Their interaction and the dynamics of their relationship create a real chemistry on the screen, and this makes the film even more fascinating and interesting. We will see the confrontation and tension between the heroes, because the current situation allows only one of them to succeed, despite the fact that each of the heroes has their own motivation and there is no way to step back in their aspirations.Unfortunately, the main villain of the film was not impressed. His predecessor looked much more convincing in the second part of the gasoline saga. The antagonist's assistant, with whom the hero of Diesel Dominic Toretto has his own scores, looks much more convincing. It is this confrontation that is of particular interest. But the main thing in the film is wild racing and high stakes, where every mistake behind the wheel and outside it can be decisive for the characters.The acting of Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster is undoubtedly one of the main advantages of the film. They managed to create that inexplicable charm, thanks to which the viewer simply falls in love with the characters. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are an integral part of the franchise, and their tandem has long been one of the main symbols of the cult saga.One of the main advantages of ""Fast and Furious 4"" is its visual performance. The film was shot very beautifully and qualitatively, with beautiful landscapes and incredible tricks that amaze the imagination. The color palette is ready to please the viewer. At some point we will see bright chases in broad daylight, and in another case we will enjoy the dark dungeons through which the characters of the picture will drive. Director Justin Lin coped with his work at the highest level, creating a fascinating and exciting atmosphere that does not allow the viewer to relax for a minute. He has already staged a good ""Tokyo Drift"", and the man has several more pictures about ""Fast and Furious"" ahead of him. And each subsequent film will be much more amazing than the previous one.In general, ""Fast and Furious 4"" is a great movie that is definitely worth watching for all fans of the genre. It contains all the necessary elements to become a real hit: an excellent plot, spectacular stunts, good acting and beautiful visualization. This is really one of the best films in the series, which will not leave anyone indifferent.9 out of 10.",alekspredator87,2023-04-27,2023
139,7.0,Real franchise starter,"This is probably the first film from the franchise I saw and it does feel like this is setting up to be a real franchise while the three films before all kind of felt stand-alone in some way. This is as good as the first one in my opinion even though it moves away from what made the first one a bit special and leaned into the more glossy aspects but it works very very well here. The action setpieces are all wonderfully done but the editing bogs this down a bit. It kinda felt like they are too focused on making it feel tightly packed that they edited out a lot of important stuff. The last chase scene especially felt a bit weird with the editing and there were many moments where the events and timeline felt a bit off which I assume is due to editing out stuff that should've been in there. But it is a very entertaining movie and if not for the editing issue, I would have put it above the first one.This is also where the retconning in the franchise started. Han came back to show Tokyo Drift would be happening after this. But that event and all the main character motivations in this movie coming back in the future to get retconned again seems really lazy from here when I think about it because when I saw them randomly I didn't even remember most of it. Let's see how the franchise holds up now.",Jithindurden,2023-04-27,2023

It was the best in the franchise so far, I was actually surprised with how much plot was in this movie and there seemed to be more importance focused on the story.

But if you've had any experience at all with cars or street racing, you know that nitrous oxide isn't all that the movie makes it out to be. You don't simply turn it one whenever you want to win or accelerate at random. It's really sad that they don't focus on the cars themselves more.To all the others. Please only review the movie itself. Don't simply complain about ads. Ads are advertisements. Advertisements are commercials. Commercials are commerce and commerce is money. They need money to make the game so complaining about ads is just a waste of everyone's time.",dbarr123,2023-05-21,2023

146,7.0,Great stunts in this action packed FNF entry that goes back to what made this series gold.,"This is the fourth entry in the Fast and The Furious franchise and it really goes back to five years after the first film revisiting our favorite characters Dom, Brian, Letty, Mia and we see Han again. The on screen chemistry or camaraderie is still there between Brian and Dom...and Brian and Mia.Brian has his FBI job back and the cops are hot on Dom, so Dom leaves Letty who ends up dead. Dom comes to Letty's LA funeral and goes after her killer. This puts him on a collision course with Brian who is also trying to take down a big time drug dealer named Braga.There are more great driving stunts and just some great stunts altogether...fight scenes, explosions...and definitely some great cars, all held together with a thrilling soundtrack.Dominican Republic, Mexico and LA are all backdrops for this great fast and furious reunion. This might be my second favorite film (next to the first) in the series thus far.",cgvsluis,2023-05-29,2023
147,5.0,Disjointed,"Despite this film being the first time Dom and Bryan reunite since the first film, this film leaves a lot to be desired. Letti's death is emotional and enough motivation to drive Dom and the film. But I felt it could have had more of a plot or additional storylines to make more interesting. Also Dom, despite being a stoic character, does not show the audience he's that affected. We don't see enough emotion and intensity that supposedly exists. The action scenes are also a bit of a let down and insults the viewers intelligence. We see some unrealistic action scenes and a lot of plot armour that shields the main characters and villains. Overall the film felt disjointed and it abruptly transitioned from one scene to another and a lot plot points could have been explained better, the viewer had to quickly piece these together to assume what was going on. A weak entry in the franchise.",Kingslaay,2023-05-31,2023
148,7.0,Time to Race! (Again!),"Review:It's really more of the same stuff from the first three movies with the cars. So nothing really new. However I am glad that we finally got an actual direct sequel to the Original movie with The Four Main Stars returning (Diesel, Walker, Rodriguez, and Brewster) Takeaways: -The Four main characters of the first movie are back and reunited!! Yay! Well that's actually a little misleading, because SPOILER........................................ Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is seemingly shot and killed in the first 10 minutes of the movie! This of course sets that whole plot in motion, and causes Brian Dominic and Mia to reunite to track down the guy responsible -The whole cast is great again, and it's like they never even left! -Vin Diesel is Back!!! Dominic Torretto was still Street racing and still robbing things with Letty. They have been hiding in the Dominican Republic with new comrade Han Lue (a returning Sung Kang. This movie took place before his death in Movie 3.) however Dom is angry after Letty is killed and he is going after the man who killed her for vengeance. He strikes a deal with Brian O'Connor to help bust the criminal operation that Letty's killer is a part of, and in exchange, Brian will make sure Dom gets a pardon and pass from prison for his help. Dom doesn't care about not running, until he finds out that Letty was secretly working with Brian to get Dom's Criminal record wiped, by investigating the crime gang. That was what May have gotten her killed. -Also from this point Foward, Vin Diesel is now one of the guardians of the franchise. Vin Diesel has more involvement with the franchise as series Producer and not just as a Star. -Paul Walker nails it again as Brian! Brian O'Connor is now an FBI Agent tracking down the car crime gang, responsible for Letty's murder. He must also redeem himself in the eyes of the family that he betrayed. At first Dom and Mia want nothing to do with him, because he broke their trust years ago, when he revealed that he was an undercover cop investigating them. When they all team up to get Justice for Letty, Brian eventually reconciles with both of them and he also restarts his relationship with Mia. -Gal Gadot debuts as Street racer Giselle Yashar. -I love that Dom and Brian had a Race Rematch. Though we don't know who actually won lol. -Letty is avenged when Dom shoots down her murderer. He then decides that he is Done with running and with crime, and turns himself in, with the hopes that Brian can fulfill his end of the bargain and clear him. The ending was sad when, the Judge could not fulfill Brian's request and give Don freedom and he sentences Dom to a long time in prison. Brian is furious that the Justice system failed Dom, so he and Mia decide to bust him out of the prison transport. As a result all three of them are now in hiding. Conclusion: it is a sequel that puts a step step in the right direction, and starts a good action packed Brian/Dom/Letty storyline that concludes with the 7th film.",myblueblazer,2023-06-01,2023
149,10.0,Fast and furious awesome franchise,"Fast & Furious (2009) is an awesome Action packed sequel, where The Fast and the Furious (2001) stopped. This is the real sequel to The Fast and The Furious. I love that Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster reprise their roles back to the roots the way they were. This is my fourth favorite best film in the series, this film Is a seat to the edge from the beginning till the end. This movie kept me thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. Sure it's a little far fetched, but who cares? It's a movie, and definitely not as bad as some people are saying. Besides, the point of watching a movie is to escape reality so I don't understand why people complain when movies are not realistic. Provided a cinematic equivalent of NOS to the franchise with a tone shift that helped make it one of the most popular and profitable action series in the last decade. Excellent flick. Much better than the middle two. Just forget those movies happened. This was good balls to the walls action with much better actors with the original 4 back together. Bad idea making 2 and 3 :) Vin Diesel and Paul Walker re team with Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster for the ultimate chapter of the franchise built on speed! When fugitive Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) returns to Los Angeles to avenge a loved one's death, it reignites his feud with agent Brian O'Conner (Walker). But, as they race through crowded city streets and across international lines, they must test their loyalties by joining together to bring down a shared enemy. From big rig heists to precision tunnel crawls, Fast & Furious takes you back into the high-octane world, which lives for speed, drives for the rush and breaks all the rules! ‘Maybe you're the bad guy pretending to be the good guy.’ This film is more about stopping a notorious drug lord Arturo Braga and avenging the murder of Letty (Michelle Rodriguez). This film is set back in Los Angles when everything started, after 5.years of leaving the city of Angeles for Dominican Republic after Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew become a Wanted Fugitives. Letty was murdered when she was mixed up in a drug racers mule cartel. She knew the people who hired her, will double crossed her, while trying to escape the flying bullets she was killed by a drug lord's henchman. That weary angrier Dom (Vin Diesel) brings him back to Los Angeles, to avenge his loved one's death and tracking down Drug Lord Braga and killing him. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), is now an FBI agent, and he is assigned to track down a notorious drug lord named Arturo Braga. Both men faces each other in a final showdown. Braga is looking for a fast drivers that are driving and smuggling trough desert New Mexico drugs. Brian goes again undercover only to find out that he and Dom (Vin Diesel) are been double crossed and set up on the same way that was Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) was. This film is filled with full action, fast cars, full of stunts and beautiful women. Gal Gadot is tremendous as Gisele Harabo it was her first role in this film and she was awesome, she acted the character terrific. Paul walker was the best in this film, finally, finally they did something with the character, he become an FBI Agent which I love that with the character In this movie. I love that Dom (Vin Diesel) at the end of the film didn't run, he surrender and I love how Brian ( Paul Walker) was testifying for him in the court. Seriously this film Kicks ass, although I prefer Fast Five over this Action Flick, but that doesn't mean this film did not do the job right, it did! And this film is highly underrated and criticized by critics. Also Han (Sung Kang) has a small scene in the beginning of this film, that was before they killed the beloved character in The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006).",ka-09820,2023-06-03,2023

151,6.0,I know it'll get better than this but I was somewhat let down...,"I'm watching all of these movies since my friend recommended them to me since Fast X just came out. The first two were just okay, and so was this one. I just couldn't really get that into it. While this may not be the case with some people, I find these characters to be mostly shallowly written and I just don't really care about them. The action in these films is easily the best thing about them, and there were a couple of pretty cool scenes with Vin Diesel toward the end which I enjoyed. I also liked the presence of some actresses like Gal Gadot and Jordana Brewster too. That's about it though, but I'll try to keep watching. I know that the action at least can for sure get better and better! Just a question of when I will start to actually care about the characters and story.",SPZMaxinema,2023-06-05,2023
152,6.0,I miss this Dom & Brian pairing!,"This fourth chapter may have had numerous shortcomings, but it succeeded in establishing, or should I say revitalising, the ties between our main leads.I have always admired the pairing of Dom and Brian; their friendship and brotherhood worked marvels over the years, and it's one of the main reasons why I kept returning to the series and never grew tired of it.If Paul had not met with such unfortunate and untimely demise, I do believe this series would have produced more positive outcomes. Brian as a character would have had lots of room to grow, could have had opportunities to flourish, but I guess, it wasn't meant to be, as fate had other plans for him.R. I. P.

153,7.0,great movie,"Fast And Furious is a great movie with a well developed storyline that takes the Fast and the Furious franchise back to where it belongs. They clearly realize that these movies are better off with the same people,in the second one it was only Paul Walker with a main role and in the third the cast is completely different. I found this one much better,even better than the first in my opinion,it seems more mature and focuses more on a good story rather than just good car chases,don't worry though,there's plenty of time for that as well. Clearly the Fast and Furious movies can only continue with Vin Diesel and Paul Walker,and from this one forward they realize that,and the fifth only improves. Fans of the first Fast and Furious will be very pleased with this installment.",yasin-35462,2023-06-22,2023
154,6.0,Sporting Braga,"Fascinatingly, after two sequels with lower budgets and diminishing returns, for whatever reason, the Fast and Furious franchise switches gears (pun intended) and starts us down the road towards the wild and crazy world we're in now. This one is still relatively tame, but watchable enough.When Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is killed, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) returns to Los Angeles to investigate. Also investigating is Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) who is now an FBI agent looking into the operations of a Drug Kingpin Braga whom Letty was working for when she died. Both Brian and Dom attempt to infiltrate the cartel, using Ramon (John Ortiz) who finds drivers for Braga, as their route in. There is only one spot on the team though, and they must race to decide who gets it.So yes, it's all still relatively lacklustre at this point. They're no longer knocking of DVD players, but the villains are still just drug dealers rather than limitless international terrorist organisations. Dom's already getting into superhero mode though, as he's shot at one point in this and just shrugs it off. Despite saying it's relatively grounded there are three characters in this film who will come back from the dead at some point in the series! There main four characters are all back though, along with Han, who heads off to Tokyo after the opening scene - making this a prequel to Tokyo Drift - an idea which was again retconned later on. Gal Godot joins the cast as Gisele though there's little in this particular performance to suggest that she would be coming back again after the end of this plot. Laz Alonso is also in the film, as Braga's right hand man Fenix and though he has a memorable death, he gets to do a lot more as Mother's Milk in ""The Boys"".Even with all that awful Pitbull Music, the film isn't bad and is watchable enough. The stunts are getting better and the characters are starting to accumulate into ""the family"" that will feature in the next six films. Onwards to ""Fast 5"".",southdavid,2023-06-23,2023

158,6.0,Slow and Steady,"Bringing the entire cast together for the first time, Fast & Furious begins to shape out the iconic franchise. The story is not the most interesting and with unexplained circumstances, it begins to lose the realistic feel of the previous installments.

Redeeming that as best as possible, the cast all do a charming job, as you can tell that they have fun and enjoy working together.

161,4.0,Fast & Furious (2009) Tries to be more serious and loses speed,"Perhaps this will be the turning point of the Fast and Furious franchise. This is where we see the change from a plot that involves street racing to something much bigger, but we are still not presented with more intense action. This is the big problem with the fourth film in the franchise. He cannot maintain the simplicity of the previous ones, but he does not risk the megalomania of the later ones. The film focuses on a drama that cannot carry. Everything that tries to be dramatic in the narrative becomes clumsy. The direction doesn't handle the drama well, the actors don't have the capacity to do it and the entire atmosphere that tries to have a more dramatic and serious aura becomes just cheesy.

164,8.0,overhated,"""Fast & Furious"" is slightly below the levels of the first three films. Everyone says that this fourth chapter of the saga is a total flop, a bad movie...but I say the opposite. For me Fast and Furious 4 is a great movie, fun and never boring. This is the first film of the new era of the saga, no longer focused on illegal car racing but rightly implements a great change: it becomes an action film, with shootings and much more, always giving more space to cars. According to many the choice to make the saga become an action franchise is bad but I think it's perfect: imagine a saga that for 10 movies always brings the same story about the illegality of motor racing. Well, I would say that it would be quite boring. The plot of the film is the thing that convinced me the least, I think it loses a lot compared to previous films. In contrast, however, I loved the difficult situation that there is between the family Toretto and Brian, but with a nice journey together during the film: the two are a phenonemal couple and together they work perfectly. I also loved the dramatic side of the film with Toretto tight-knit by the police about to get to him. I really liked the direction of Justin Lin that after ""Tokyo drift"" reconfirms with excellent action scenes. I think Vin Diesel improves his performance and with him Brian becomes even better in my opinion. I liked the inclusion of Gisele played by the beautiful Gal Gadot. I liked the film's antagonist, Braga, played well by John Ortiz. The film's photography is still excellent in this fourth chapter. The ending of the film really gets me excited about the fifth film, which I can't wait to see again..

Here the franchise gets started again for what we now know it for. Decision to bring both Brian and Dom back is what makes this one really work. While the villains aren't as strong here, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker really make this fun to watch with the dynamic the two are having. The twist with who is Braga isn't quite pulled off here, I thought this was really predictable but still the car chases and action scenes here are fun and make me look away from the little flaws the story has. So this really was about getting back in form for the three great movies coming next to the franchise.",tk_ew,2024-05-30,2024

167,6.0,The self-titled film in the Fast & Furious franchise.,"Fast & Furious is the springboard that takes the series from being a trilogy focusing on car culture to an over-the-top, juggernaut action film franchise. A litmus test to see if viewers are ready to leave ""grounded"" action behind and buckle in for some super-human-type action that prioritizes badassery above all.The plot is a mess, even by Fast & Furious standards, but the plot is far from the most important aspect of making a great Fast & Furious film. It does feel unique from others as it features the most tension between Brian and Dom, while also giving us a Detective Dom acting like Batman.",mediatation,2024-06-20,2024
168,6.0,Fast & Furious - Jamison Slabaugh,A fun thrilling ride as per usual for The Fast and Furious franchise. This film has some minor pacing issues and makes a few mistakes when it comes to plot decisions. I think the plot was really strong in the first half of the film with the surprise of Letty's death. You start to see the friendship and the bond that Brian and Dom used to have reform until the tense that builds when we realize that Letty was working for Brian and Dom freaks out. I think it was a great use of tension until they didn't continue anything with it once the scene cut away. The love story of Brian and Mia in this film is very weak as we don't see anything about how that reforms we just see them randomly start making out in the kitchen. The antagonist is basic and weak in my opinion. We know nothing about him besides he is a drug dealer and he is the reason Letty is dead. He should've had more depth in my opinion. I'm also not sure why these films seem to clock out at 1 hour and 45 minutes instead of taking a few more scenes and giving some more depth to these characters. That or cut down some of the unnecessary junk and replace it with depth. Stop giving us John Wick antagonists. Dom on the other hand has some good development as he finally decides to stop running. Brian decides to finally get his own code straight and start helping his friends and family. Other than that the cinematography in this film is definitely at an all time high for the franchise. The score has also improved. 6/10 STARS.,jamisonslabaugh,2024-07-06,2024

Rewatching the 2009 film Fast and Furious, I find myself with mixed feelings about it. This film was touted as a return to form with the original cast back on board. They do elevate it, but I've never been a huge fan of this film as it misses the heart that made the first work so well.One thing I do appreciate is seeing Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, and Jordana Brewster back together. Their chemistry and familiarity bring a certain energy to the film that's hard to deny. However, the storyline doesn't give them as much character development as I'd like. John Ortiz does well as the villain, but it's a shame the main characters don't get as much development.The action sequences are thrilling, and the CGI chases are visually impressive. Yet, as a whole, heart got swapped for CGI and it affects the film a little. The film leans heavily on its high-octane set pieces, sometimes at the expense of the emotional depth that made the first film so compelling. While the action is enjoyable, it feels like something is missing.Despite these shortcomings, it's still an enjoyable way to pass the time. The film manages to keep me entertained with its fast pace and flashy visuals. I also appreciate how this instalment leads to some very entertaining films later on. It sets the stage for the franchise to evolve into the global phenomenon it is today.There are scenes that hint at the deeper connections between characters, even if they're not fully explored. The film's soundtrack also adds to the overall experience, enhancing the high-energy atmosphere.Overall, Fast and Furious is a fairly middling entry in the series that delivers on action but falls short on character development and emotional resonance. While it's not my favourite, it's still a decent film that paves the way for more exciting adventures in the franchise. Your mileage may vary.FORMAT: Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.0

170,6.0,Sloppy fun,"I have to be honest - I watched this back-to-back with Fast Five, and that one was kind of amazing, to the point where I now struggle to remember much of what happened in Fast & Furious (AKA the fourth movie in the series). But I still thought it was a pretty decent watch, and arguably the point where the series becomes what it's best known for being. It feels like a proper sequel to the original movie, in contrast to 2 Fast 2 Furious and Tokyo Drift, which almost feel more like spin-offs to the original, in hindsight.It's fascinating watching the series kind of take shape. There are still more old-school car races in this one, and probably the best scene in the film is still a race. But there are hints at the series becoming more here, with those hints paying off in a huge way in the kind of amazing Fast Five. It's a great warm-up for that film, introducing a few characters who'll go on to play a part there, while also bringing the characters of the first movie back together; back onto the same playing field.It is somewhat awkwardly assembled, and certainly has its flaws as an individual movie. But I can already see it as a necessary stepping stone for the Fast and Furious series as a whole. Honestly, even with it being messy, I still think I liked it more than the first and third movies (of the original four, 2 Fast 2 Furious is still the best, though. Guess I'll die on that hill.).",Jeremy_Urquhart,2024-07-26,2024
171,5.0,I have rarely felt so few emotions while watching a movie,"Fast and Furious = 5/10Fast and Furious is a kind of new beginning for the film series and now focuses more on a gangster plot than on pure racing, which the film only implements so mediocrely.Vin Diesel, as the face of the franchise, plays emotionless as always, but has a good dynamic with Paul Walker. The remaining characters are not worth mentioning as they have no charm or good dialogue.The plot is average. Dom tries to find his girlfriend's murderer and the film always tries to include action scenes with cars in order to find an argument why the film is set in the Fast and Furious franchise.The car action, especially the first part of the film, is sometimes really fun and exciting, but suffers from too hectic editing and poorly directed camera work.So this film sinks into absolute mediocrity, it's not incredibly bad but it's definitely not good either. The characters are too poorly written, the plot is too thin and the car scenes are surprisingly poorly done, even if they are fun to watch.It's hard to say anything at all about this film because it hardly triggers any emotions, it's not special in any way.But the film takes a new direction and delivers some fast-paced car scenes.",alexanderpratl,2024-09-14,2024
172,5.0,They had to make something,I don't know what they were thinking with the 3 rd movie it was boring and bland the whole story line was trying something different that was a flop then getting back to what an show the movie should be but this one is still off because of way he leaves everyone to be by himself and then letty starts randomly working for a drug lord that doesn't seem like something they would get involved with.his sister Mia is bland and boring someone else definitely should have played that part vin deisel is half black but he alway seems to avoid having black family in anything he plays he will play any other race but that similar to the rock who embraces his Samoan race but never his black side.the funeral was nothing of importance may as well have not been part of the movie there's no real emotions behind her death at all she was murdered and vin diesel is bland and dry as usual he besides driving the cars vin deisel brings nothing to these movies but a robotic presence Paul walker with all the rest of the cast make the movie. Paul walker always brought a natural presence to all the movies he shows the emotions when needed the toughness the love the bad boy or the cop.he's versatile .its hard to watch the ones he's not in the girls with no clothes get air beat over the top we know everyone loves to exploit woman sex sales draw the crept men in to watch but there's never a element of sexy men for woman this was made to be a guys movie.,tamrbrwn-59647,2024-09-25,2024
173,8.0,The best Fast and Furious film so far,"I remember last time I reviewed Fast and Furious 7, I mentioned that how I ended up watching this franchise. After I watched film 1-7 , I was clearly thinking that this film is not only the best film in the franchise, but it is also one of my most favourite film in recent years. The story: The story is like traditional buddy cop formula. It involves Dominic, who recently find out Letty has been killed in a car crash, investigating who is the culprit behind the incident. On the way, he meet back Brian, who is finding a drug lord, and let both of them in a street race. Dominic and Brian, which are still having issues for each other, meet Fenix, and Dominic find out that he is the one who killed Letty. He team up with Brian to hunt down Fenix, but the plan fails first time. They then get help and get Braga back to border, and kill Fenix on the way. Dominic do not escape and get sentenced while Brian decide to stay back with him. The storyline is pretty basic, but it is really entertaining and unique in a spy film. The relations between each elements is fluent and cohesive as well. From how Dominic and Brian reunite, to how street race affect the plan, and how Letty is related to Brian. The street race and dramatic scenes are really a standard yet unique storyline in films belong to same genre. I felt focused and enjoyed during the whole movie, which is why this movie has one of the best stories in the franchise as a whole. The visuals: The scene are very fluent and clearly, which is on par with industrial standards. What really stand out is that the flashbacks are really transparent with the present situation, and the explosions are one of the better ones in the films I watched. The car chase scenes are really convincing and motived, and I liked the overall dark photography, which the cars and actions are still clear while at the dark, and reflecting on how Dominic feel at that moment. Overall, those visuals are average but some unique moments from the view of director Justin Lin and convincing explosions really bring the whole movie become more colourful to look at. The characters: The characters in this film really stand out from the whole franchises. I really liked the chemistry between Dominic and Brian, and felt like both of them are the main characters. Dominic is interesting in this film. He uses his mean and revengeful personality to help defeat Fenix, and is less annoying than the further installments when he would form a group called ‘family’. Brian is dynamic and serious in this film, which helped enhancing the chemistry between him and Dominic and justified how they end up caring each other, while also brought his charisma back in the film. Fenix and Braga is a threat enough to bring both of the men in trouble and making Brian looked vulnerable, which is a good sign for a franchise increasingly solidify each main characters. Mia and Gisele also helped the main character to defeat Fenix, and their characters really merged into the film seamlessly. The characters is this film are really fused together, and each of them is interesting in their own way, and brought me no annoyance whatsoever, which bring this film stand out from the whole franchise. Verdict: The film did not let me feeling bored during the screen time, which is outstanding compared to other films in the franchise. The story is unique and a good blend between how the film established in and new genre translation. The visuals is good among the industry. What I like the most is the characters, especially the patching up between Dominic and Brian, and let both of them being hurt by both mentally and physically, really convincing they they are the main characters that are interesting. I am never a fan of a certain actor, including Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, but I will defend them if someone told me that they are not a good actor in this film. I still feel that Paul Walker himself is behind me, but this is the best film for his character, and is the best film from the character portrayed by his buddy Vin Diesel, and is one the the best film I have seen to date.

174,6.0,Decent,"Fast & Furious (2009), the fourth installment in the Fast and Furious franchise, brings back the original cast and a grittier tone after the more standalone third film. The reunion of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker is a highlight, as their chemistry helps rekindle the dynamic that fans loved from the first movie. The action sequences are well-executed, with high-speed chases and adrenaline-pumping stunts that keep viewers on the edge of their seats.However, while the film delivers in terms of spectacle, it falls short in other areas. The plot is formulaic, with the revenge storyline feeling somewhat predictable and lacking depth. The character development is minimal, and the emotional stakes don't quite land as effectively as they should. Some scenes feel more like a setup for future installments rather than fully realized moments within this one.Overall, Fast & Furious is an entertaining watch, especially for fans of the series, but it doesn't quite hit the same high notes as the original. It's a decent chapter in the franchise, but it doesn't stand out as one of the best. 6/10.",Bmore-Hero,2024-10-17,2024
175,10.0,The movie is better than previous installments,"Fast & Furious 4 is a thrilling ride that takes us back to the roots of the franchise, showcasing the raw power of family and loyalty.The film explodes with high-octane action, featuring incredible car chases and daring stunts that will leave you breathless.The chemistry between Vin Diesel and Paul Walker is undeniable, reminding us why they are the heart and soul of the franchise.The film expertly blends action and emotion, creating a deeply engaging and satisfying experience.The return of Letty is a highlight of the film, adding a layer of intensity and emotional depth to the story.The film's setting in the Dominican Republic adds a vibrant and exotic backdrop to the action.The car chases are expertly crafted, showcasing the beauty and power of classic muscle cars.The film's soundtrack is a perfect blend of hard-hitting hip-hop and classic rock anthems, adding to the film's energy.Fast & Furious 4 is a reminder that family is everything, even when it's a family of criminals.This film is a must-see for any fan of high-octane action and heart-pounding thrills.",botch-30879,2024-10-23,2024
176,4.0,The first of these films to be worse than I remember.,"Fast and Furious (2009) is the ramp to what the series would become. From films about racing cars, to action-packed heist ridiculousness. As such, it suffers a great deal. We have a film that's trying so hard to be serious, and in that very same film we have Detective Dominic recreate a car crash and shooting in his mind just from tracks.What's even worse is that the later entries in the franchise retroactively make this film nearly pointless, turning it into a bombastic vehicle to introduce and reintroduce mainstay characters. But I won't take that part into account for this review, it's more a failing of the entire franchise.Fortunately there's some good parts. Less CGI and actual stunts, even if they are completely stupid, make the action more enjoyable to watch. It was also nice to see the characters we learned about in the first film finally interact with each other again, after their brief spin-off sojourns.But, it's not enough to make this film enjoyable for me. The other movies are at least a lot of fun. This one is dour and miserable by comparison. Thankfully, the film after this one is probably the best in the series.",H4wke,2024-11-05,2024
177,8.0,A Fitting End to the 2000s Fast and Furious Era,"Fast & Furious (2009), the fourth installment of the popular franchise, serves as a thrilling last hurrah for the 2000s era while paving the way for what the series has become in the 2010s and beyond (still debating whether this is a good thing or bad thing). The film brings back fan-favorite characters Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster), and Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) after their absence in the third movie, Tokyo Drift.The plot revolving around Letty's (Michelle Rodriguez) ""death"" and the rekindling of Brian's romantic relationship with Mia is an intriguing premise that keeps the audience engaged. Additionally, the film explores the complex relationship between Brian and Dom, which adds depth to the story. The introduction of Giselle (Gal Gadot) as a new character also proves to be a welcome addition to the series.One aspect of the film that left me slightly confused was Mia's anger towards Brian for tearing her family apart. Given her lack of contact with him since 2001, it seemed unfair for her to place the blame solely on him. However, this minor issue does not detract significantly from the overall enjoyment of the movie.The film balances the grounded storyline with the inclusion of the FBI and high-profile organizations and agencies. The action sequences and stunts, a staple of the franchise, are well-executed and contribute to the adrenaline-pumping experience.In conclusion, while Fast & Furious (2009) may not be one of my personal favorite in the franchise, it is still a highly entertaining and solid addition to the series. It serves as an excellent end to the 2000s era of the Fast and Furious saga and sets the stage for the more over-the-top and action-packed sequels to come.",douglasc11,2025-01-04,2025
178,6.0,Maybe the first true sequel in the Franchise,"The rating may be a bit skewed because of how frustrating it was for me to watch this one instead of the original when I decided to dive back into this franchise. The name of this movie being so close to the original when really it is the 4th movie in the series is a little annoying, but then it sort of made sense because it is the first one that truly feels like a sequel. The last two movies had different characters and different storylines, but this one goes back to the basics and does it well. The only reason I knocked it down a point from the original is because it is just so similar, but lacks some of the dramatic complexities from the first movie. However, if you are looking for this one to scratch that itch the first movie gave you, it is an excellent choice. Some of the driving sequences in this one are really great.",jaredlemin,2025-01-08,2025
179,7.0,The Tough Race: The Return of Slaps and Screeching Tires,"Vin Diesel is back, and this time, he's not here to ask questions or take selfies with Paul Walker. No, here he's growling, speeding, and tearing up the asphalt like speed traps never existed. This fourth installment feels like seeing your ex who's been hitting CrossFit: tougher, more serious, and thankfully, with less of the childish antics from before.Paul Walker, bless him, is like that friend who always tags along, but you're never quite sure why. He's not bad, but let's be real, he's not carrying this franchise on his shoulders. That's Diesel's job. Walker's the clean-cut sidekick who does his part while Diesel saves the franchise with uppercuts and wheelies.This Fast & Furious feels like an evolution: less flashy neon lights, fewer girls twerking on hoods, and more ground-shaking races like a kaiju stomping out of the ocean. It leans harder into being an action movie rather than just a car show-off competition. That newfound maturity is refreshing, though it might make die-hard fans of the OG ""vroom-vroom"" era shed a tear or two.You can tell Justin Lin wanted to calm things down and give the story some substance. Toretto isn't just a guy who drives fast anymore; now he's a man with trauma, a thirst for revenge, and some deeper reflections. Don't get too excited-it's not Bergman-level introspection-but hey, at least the engines aren't the only thing filling the air.The final chase? A high-octane firework show. It's like Michael Bay on steroids, except the explosions actually have a purpose this time. The action makes you sweat like you're strapped to the hood of a Supra flying down the highway of doom at 250 km/h.This fourth installment is Fast & Furious going dark and mature while still keeping the heart-pounding excitement that fans crave. It smells like grease, vengeance, and family-the Toretto house special. If you're looking for something heavy and aren't afraid of getting hit by a monster truck tire, this one's for you.",OniFR,2025-02-05,2025
