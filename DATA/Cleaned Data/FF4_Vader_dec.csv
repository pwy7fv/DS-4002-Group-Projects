3.0,The first one BORING!,"Even the atrocious Tokyo Drift wasn't boring, it was just bad at everything, insulting even, but not boring. This one tried to have a more complex plot/story, with character development and emotive scenes, but without better actors and written dialogue and without sacrificing any second of ‘car scenes’. It failed. Some of the things kind of worked out: -Toretto solidifies himself as a ‘sensitive good’ criminal with a good arc in the movie, (even if probably a bit forced) -Brian finally goes full on criminal -The plot exists and is dense. There are plenty interconnected subplots that end up in a coherent way. But getting those things right, only provoked bigger problems: -A more complex plot required a lot of boring scenes filled with exposition. -A more complex plot showcased how unbelievable the whole thing is. The FBI in particular felt impossibly fake -A more complex and emotional plot required more acting from Paul Walker and Vin Diesel, and they are just terrible actors. -A more complex plot without any realism and depth and overall point (no social commentary, no ideology, no political discussion) gets boring and takes away minutes and chances for more comedic scenes (more appropriate for this franchise)",educallejero,2019-03-24,2019,0.191,0.725,0.084,-0.9825,Negative
4.0,Best in the series so far,"I found that the fourth part was more mature then the ones before. You had the usual racing, no-logic, Little Story, women who willingly offer themselves to anybody and the original cast. But thought it wasn't so dump and flat this time. The actors even... acted from time to time. I liked Vin Diesel very much here. The idea of Brian of beeing a cop and beeing a criminal annoyed me very much. As if no one really had to pay for the crimes they have commited. Well Dom seemed to get like 25 years in prison at the end, which shook me a lot as it ended so abruptly. Sure the Boys and one Girl where about to save him from that...

7.0,Brilliant film.,It's say Brian is back working for the FBI and the movie he does but in the first movie he worked undercover for the LAPD. And what gets me is when they blame Brian when it was the FBI Agent Stasaik. That gave the go order to arrest Braga/Campos.,wesgunton,2019-04-22,2019,0.117,0.883,0.0,-0.7351,Negative

7.0,feels like we're back home,"Beastly movie. Awesome action, great racing scenes, good story. Lots of creative ways to improve on the racing parts. Hate-able villains. So many awesome intense scenes and omg moments. Was pretty deep like the original movie with some good emotional moments and character relationships. Even small things reminded me that we're back in the world created by the original, like dinner with family with a nice song playing, or mia yelling ""dom stop!"" lolit has lots of flaws but this movie is a great time. It brought the series back to where it needed to be. It captured the feel of the first movie.

6.0,Fun but familiar,"Once again, it follows the same plot points as some of the previous installments but Fast and Furious is still fun and its beginning to embrace the ridiculousness.

8.0,Fast and furious,"Fast & Furious (2009) is an awesome Action packed sequel, where The Fast and the Furious (2001) stopped. This is the real sequel to The Fast and The Furious. I love that Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster reprise their roles back to the roots the way they were. This is my fourth favorite best film in the series, this film Is a seat to the edge from the beginning till the end. This movie kept me thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. Sure it's a little far fetched, but who cares?It's a movie, and definitely not as bad as some people are saying. Besides, the point of watching a movie is to escape reality so I don't understand why people complain when movies are not realistic. Provided a cinematic equivalent of NOS to the franchise with a tone shift that helped make it one of the most popular and profitable action series in the last decade. Excellent flick. Much better than the middle two. Just forget those movies happened. This was good balls to the walls action with much better actors with the original 4 back together. Bad idea making 2 and 3 :)Vin Diesel and Paul Walker re team with Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster for the ultimate chapter of the franchise built on speed! When fugitive Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) returns to Los Angeles to avenge a loved one's death, it reignites his feud with agent Brian O'Conner (Walker). But, as they race through crowded city streets and across international lines, they must test their loyalties by joining together to bring down a shared enemy. From big rig heists to precision tunnel crawls, Fast & Furious takes you back into the high-octane world, which lives for speed, drives for the rush and breaks all the rules!""Maybe you're the bad guy pretending to be the good guy.""This film is more about stopping a notorious drug lord Arturo Braga and avenging the murder of Letty (Michelle Rodriguez). This film is set back in Los Angles when everything started, after 5.years of leaving the city of Angeles for Dominican Republic after Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew become a Wanted Fugitives. Letty was murdered when she was mixed up in a drug racers mule cartel. She knew the people who hired her, will double crossed her, while trying to escape the flying bullets she was killed by a drug lord's henchman. That weary angrier Dom (Vin Diesel) brings him back to Los Angeles, to avenge his loved one's death and tracking down Drug Lord Braga and killing him. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), is now an FBI agent, and he is assigned to track down a notorious drug lord named Arturo Braga. Both men faces each other in a final showdown. Braga is looking for a fast drivers that are driving and smuggling trough desert New Mexico drugs. Brian goes again undercover only to find out that he and Dom (Vin Diesel) are been double crossed and set up on the same way that was Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) was.This film is filled with full action, fast cars, full of stunts and beautiful women. Gal Gadot is tremendous as Gisele Harabo it was her first role in this film and she was awesome, she acted the character terrific. Paul walker was the best in this film, finally, finally they did something with the character, he become an FBI Agent which I love that with the character In this movie. I love that Dom (Vin Diesel) at the end of the film didn't run, he surrender and I love how Brian ( Paul Walker) was testifying for him in the court. Seriously this film Kicks ass, although I prefer Fast Five over this Action Flick, but that doesn't mean this film did not do the job right, it did! And this film is highly underrated and criticized by critics. Also Han (Sung Kang) has a small scene in the beginning of this film, that was before they killed the beloved character in The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006).The rating I am giving to this film is 9. Anything below 7 would be ridiculous, if anyone would not say that this wasn't At least A GOOD ACTION FILM! (it is sure as hell",dineshaishu,2019-07-28,2019,0.142,0.713,0.144,-0.6027,Negative
6.0,Definately Better Than The Second Film,"Fast and Furious is, in my opinion one of the high points of the early Fast films. I could enjoy Fast and the Furious for what it was. 2 Fast 2 Furious I could not really get into despite the awesome races. Fast and Furious is where I started to like and get into the franchise. There are many reasons for why this is.I find the characters to be better this time around. Vin Diesel's character, Toretto, is back with a vengeance. Him being back, and his character arc in this is one of the main reasons I like this film more than the previous ones. I am also a fan of revenge stories, which made me enjoy this more.I like Paul Walker's character, Brian, more here than any of the previous films. He seems more mature and professional here. In this film he has been reinstated as an FBI agent. I still do not really buy him as an FBI agent; he does come off as more professional and less of a punk in this movie.Jordana Brewster, from the first film, comes back as Mia, who is Brian's love interest. I thought she was fine, but she is not given much to do. The other characters are not much.The villain is also very lazy. The Fast films have never had strong villains, but I find this one particularly weak. The villain in this movie along with the villain in the first film is probably my least favorite villains of these movies.The races are still fun to watch. The races here are probably some of my favorite of the franchise. Although there is some very obvious CGI used in some of the races and car chases which might take you out. There was CGI used in the previous films as well, but here it is particularly noticeable. The CG did irk me, but it did not ruin the action.Overall, Fast and Furious is my second favorite Fast film so far. I definitely like it more than the films before it. I like the darker tone, as well as Vin Diesel and his character arc. The races were also good despite the noticeable CGI. For those who are fans of this franchise give this a look if you have not already.",mitchell5954,2019-08-16,2019,0.113,0.748,0.139,0.7403,Positive

4.0,Fast & Furious (2009),"Directed by Justin Lin. Starring Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, John Ortiz, Gal Gadot, Jack Conley, Shea Whigham, Michelle Rodriguez, Liza Lapira, Laz Alonso, Sung Kang, Tego Calderón, Don Omar. (PG-13)After sitting out a sequel or two, Diesel and Walker are re-teamed as hunk-of-clay Dominic Toretto and scratchy-wooden-plank Brian O'Conner (call 'em Argil n' Poplar!), both out for justice/vengeance against a vaguely nefarious Mexican drug lord. The series was running on fumes by the time they ""got the old gang back together,"" but the production team knew how to craft a loud, sleek machine of populist stupidity, full of fast cars, barely-concealed backsides, substandard CGI, and lots of gravelly proclamations about family, loyalty, and chumps being busters. You get what you expect, but the high-octane chases being reduced to ones-and-zeroes so often is disappointing, as is an instantly forgettable villain who's less threatening than a Geico agent holding insurance claims on all the wrecked candy-colored imports. Not the worst the franchise had to offer, but its technique is more competent than supercharged, and in hindsight, it acted as little more than a transition between the street-racing outlaw dopiness of the previous films and the gargantuan heist/superspy outings to come.43/100",fntstcplnt,2019-09-18,2019,0.095,0.849,0.056,-0.8279,Negative

6.0,Fast & Furious,"Vin Diesel and Paul Walker return to the franchise for the fourth entry after the series' diversion to Tokyo for episode 3. It obviously feels more like an F&F movie with these two in the driver's seats, and director Justin Lin knows exactly what is expected of him as he fills the screen with muscle cars engaged in hair-raising races, macho posturing and hot chicks in hot pants (one of whom is future Wonder Woman Gal Gadot).

7.0,"Action, Excitement, Mystery","The Fast and the Furious series movies always continue with more excitement and action than the previous movie. The first scene of the film, as usual, appears before the audience with the peak of action and tension. The action of the first scenes allows the audience to lock on the screen throughout the movie. The movie feeds the audience to action. Dom's coming back in series 4 gives the audience what he wants, but what happened to Letty is disappointing to the audience.Adding a mystery about Braga to the movie has also contributed greatly to the audience watching the movie with curious looks.There is nothing to say to the cars, they are all very good, very fast and beautifully modified.But this movie is also overshadowed by erotic scenes like the first movie of the series. Especially the kissing scene of two girls does not like people at all. I wish they shoot the movies without adding the erotic scenes into the script.",drmuhammedsamiduru,2020-04-20,2020,0.074,0.784,0.142,0.9445,Positive
5.0,Return of the original cast,This film starts pulling together all the parts of the series that worked. The spin-offs had been somewhat successful but they lacked the core strength of Diesel and Walker being together. Walker has grown into his role over time and the improved dialogue allows for less cringe worthy exchanges. The plot is still generic and is only a slight improvement over number 2. Disappointing plot undermines what should've of a slam dunk. The revenge plot is new for the series and from this moment on the storylines grow even more insane.,nicholls905-280-546911,2020-04-23,2020,0.164,0.677,0.159,-0.3896,Negative
7.0,Tunnel vision across underground jurisdictions infiltration of a truth of enemy creating bonds of knowledge,"In this one. Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, Paul Walker as Brian O'Connor, Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto and Michelle Rodriguez as Leticia ''Letty'' Ortiz. The film also introduces new characters Fenix (Laz Alonso), Omar (Don Omar), Leo Tego (Tego Calderon), Cara Mirtha (Mirtha Michelle) and Campos (John Ortiz). Sung Kang who played Han Seoul-Oh in Tokyo Drift has also made a appearance. We can briefly say that this is the direct sequel to the 2001 film. It begins from where it ended. Brian is at it again he a cop not cop now cop trying tobring down a heroin importer by infiltrating his operation. Director:Justin Lin has done a better thriller We start in Honduras were dom is doing his business robbing a oil tanker with letti But thing go explosive bad So with Brian on the hunt and sniffing round he comes in contact with dom So when Brian gets wind of a job he goes on a hunch to a party finding clues As dom also has grief on his mind he is also on the hunt for a killer but his has him and Brian unite for shared enemy and they are forced to bring him down any way necessary so with La race on the cards for to get a job the two work on a plan even though they don't trust each other so not give away who each other is. Gal gadot this is her first film her character Giselle is a henchwomen for bragga And with honour at stake their is a race but this part is like video game as its goes kind GPS virtual race Bragga his gang try and manipulate certain situations to stay ahead The film focuses mostly on swag, sex appeal, action, hunt and most importantly on the American Muscle cars. Why the film holds my attention is because the film promises on what is says in it's title: Fast & Furious. It's definitely more fast and more furious than the original one. Los Angeles and floors through the Mexican desert. When a crime brings them back to L.A., fugitive ex-con Dom Toretto reignites his feud with agent Brian, Dom and Brian must give in to an uncertain new trust if they hope to outmaneuver him. And from convoy heists to precision stealth tunnels crawls across international lines with close contact racing accidents , two men will find the best way to get revenge: push the their limits and cars they have What a film from start to finish this is the making of the this film series you don't get many film getting better as they get older but this made but my on the seat for every other fast film enjoy the film because I did and the cars I listed out this film rating as you see is 7 and its rating is going up for the rest The Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 that O'Connor 1964 Chevrolet Impala 1769. 1967 Chevrolet C-Series. 1969 Chevrolet Camaro Z28. 1969 Dodge Coronet. 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS. 1970 Dodge Charger. 1970 Plymouth Road Runner. 1971 Cadillac Sedan DeVille.",lark40,2020-05-04,2020,0.1,0.797,0.103,-0.1538,Negative
6.0,Return of the dream team,"Paul Walker and Vin Diesel reunite in this continuation of the Fast & Furious franchise. Dominic and his crew are on the run from the law, while O'Conner has returned back to FBI. But then Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is killed and nothing will ever be the same as both Dominic and Brian seek solace for past sins.The film works mostly for the same reasons the previous films did. It's oozing with style, has very charismatic actors playing characters they were born to play, has very fast and cool cars, features a killer sound track, and is just all around fun to watch.I'd still say the original 2001 film is better, although not by much. It simply had rawer edge to it and had novelty on its side.Still, I very much enjoyed this film. Gal Gadot was a blast as a henchwoman to a drug boss, the car scenes were a ton of fun and the plot was kept well together. Plus, this film was the first step towards a grander scope when it comes to these movies.

7.0,Not to be confused with The Fast and the Furious,"The 4th installment of the Fast & Furious franchise called Fast & and Furious not to be confused with The Fast and the Furious. Which one of the many dumb things about this movie including it takes place before the previous movie, that Brian O'Connor manages to return to being a cop, and the Brian never gives any reason for choosing a life of crime over one in law enforcement but that he respects Dominic more than himself. Before anything else this movie is a dumb entertaining action movie, but there is remnant of a good story, just remnants. The main characters Brain O'Connor and Dominic Toretto start the movie at odds, but ultimately are buddies and are working toward the same goal, the apprehension of the drug dealer. At its core this movie has a base of a good movie, the apprehension of a drug dealer, Brain's struggle with being the good guy, and Dominic's desire for revenge. The chase for the drug dealer is a good action plot with a twist of who Braga is from my perspective I don't think obvious, and lead to an awesome car chase at the end. This the template for all the action and exciting sequences that you can't complain about. Brain O'Connor is somehow allowed back in the FBI and allowed to work around Dominic Toretto even though he let him go. The whole movie he is working toward the goal of capturing the Braga, who is essentialy the mission, but his desire to help Dominic and Mia greater than any other desire. His motives for these actions don't make any sense, if he really cared about Dom and Mia he would help them have a change of heart. These movies basicly preach that if crime is where your family than crime is OK. Dominic Toretto, a revenge story is pretty standard for any movie, but in this movie there isn't any push back to stop the revenge it also glorifies revenge. Brian and Dominic are very morally gray and they see their actions as good and even pray that God bless their day where they steal $60 million dollars of heroin and hide it. Also Mia is pushing back from Brain for the first half of the movie and all of the sudden they start making out. Though all of this is wrapped around to be positive because I is so easy to pick a part and adds to the already entertaining factor of the movie. The movie includes many awesome car chases, a chase on foot with Paul Walker, explostions, and Vin Diesel rams into the guy who killed his girlfriend with a car. The movie is entertaining, dumb, and stupid.",mvpdom,2020-06-18,2020,0.153,0.661,0.186,0.9724,Positive

6.0,Another enjoyable actioner in the franchise.,"Just like the original 'The Fast and the Furious', this film starts off with an impressive truck heist scene - this time a big oil tanker. Although - here - they are pushing reality to the limits.'Fast & Furious' is best viewed as a direct sequel to 2001's 'The Fast and the Furious'. Justin Lin is back in the director's chair. Brian (Paul Walker) is again working for the FBI. Dom (Vin Diesel) and his sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster) are the only original members back for another round. Dom's girlfriend, Letty (Michelle Rodriquez) as well, but only for a very short while. Han (Sung Kang) is in the film's first moments as well, and might seem confusing if you've seen 'Fast and the Furious 3: Tokyo Drift' before this.The film revolves around a drug lord, Braga, who needs racers to transport a shipment of heroin from Mexico to the States. Off course, Dom and Brian are selected, along with a few others. While Brian investigates Braga for the FBI, Dom investigates Letty's murder. There's constant rivalry between Brian and Dom and they're not the friends they were in the original film.'Fast & Furious' is not as easy to follow as 'The Fast and the Furious', but there are a few interesting twists, especially regarding Braga towards the end. There's loads of action and amazing cars. The Mexican desert scene was incredible, as well as the finale with cars racing through an underground tunnel from Mexico to the States.

Sung Kang shows up as Han Lue, Dominic's right-hand man, bridging the last Japanese side of the franchise, while also introducing Gal Gadot as Gisele Yashar, a liaison for the evil Braga. Laz Alonso also shows up as Fenix Calderon, Braga's right-hand man who murders Letty and sets this whole movie's story arc in motion. This movie paved the way - pardon the road pun - for the other movies in this series. In fact, it outgrossed The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift in its first weekend.

6.0,Back to incomprehensibility,"This review contains spoilers. Fast & Furious or Fast & Furious 4 is the fourth installment to The Fast & Furious franchise. The movie is a sequel to The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift but is more of a direct sequel to 2 Fast 2 Furious. The movie features Paul Walker and Vin Diesel as they reprise their roles of Brian O'Conner and Dominic Toretto respectively. The crew from the first movie confront a drug lord called Braga that wrongs both Dominic and Brian. The plot of this movie is incredibly incomprehensible. Many events in the plot simply happen without any reason or the flimsiest of reasoning. This movie's plot is an excuse to show car chases. The story keeps up the action at the expense of the plot. An example of this is in one car race, Brian is knocked out of the race. He is able to use his FBI connections to re-unite with Dominic Toretto by taking another person's place. The other characters and even the villain simply accept this and allow it to happen. The main story of Letty's murder is not well done. This story feels incredibly flimsy and the audience does not even see the murder happen. It is simply in a flashback scene that is told. I understand that the movie wanted to use this event as the reason for Dominic Toretto's mission but it felt incredibly forced. The finale of the movie improves the rest of the movie. With an explosive finale and the story being wrapped up, the movie concludes in a satisfying way. This movie did set up the rest of the series well and this can be considered this installment's strength. I did look forward to the other future installments because of this movie.

7.0,"""Ride or die. Remember?"" - Fast & Furious 4 is an action film worth watching, the chemistry between actors and action keeps me coming back","Fast & Furious 4 is the movie in the Fast & Furious franchise that changed my mind on the films, they found their footing and made it an success at the box office. I also believe it's the turning point and I mean how it ventured out of the racing and into heist, crime and action. Not that I'm complaining, it fits the characters and world they have built from the first and second film. F4 is written by Chris Morgan and directed by Justin Lin. It is a direct sequel to The Fast and the Furious whilst being a prequel to Tokyo Drift. The latter whom Justin Lin also directed.The film is again focused on the core characters of Dominic Toretto, Brian O'Conner,
Letty Ortiz, Mia Toretto, Gisele Yashar and Han Lue, whom are portrayed by Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Gal Gadot and Sung Kang. Whilst the villain, Arturo Braga/Ramon Campos is played by John Ortiz. The story goes deeper into the characters and the main theme of family, Gal Gadot and Sung Kang is a great addition to the cast, Sung Kang previously starred in Tokyo Drift which takes place before Fast 7.Earlier in my review I wrote that there were more focus on heist and action. Well F4 is about races and cars too so if you're a fan of that then you'll be excited, there's some very cool cars in this one. The action sequences are bigger and better than ever, higher budget makes that happen. Whilst the action gets better, the logic behind certain things reduces and the characters like Dominic Toretto becomes strong like an ox and able to get shot without even a flinch... Action films like these likes to make it more entertaining than realistic but I won't lie, I still enjoy the movie and will continue to recommend it. Some bad writing and bad acting is alright for a film like this one, Gal Gadot improves immensely though in the next films. The editing is fairly good and so is the pacing, nothing but praise for them on those fronts.",Holt344,2021-06-05,2021,0.066,0.799,0.135,0.9552,Positive

9.0,Fast & Furious,"This is the best movie of the series so far. It changed the theme from street racing to drug smuggling/revenge. Firstly, I was happy to see the original crew back for the first time since the first movie. It is too bad we had to lose Letty in the first half hour. It ended up working out though because it set up a plot that I thought was good for a Fast and Furious movie. Brian, back working for the FBI, and Dom who is looking to get revenge on Letty's killer both infiltrate a drug smuggler's driving crew. Time passes, the movie gets good, there was a shocking reveal, and some good action. The movie ended with Dom and Brian capturing Braga and trying to get him back to the USA from Mexico to go to prison. There was a daring drive through smuggling tunnels in the border, and Braga eventually getting arrested. The very end of the film had Dom being transferred to a max security prison with Brian, Mia, and Dom's bickering Dominican pals about to break him out of the bus, setting up Fast 5. This was a great movie and I definitely recommend this to everyone. It is very entertaining, but surely they could have named it something else 😂. The name is almost identical to the first movie's title, The Fast and the Furious.",kaden_lewis,2021-07-03,2021,0.113,0.763,0.124,0.4664,Positive

This has everything I liked about the original, great action, great heart and it was wonderful to have Vin Diesel back in the driver's seat. The logic of the plot was a little fuzzy but overall, I really enjoyed it.

It was refreshing to see Dom and Brian back together again after years apart. The reunion did not seem forced and there were real moments of conflict between the two of them.The car sequences were fantastic as always and the acting greatly improved over the previous films.

In the case of this one, it's not bad per say, it's just remarkably underwhelming, perfectly bland and vanilla. We also get a return of some of the wretched CGI that plagued previous films.The only real memorable part of this movie is that Gal Gadot is in there and to see Wonder Woman popping up in one of these flicks is kinda shocking.

The screenplay writer deserves a special mention here for the superb screenplay.Acting is great and Vin Diesel and Late Paul Walker had again stole the show with their impeccable acting, Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez were average but effective, John Ortiz was not that effective, rest of the cast were decent.

7.0,The Fast and Furious series:Part 4.,"Going with a friend on the opening weekend to the local Odeon to see the unexpected revival of the Fast franchise,I was shocked by how poor the print was, with the final sequence becoming unwatchable, due to how pitch black/dimmed the colours were on the print. As we left, I did wonder if the image would look better on disc.2021: Recently reading about a friend seeing F9 at the cinema,it gave me the final kick to pick up the Blu-Ray, and return to the 4th round of the Fast saga. View on the film: Becoming the in-house director after this who nailed the style of the series with Fast 5,6 and 9, Justin Lin & cinematographer Amir Mokri signal the change in direction for the franchise with a thrilling opening failed heist set-piece. Moving at high speed, Lin places a emphasis in focusing on practical kitsch-Action dive stunts across vehicles performed by Dom's gang, rather then the speed of the sports cars. Breaking the disagreements between Dom and Brian, Lin drives in on up-close Action, with a hard-hitting punch-up between Brian and Dom, which spins into an exciting final set in tunnels, with Lin using the confined location in tight wide-shots to heighten the time crunch atmosphere of the final chase. Making her film debut, Gal Gadot gives a very good, feisty turn as Gisele, whilst Paul Walker brings a urgency to cop Brian's conflict over which to take, and Vin walks round completely unaware of what type of flick he's in, with his deadly serious performance (never change Vin.) Joined by future Suicide Squad (2016-also reviewed) director David Ayer doing uncredited re-writes, the screenplay by Fast regular Chris Morgan and Ayer changes gears at a crossroads, via the set-pieces in Dom's drive for revenge, (a regular major theme across future entries) being over the top, but treated with a serious tone, rather then kitsch, and surprisingly few mentions of ‘Family’ in the dialogue, which instead drives a building of trust between Brian and Dom as drive away fast & furious.",morrison-dylan-fan,2021-08-29,2021,0.068,0.874,0.057,-0.25,Negative

3.0,Very implausible,"This film finally brings us what we were waiting for so much, but it is much less credible than the first ones.In this film the tendency to use the conveniences to get out of the conflict begins, these conveniences end up being implausible and not very credible for the audience, although there is less than in the most recent films of the saga, but even so it does not stop being a resource cheap. The story ends up being boring since it doesn't seem like it's going anywhere or wanting to resolve a conflict, it's just chases or car races, which are even bad due to their horrible editing and mediocre special effects. They introduce new characters but there is no development of them, nor of what happened in the time that has elapsed to the already known characters.Every time the situations that the characters go through and the story to be told are less credible, even the cars go into the background to tell a boring and tedious story.",isaacochoterena,2022-01-03,2022,0.137,0.815,0.048,-0.9551,Negative

At first I was afraid that I would not see Vin Diesel on the screen for a long time again, since his character is in a rather delicate position at the end of the 4th ‘Fast and Furious’, he is in uniform and handcuffs ...

7.0,A return to form for the franchise after losing its way with Tokyo Drift,"Fast & Furious is a solid instalment in the Fast franchise.It benefits from bringing the two best characters in the franchise back together, Vin Diesel's Dom Toretto and Paul Walker's Brian O'Connor.The complicated but blossoming brotherhood between these two men is explored in this film, and this bond and theme of family is a cornerstone of the franchise so it's good to see this being developed.The action sequences and driving stunts are all very enjoyable. A step up from the first few films, but not quite reaching the ludicrousness of later instalments.Justin Lin demonstrates that he really understands this franchise, making an energetic film with a pacey plot, decent twists, and plenty of exhilarating action.All in all this makes for a very fun film, and lets be honest if you are watching a 'Fast' film and are expecting more than just fun then you are barking up the wrong tree.",ethanbresnett,2022-03-26,2022,0.07,0.736,0.194,0.9747,Positive
10.0,one of the best action movies ever made,"This movie is one of my favorites, and starts with a heist in the middle of the mountains with dom and his family.then after the opening we discover letty is missing and brian is a cop again. So in many ways this movie takes place after the first and everybody returns and theres new people in the crew. For me the best scenes are -the audition race, in the night, filmed in locations that look real and everything seems to be happen in a real city(never feels like a movie set) -how dom here is a detective and he finds what happened to letty and why, just visiting the place -the whole third act, when dom and brian are friends again and both try to catch the bad guy in the desert.not only the movie becomes a action movie with alot of nice scenes, you see both brian and dom working togheter, and obviusly now mia is back with brian, and dom have his charger ready to race and go. The music is great, the action feels real, and the drama is really good. Also theres jokes(like when they ask brian how many cars he wants and he say he wants them all)for car fans, dom is seen back in his garage working.he build two cars in the movie.

2.0,lazy and phoned in,"I thought this was the first movie and honestly wanted to see the appeal as in middle school or really early high school it seemed you HAD to see this movie.. well.. I watched the wrong movie first in the series. How did anyone think this was a good idea to call the movie ""fast and furious"" instead of coming up with some clever name. If some other studio put out a movie they'd run to their lawyers and sue.Vin Diesel is so boring in this movie. It's like he doesn't want to be there. He just mumbles through every line for a pay cheque. How could anyone want him to be a leading man? What's his appeal? Does he look ""legit"". He looks like a mixture of Ron Pealman which many of you may know from Sons Of Anarchy or Hellboy. As well as Bruce Willis or Steven Seagal. He can't act to save his life.The plot is so uninspired even if I spoiled it, it doesn't matter, it's that dull where a hundred movies have done a similar plot but better. There are a few cool car chases but it just SCREAMS direct to video especially how many scenes are recycled. They heavily rely on some tunnel. The cars weren't very impressive and the worst thing going for this movie is the dialogue seems like it was written by someones 14 year old son. The last time I saw insults back and forth that bad was in middle school. The cars are forgetful other than the green one the bad guy (i think) drove and of course whatever greasy car Vin could get his mitts on.Skip this one.",talllwoood13,2022-05-25,2022,0.134,0.792,0.074,-0.9694,Negative

Addition of Rock was not very helpful in the story line. May be they should have kept it close to the racing part. The best movie based on racing I believe is Ford vs Ferrari. The detail and story and the need for racing in the first place all made sense. And I believe the F & F 4 was close to it. The need to pass the mountains with time limit made sense and having the best racers was justified for the task.,swapneelshinde,2023-01-27,2023,0.044,0.837,0.119,0.9096,Positive

Now the emphasis is on the criminal component, where the stakes are repeatedly raised, and the heroes will have to learn to live in a new way and go to meet dangerous opponents.The action in the film keeps the viewer's attention from start to finish, and hardcore racing in underground tunnels is simply breathtaking. The creators have put a lot of effort into creating special effects that look very spectacular and convincing.Paul Walker and Vin Diesel once again prove their acting talent and professionalism by playing their roles at the highest level. They create convincing images that will not leave any viewer indifferent. Their interaction and the dynamics of their relationship create a real chemistry on the screen, and this makes the film even more fascinating and interesting. We will see the confrontation and tension between the heroes, because the current situation allows only one of them to succeed, despite the fact that each of the heroes has their own motivation and there is no way to step back in their aspirations.Unfortunately, the main villain of the film was not impressed. His predecessor looked much more convincing in the second part of the gasoline saga. The antagonist's assistant, with whom the hero of Diesel Dominic Toretto has his own scores, looks much more convincing. It is this confrontation that is of particular interest. But the main thing in the film is wild racing and high stakes, where every mistake behind the wheel and outside it can be decisive for the characters.The acting of Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster is undoubtedly one of the main advantages of the film. They managed to create that inexplicable charm, thanks to which the viewer simply falls in love with the characters. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are an integral part of the franchise, and their tandem has long been one of the main symbols of the cult saga.One of the main advantages of ""Fast and Furious 4"" is its visual performance. The film was shot very beautifully and qualitatively, with beautiful landscapes and incredible tricks that amaze the imagination. The color palette is ready to please the viewer. At some point we will see bright chases in broad daylight, and in another case we will enjoy the dark dungeons through which the characters of the picture will drive. Director Justin Lin coped with his work at the highest level, creating a fascinating and exciting atmosphere that does not allow the viewer to relax for a minute. He has already staged a good ""Tokyo Drift"", and the man has several more pictures about ""Fast and Furious"" ahead of him. And each subsequent film will be much more amazing than the previous one.In general, ""Fast and Furious 4"" is a great movie that is definitely worth watching for all fans of the genre. It contains all the necessary elements to become a real hit: an excellent plot, spectacular stunts, good acting and beautiful visualization. This is really one of the best films in the series, which will not leave anyone indifferent.9 out of 10.",alekspredator87,2023-04-27,2023,0.057,0.72,0.222,0.9988,Positive
7.0,Real franchise starter,"This is probably the first film from the franchise I saw and it does feel like this is setting up to be a real franchise while the three films before all kind of felt stand-alone in some way. This is as good as the first one in my opinion even though it moves away from what made the first one a bit special and leaned into the more glossy aspects but it works very very well here. The action setpieces are all wonderfully done but the editing bogs this down a bit. It kinda felt like they are too focused on making it feel tightly packed that they edited out a lot of important stuff. The last chase scene especially felt a bit weird with the editing and there were many moments where the events and timeline felt a bit off which I assume is due to editing out stuff that should've been in there. But it is a very entertaining movie and if not for the editing issue, I would have put it above the first one.This is also where the retconning in the franchise started. Han came back to show Tokyo Drift would be happening after this. But that event and all the main character motivations in this movie coming back in the future to get retconned again seems really lazy from here when I think about it because when I saw them randomly I didn't even remember most of it. Let's see how the franchise holds up now.",Jithindurden,2023-04-27,2023,0.021,0.88,0.099,0.9656,Positive

8.0,Keeps getting better and better,"The saga continues to improve with the return of the original cast and Justin Lin who is directing his second film in the series after 'Tokyo Drift'. The screen story is also more developed by abandoning the puerile tone of the beginnings in favor of a more mature story, which is developed into a classical action film, solidly acted by Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, John Ortiz, Laz Alonso and Gal Gadot in her acting debut.

8.0,Solid Action Movie,"The subsequent films in the Fast and the Furious series always have more thrill and action than the preceding film. As is customary, the movie's opening sequence bursts onto the screen with the most action and tension. The first-scene action makes it possible for viewers to fixate on the screen the entire time. It was the best in the franchise so far, I was actually surprised with how much plot was in this movie and there seemed to be more importance focused on the story. The acting was better than any of the other 3. For any fast and the furious fans this is not a let down but another awesome film.",IPyaarCinema,2023-05-12,2023,0.051,0.81,0.138,0.872,Positive

The first film was fresh and exciting and I just came out of theatres after watching Fast X and my respect for this movie has increased. This movie was 100x better than the recent movies in the fast and furious franchise. Totally recommended to watch. Thumbs up from my side. A great beginning of a journey. All the characters played equal and important roles, it was comedic with action at the same time. Good old times. If you want to witness the journey of Dom, this is where you exactly begin.

5.0,It's a decent movie.,"They put way too much emphasis on nitrous oxide in all the races. But if you've had any experience at all with cars or street racing, you know that nitrous oxide isn't all that the movie makes it out to be. You don't simply turn it one whenever you want to win or accelerate at random. It's really sad that they don't focus on the cars themselves more.To all the others. Please only review the movie itself. Don't simply complain about ads. Ads are advertisements. Advertisements are commercials. Commercials are commerce and commerce is money. They need money to make the game so complaining about ads is just a waste of everyone's time.",dbarr123,2023-05-21,2023,0.087,0.818,0.095,-0.0191,Neutral

7.0,Great stunts in this action packed FNF entry that goes back to what made this series gold.,"This is the fourth entry in the Fast and The Furious franchise and it really goes back to five years after the first film revisiting our favorite characters Dom, Brian, Letty, Mia and we see Han again. The on screen chemistry or camaraderie is still there between Brian and Dom...and Brian and Mia.Brian has his FBI job back and the cops are hot on Dom, so Dom leaves Letty who ends up dead. Dom comes to Letty's LA funeral and goes after her killer. This puts him on a collision course with Brian who is also trying to take down a big time drug dealer named Braga.There are more great driving stunts and just some great stunts altogether...fight scenes, explosions...and definitely some great cars, all held together with a thrilling soundtrack.Dominican Republic, Mexico and LA are all backdrops for this great fast and furious reunion. This might be my second favorite film (next to the first) in the series thus far.",cgvsluis,2023-05-29,2023,0.117,0.736,0.147,0.7946,Positive
5.0,Disjointed,"Despite this film being the first time Dom and Bryan reunite since the first film, this film leaves a lot to be desired. Letti's death is emotional and enough motivation to drive Dom and the film. But I felt it could have had more of a plot or additional storylines to make more interesting. Also Dom, despite being a stoic character, does not show the audience he's that affected. We don't see enough emotion and intensity that supposedly exists. The action scenes are also a bit of a let down and insults the viewers intelligence. We see some unrealistic action scenes and a lot of plot armour that shields the main characters and villains. Overall the film felt disjointed and it abruptly transitioned from one scene to another and a lot plot points could have been explained better, the viewer had to quickly piece these together to assume what was going on. A weak entry in the franchise.",Kingslaay,2023-05-31,2023,0.114,0.796,0.09,-0.7514,Negative
7.0,Time to Race! (Again!),"Review:It's really more of the same stuff from the first three movies with the cars. So nothing really new. However I am glad that we finally got an actual direct sequel to the Original movie with The Four Main Stars returning (Diesel, Walker, Rodriguez, and Brewster) Takeaways: -The Four main characters of the first movie are back and reunited!! Yay! Well that's actually a little misleading, because SPOILER........................................ Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is seemingly shot and killed in the first 10 minutes of the movie! This of course sets that whole plot in motion, and causes Brian Dominic and Mia to reunite to track down the guy responsible -The whole cast is great again, and it's like they never even left! -Vin Diesel is Back!!! Dominic Torretto was still Street racing and still robbing things with Letty. They have been hiding in the Dominican Republic with new comrade Han Lue (a returning Sung Kang. This movie took place before his death in Movie 3.) however Dom is angry after Letty is killed and he is going after the man who killed her for vengeance. He strikes a deal with Brian O'Connor to help bust the criminal operation that Letty's killer is a part of, and in exchange, Brian will make sure Dom gets a pardon and pass from prison for his help. Dom doesn't care about not running, until he finds out that Letty was secretly working with Brian to get Dom's Criminal record wiped, by investigating the crime gang. That was what May have gotten her killed. -Also from this point Foward, Vin Diesel is now one of the guardians of the franchise. Vin Diesel has more involvement with the franchise as series Producer and not just as a Star. -Paul Walker nails it again as Brian! Brian O'Connor is now an FBI Agent tracking down the car crime gang, responsible for Letty's murder. He must also redeem himself in the eyes of the family that he betrayed. At first Dom and Mia want nothing to do with him, because he broke their trust years ago, when he revealed that he was an undercover cop investigating them. When they all team up to get Justice for Letty, Brian eventually reconciles with both of them and he also restarts his relationship with Mia. -Gal Gadot debuts as Street racer Giselle Yashar. -I love that Dom and Brian had a Race Rematch. Though we don't know who actually won lol. -Letty is avenged when Dom shoots down her murderer. He then decides that he is Done with running and with crime, and turns himself in, with the hopes that Brian can fulfill his end of the bargain and clear him. The ending was sad when, the Judge could not fulfill Brian's request and give Don freedom and he sentences Dom to a long time in prison. Brian is furious that the Justice system failed Dom, so he and Mia decide to bust him out of the prison transport. As a result all three of them are now in hiding. Conclusion: it is a sequel that puts a step step in the right direction, and starts a good action packed Brian/Dom/Letty storyline that concludes with the 7th film.",myblueblazer,2023-06-01,2023,0.164,0.726,0.11,-0.9912,Negative
10.0,Fast and furious awesome franchise,"Fast & Furious (2009) is an awesome Action packed sequel, where The Fast and the Furious (2001) stopped. This is the real sequel to The Fast and The Furious. I love that Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster reprise their roles back to the roots the way they were. This is my fourth favorite best film in the series, this film Is a seat to the edge from the beginning till the end. This movie kept me thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. Sure it's a little far fetched, but who cares? It's a movie, and definitely not as bad as some people are saying. Besides, the point of watching a movie is to escape reality so I don't understand why people complain when movies are not realistic. Provided a cinematic equivalent of NOS to the franchise with a tone shift that helped make it one of the most popular and profitable action series in the last decade. Excellent flick. Much better than the middle two. Just forget those movies happened. This was good balls to the walls action with much better actors with the original 4 back together. Bad idea making 2 and 3 :) Vin Diesel and Paul Walker re team with Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster for the ultimate chapter of the franchise built on speed! When fugitive Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) returns to Los Angeles to avenge a loved one's death, it reignites his feud with agent Brian O'Conner (Walker). But, as they race through crowded city streets and across international lines, they must test their loyalties by joining together to bring down a shared enemy. From big rig heists to precision tunnel crawls, Fast & Furious takes you back into the high-octane world, which lives for speed, drives for the rush and breaks all the rules! ‘Maybe you're the bad guy pretending to be the good guy.’ This film is more about stopping a notorious drug lord Arturo Braga and avenging the murder of Letty (Michelle Rodriguez). This film is set back in Los Angles when everything started, after 5.years of leaving the city of Angeles for Dominican Republic after Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew become a Wanted Fugitives. Letty was murdered when she was mixed up in a drug racers mule cartel. She knew the people who hired her, will double crossed her, while trying to escape the flying bullets she was killed by a drug lord's henchman. That weary angrier Dom (Vin Diesel) brings him back to Los Angeles, to avenge his loved one's death and tracking down Drug Lord Braga and killing him. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), is now an FBI agent, and he is assigned to track down a notorious drug lord named Arturo Braga. Both men faces each other in a final showdown. Braga is looking for a fast drivers that are driving and smuggling trough desert New Mexico drugs. Brian goes again undercover only to find out that he and Dom (Vin Diesel) are been double crossed and set up on the same way that was Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) was. This film is filled with full action, fast cars, full of stunts and beautiful women. Gal Gadot is tremendous as Gisele Harabo it was her first role in this film and she was awesome, she acted the character terrific. Paul walker was the best in this film, finally, finally they did something with the character, he become an FBI Agent which I love that with the character In this movie. I love that Dom (Vin Diesel) at the end of the film didn't run, he surrender and I love how Brian ( Paul Walker) was testifying for him in the court. Seriously this film Kicks ass, although I prefer Fast Five over this Action Flick, but that doesn't mean this film did not do the job right, it did! And this film is highly underrated and criticized by critics. Also Han (Sung Kang) has a small scene in the beginning of this film, that was before they killed the beloved character in The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006).",ka-09820,2023-06-03,2023,0.138,0.716,0.147,0.7763,Positive

6.0,I know it'll get better than this but I was somewhat let down...,"I'm watching all of these movies since my friend recommended them to me since Fast X just came out. The first two were just okay, and so was this one. I just couldn't really get that into it. While this may not be the case with some people, I find these characters to be mostly shallowly written and I just don't really care about them. The action in these films is easily the best thing about them, and there were a couple of pretty cool scenes with Vin Diesel toward the end which I enjoyed. I also liked the presence of some actresses like Gal Gadot and Jordana Brewster too. That's about it though, but I'll try to keep watching. I know that the action at least can for sure get better and better!

They clearly realize that these movies are better off with the same people,in the second one it was only Paul Walker with a main role and in the third the cast is completely different. I found this one much better,even better than the first in my opinion,it seems more mature and focuses more on a good story rather than just good car chases,don't worry though,there's plenty of time for that as well. Clearly the Fast and Furious movies can only continue with Vin Diesel and Paul Walker,and from this one forward they realize that,and the fifth only improves. Fans of the first Fast and Furious will be very pleased with this installment.",yasin-35462,2023-06-22,2023,0.086,0.698,0.216,0.9599,Positive
6.0,Sporting Braga,"Fascinatingly, after two sequels with lower budgets and diminishing returns, for whatever reason, the Fast and Furious franchise switches gears (pun intended) and starts us down the road towards the wild and crazy world we're in now. This one is still relatively tame, but watchable enough.When Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is killed, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) returns to Los Angeles to investigate. Also investigating is Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) who is now an FBI agent looking into the operations of a Drug Kingpin Braga whom Letty was working for when she died. Both Brian and Dom attempt to infiltrate the cartel, using Ramon (John Ortiz) who finds drivers for Braga, as their route in. There is only one spot on the team though, and they must race to decide who gets it.So yes, it's all still relatively lacklustre at this point. They're no longer knocking of DVD players, but the villains are still just drug dealers rather than limitless international terrorist organisations. Dom's already getting into superhero mode though, as he's shot at one point in this and just shrugs it off. Despite saying it's relatively grounded there are three characters in this film who will come back from the dead at some point in the series! There main four characters are all back though, along with Han, who heads off to Tokyo after the opening scene - making this a prequel to Tokyo Drift - an idea which was again retconned later on. Gal Godot joins the cast as Gisele though there's little in this particular performance to suggest that she would be coming back again after the end of this plot. Laz Alonso is also in the film, as Braga's right hand man Fenix and though he has a memorable death, he gets to do a lot more as Mother's Milk in ""The Boys"".Even with all that awful Pitbull Music, the film isn't bad and is watchable enough. The stunts are getting better and the characters are starting to accumulate into ""the family"" that will feature in the next six films.

This is where we see the change from a plot that involves street racing to something much bigger, but we are still not presented with more intense action. This is the big problem with the fourth film in the franchise. He cannot maintain the simplicity of the previous ones, but he does not risk the megalomania of the later ones. The film focuses on a drama that cannot carry. Everything that tries to be dramatic in the narrative becomes clumsy. The direction doesn't handle the drama well, the actors don't have the capacity to do it and the entire atmosphere that tries to have a more dramatic and serious aura becomes just cheesy. The film is saved by a few good action scenes that make the experience not a complete disaster, however, there isn't much to save in the film.",claszdsburrogato,2024-01-08,2024,0.065,0.827,0.108,0.8207,Positive
6.0,Step into Hollywood action.,"""Fast & Furious"" (2009) revitalizes the franchise with a shift towards a more polished Hollywood action, diverging from its street-racing roots. This installment reunites Dom, Mia, and Brian, deepening the series' cherished family theme amidst a backdrop of high-octane chases and dramatic heists. While the ending may tread into cheesy territory, it doesn't detract from the film's overall appeal, which cleverly balances the thrill of action with the warmth of character connections. This blend of elements signals a new direction for the franchise, embracing broader cinematic thrills while staying true to its core values of family and loyalty.",schmittfalte,2024-02-24,2024,0.05,0.749,0.201,0.9493,Positive
5.0,Not the worst but enough bad,"After watching the prequel who is "" Tokyo drift "" who it was very not bad this third opus or this four opus from the franchise it was very disappointing for my opinion.You meet again finally our first protagonist from the franchise debut that was very nice but the script was not gripping then all reason cause the main topic of this film was interesting but I didn't hit the feeling of an entertainment story telling...You getting sometime very boring in front this movie like the secondary opus and often you are losing about the bad character who is him, who is who is disappointedSometimes you are the feeling that is most a cop movie with car than movie car, is disappointedThe action scene are nice but I was the feeling that it was different that usually like you noticed more that fake explosion unlike the precedent opus for me the Vfx was not good but such entertainment scenes of action and it's nice to see back Los Angeles !",tomlaju,2024-04-25,2024,0.111,0.732,0.158,0.8287,Positive
8.0,overhated,"""Fast & Furious"" is slightly below the levels of the first three films. Everyone says that this fourth chapter of the saga is a total flop, a bad movie...but I say the opposite. For me Fast and Furious 4 is a great movie, fun and never boring. This is the first film of the new era of the saga, no longer focused on illegal car racing but rightly implements a great change: it becomes an action film, with shootings and much more, always giving more space to cars. According to many the choice to make the saga become an action franchise is bad but I think it's perfect: imagine a saga that for 10 movies always brings the same story about the illegality of motor racing. Well, I would say that it would be quite boring. The plot of the film is the thing that convinced me the least, I think it loses a lot compared to previous films. In contrast, however, I loved the difficult situation that there is between the family Toretto and Brian, but with a nice journey together during the film: the two are a phenonemal couple and together they work perfectly. I also loved the dramatic side of the film with Toretto tight-knit by the police about to get to him. I really liked the direction of Justin Lin that after ""Tokyo drift"" reconfirms with excellent action scenes. I think Vin Diesel improves his performance and with him Brian becomes even better in my opinion. I liked the inclusion of Gisele played by the beautiful Gal Gadot. I liked the film's antagonist, Braga, played well by John Ortiz. The film's photography is still excellent in this fourth chapter. The ending of the film really gets me excited about the fifth film, which I can't wait to see again..

7.0,Gets the franchise back on track,"After a pretty good debut movie with The Fast and The Furious the two follow-ups were steps back for me. Here the franchise gets started again for what we now know it for. Decision to bring both Brian and Dom back is what makes this one really work. While the villains aren't as strong here, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker really make this fun to watch with the dynamic the two are having. The twist with who is Braga isn't quite pulled off here, I thought this was really predictable but still the car chases and action scenes here are fun and make me look away from the little flaws the story has. So this really was about getting back in form for the three great movies coming next to the franchise.",tk_ew,2024-05-30,2024,0.046,0.829,0.125,0.9127,Positive

6.0,The self-titled film in the Fast & Furious franchise.,"Fast & Furious is the springboard that takes the series from being a trilogy focusing on car culture to an over-the-top, juggernaut action film franchise. A litmus test to see if viewers are ready to leave ""grounded"" action behind and buckle in for some super-human-type action that prioritizes badassery above all.The plot is a mess, even by Fast & Furious standards, but the plot is far from the most important aspect of making a great Fast & Furious film. It does feel unique from others as it features the most tension between Brian and Dom, while also giving us a Detective Dom acting like Batman.",mediatation,2024-06-20,2024,0.127,0.744,0.13,0.34,Positive
6.0,Fast & Furious - Jamison Slabaugh,A fun thrilling ride as per usual for The Fast and Furious franchise. This film has some minor pacing issues and makes a few mistakes when it comes to plot decisions. I think the plot was really strong in the first half of the film with the surprise of Letty's death. You start to see the friendship and the bond that Brian and Dom used to have reform until the tense that builds when we realize that Letty was working for Brian and Dom freaks out. I think it was a great use of tension until they didn't continue anything with it once the scene cut away. The love story of Brian and Mia in this film is very weak as we don't see anything about how that reforms we just see them randomly start making out in the kitchen. The antagonist is basic and weak in my opinion. We know nothing about him besides he is a drug dealer and he is the reason Letty is dead. He should've had more depth in my opinion. I'm also not sure why these films seem to clock out at 1 hour and 45 minutes instead of taking a few more scenes and giving some more depth to these characters. That or cut down some of the unnecessary junk and replace it with depth. Stop giving us John Wick antagonists. Dom on the other hand has some good development as he finally decides to stop running. Brian decides to finally get his own code straight and start helping his friends and family. Other than that the cinematography in this film is definitely at an all time high for the franchise. The score has also improved. 6/10 STARS.,jamisonslabaugh,2024-07-06,2024,0.131,0.732,0.138,0.6707,Positive
6.0,"""I'm a boy who appreciates a good body, regardless of the make.""","FILM: 6.5
Rewatching the 2009 film Fast and Furious, I find myself with mixed feelings about it. This film was touted as a return to form with the original cast back on board. They do elevate it, but I've never been a huge fan of this film as it misses the heart that made the first work so well.One thing I do appreciate is seeing Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, and Jordana Brewster back together. Their chemistry and familiarity bring a certain energy to the film that's hard to deny. However, the storyline doesn't give them as much character development as I'd like. John Ortiz does well as the villain, but it's a shame the main characters don't get as much development.The action sequences are thrilling, and the CGI chases are visually impressive. Yet, as a whole, heart got swapped for CGI and it affects the film a little. The film leans heavily on its high-octane set pieces, sometimes at the expense of the emotional depth that made the first film so compelling. While the action is enjoyable, it feels like something is missing.Despite these shortcomings, it's still an enjoyable way to pass the time. The film manages to keep me entertained with its fast pace and flashy visuals. I also appreciate how this instalment leads to some very entertaining films later on. It sets the stage for the franchise to evolve into the global phenomenon it is today.There are scenes that hint at the deeper connections between characters, even if they're not fully explored. The film's soundtrack also adds to the overall experience, enhancing the high-energy atmosphere.Overall, Fast and Furious is a fairly middling entry in the series that delivers on action but falls short on character development and emotional resonance. While it's not my favourite, it's still a decent film that paves the way for more exciting adventures in the franchise. Your mileage may vary.FORMAT: Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.0

6.0,Sloppy fun,"I have to be honest - I watched this back-to-back with Fast Five, and that one was kind of amazing, to the point where I now struggle to remember much of what happened in Fast & Furious (AKA the fourth movie in the series). But I still thought it was a pretty decent watch, and arguably the point where the series becomes what it's best known for being. It feels like a proper sequel to the original movie, in contrast to 2 Fast 2 Furious and Tokyo Drift, which almost feel more like spin-offs to the original, in hindsight.It's fascinating watching the series kind of take shape. There are still more old-school car races in this one, and probably the best scene in the film is still a race. But there are hints at the series becoming more here, with those hints paying off in a huge way in the kind of amazing Fast Five. It's a great warm-up for that film, introducing a few characters who'll go on to play a part there, while also bringing the characters of the first movie back together; back onto the same playing field.It is somewhat awkwardly assembled, and certainly has its flaws as an individual movie. But I can already see it as a necessary stepping stone for the Fast and Furious series as a whole. Honestly, even with it being messy, I still think I liked it more than the first and third movies (of the original four, 2 Fast 2 Furious is still the best, though. Guess I'll die on that hill.).",Jeremy_Urquhart,2024-07-26,2024,0.096,0.682,0.222,0.9927,Positive
5.0,I have rarely felt so few emotions while watching a movie,"Fast and Furious = 5/10Fast and Furious is a kind of new beginning for the film series and now focuses more on a gangster plot than on pure racing, which the film only implements so mediocrely.Vin Diesel, as the face of the franchise, plays emotionless as always, but has a good dynamic with Paul Walker. The remaining characters are not worth mentioning as they have no charm or good dialogue.The plot is average. Dom tries to find his girlfriend's murderer and the film always tries to include action scenes with cars in order to find an argument why the film is set in the Fast and Furious franchise.The car action, especially the first part of the film, is sometimes really fun and exciting, but suffers from too hectic editing and poorly directed camera work.So this film sinks into absolute mediocrity, it's not incredibly bad but it's definitely not good either. The characters are too poorly written, the plot is too thin and the car scenes are surprisingly poorly done, even if they are fun to watch.It's hard to say anything at all about this film because it hardly triggers any emotions, it's not special in any way.But the film takes a new direction and delivers some fast-paced car scenes.",alexanderpratl,2024-09-14,2024,0.156,0.717,0.127,-0.6548,Negative
5.0,They had to make something,I don't know what they were thinking with the 3 rd movie it was boring and bland the whole story line was trying something different that was a flop then getting back to what an show the movie should be but this one is still off because of way he leaves everyone to be by himself and then letty starts randomly working for a drug lord that doesn't seem like something they would get involved with.his sister Mia is bland and boring someone else definitely should have played that part vin deisel is half black but he alway seems to avoid having black family in anything he plays he will play any other race but that similar to the rock who embraces his Samoan race but never his black side.the funeral was nothing of importance may as well have not been part of the movie there's no real emotions behind her death at all she was murdered and vin diesel is bland and dry as usual he besides driving the cars vin deisel brings nothing to these movies but a robotic presence Paul walker with all the rest of the cast make the movie. Paul walker always brought a natural presence to all the movies he shows the emotions when needed the toughness the love the bad boy or the cop.he's versatile .its hard to watch the ones he's not in the girls with no clothes get air beat over the top we know everyone loves to exploit woman sex sales draw the crept men in to watch but there's never a element of sexy men for woman this was made to be a guys movie.,tamrbrwn-59647,2024-09-25,2024,0.141,0.752,0.108,-0.7894,Negative
8.0,The best Fast and Furious film so far,"I remember last time I reviewed Fast and Furious 7, I mentioned that how I ended up watching this franchise. After I watched film 1-7 , I was clearly thinking that this film is not only the best film in the franchise, but it is also one of my most favourite film in recent years. The story: The story is like traditional buddy cop formula. It involves Dominic, who recently find out Letty has been killed in a car crash, investigating who is the culprit behind the incident. On the way, he meet back Brian, who is finding a drug lord, and let both of them in a street race. Dominic and Brian, which are still having issues for each other, meet Fenix, and Dominic find out that he is the one who killed Letty. He team up with Brian to hunt down Fenix, but the plan fails first time. They then get help and get Braga back to border, and kill Fenix on the way. Dominic do not escape and get sentenced while Brian decide to stay back with him. The storyline is pretty basic, but it is really entertaining and unique in a spy film. The relations between each elements is fluent and cohesive as well. From how Dominic and Brian reunite, to how street race affect the plan, and how Letty is related to Brian. The street race and dramatic scenes are really a standard yet unique storyline in films belong to same genre. I felt focused and enjoyed during the whole movie, which is why this movie has one of the best stories in the franchise as a whole. The visuals: The scene are very fluent and clearly, which is on par with industrial standards. What really stand out is that the flashbacks are really transparent with the present situation, and the explosions are one of the better ones in the films I watched. The car chase scenes are really convincing and motived, and I liked the overall dark photography, which the cars and actions are still clear while at the dark, and reflecting on how Dominic feel at that moment. Overall, those visuals are average but some unique moments from the view of director Justin Lin and convincing explosions really bring the whole movie become more colourful to look at. The characters: The characters in this film really stand out from the whole franchises. I really liked the chemistry between Dominic and Brian, and felt like both of them are the main characters. Dominic is interesting in this film. He uses his mean and revengeful personality to help defeat Fenix, and is less annoying than the further installments when he would form a group called ‘family’. Brian is dynamic and serious in this film, which helped enhancing the chemistry between him and Dominic and justified how they end up caring each other, while also brought his charisma back in the film. Fenix and Braga is a threat enough to bring both of the men in trouble and making Brian looked vulnerable, which is a good sign for a franchise increasingly solidify each main characters. Mia and Gisele also helped the main character to defeat Fenix, and their characters really merged into the film seamlessly. The characters is this film are really fused together, and each of them is interesting in their own way, and brought me no annoyance whatsoever, which bring this film stand out from the whole franchise. Verdict: The film did not let me feeling bored during the screen time, which is outstanding compared to other films in the franchise. The story is unique and a good blend between how the film established in and new genre translation. The visuals is good among the industry. What I like the most is the characters, especially the patching up between Dominic and Brian, and let both of them being hurt by both mentally and physically, really convincing they they are the main characters that are interesting. I am never a fan of a certain actor, including Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, but I will defend them if someone told me that they are not a good actor in this film. I still feel that Paul Walker himself is behind me, but this is the best film for his character, and is the best film from the character portrayed by his buddy Vin Diesel, and is one the the best film I have seen to date.

6.0,Decent,"Fast & Furious (2009), the fourth installment in the Fast and Furious franchise, brings back the original cast and a grittier tone after the more standalone third film. The reunion of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker is a highlight, as their chemistry helps rekindle the dynamic that fans loved from the first movie. The action sequences are well-executed, with high-speed chases and adrenaline-pumping stunts that keep viewers on the edge of their seats.However, while the film delivers in terms of spectacle, it falls short in other areas. The plot is formulaic, with the revenge storyline feeling somewhat predictable and lacking depth. The character development is minimal, and the emotional stakes don't quite land as effectively as they should. Some scenes feel more like a setup for future installments rather than fully realized moments within this one.Overall, Fast & Furious is an entertaining watch, especially for fans of the series, but it doesn't quite hit the same high notes as the original. It's a decent chapter in the franchise, but it doesn't stand out as one of the best. 6/10.",Bmore-Hero,2024-10-17,2024,0.047,0.82,0.134,0.9243,Positive

4.0,The first of these films to be worse than I remember.,"Fast and Furious (2009) is the ramp to what the series would become. From films about racing cars, to action-packed heist ridiculousness. As such, it suffers a great deal. We have a film that's trying so hard to be serious, and in that very same film we have Detective Dominic recreate a car crash and shooting in his mind just from tracks.What's even worse is that the later entries in the franchise retroactively make this film nearly pointless, turning it into a bombastic vehicle to introduce and reintroduce mainstay characters. But I won't take that part into account for this review, it's more a failing of the entire franchise.Fortunately there's some good parts. Less CGI and actual stunts, even if they are completely stupid, make the action more enjoyable to watch. It was also nice to see the characters we learned about in the first film finally interact with each other again, after their brief spin-off sojourns.But, it's not enough to make this film enjoyable for me. The other movies are at least a lot of fun. This one is dour and miserable by comparison. Thankfully, the film after this one is probably the best in the series.",H4wke,2024-11-05,2024,0.112,0.754,0.135,0.8897,Positive
8.0,A Fitting End to the 2000s Fast and Furious Era,"Fast & Furious (2009), the fourth installment of the popular franchise, serves as a thrilling last hurrah for the 2000s era while paving the way for what the series has become in the 2010s and beyond (still debating whether this is a good thing or bad thing). The film brings back fan-favorite characters Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster), and Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) after their absence in the third movie, Tokyo Drift.The plot revolving around Letty's (Michelle Rodriguez) ""death"" and the rekindling of Brian's romantic relationship with Mia is an intriguing premise that keeps the audience engaged. Additionally, the film explores the complex relationship between Brian and Dom, which adds depth to the story. The introduction of Giselle (Gal Gadot) as a new character also proves to be a welcome addition to the series.One aspect of the film that left me slightly confused was Mia's anger towards Brian for tearing her family apart. Given her lack of contact with him since 2001, it seemed unfair for her to place the blame solely on him. However, this minor issue does not detract significantly from the overall enjoyment of the movie.The film balances the grounded storyline with the inclusion of the FBI and high-profile organizations and agencies. The action sequences and stunts, a staple of the franchise, are well-executed and contribute to the adrenaline-pumping experience.In conclusion, while Fast & Furious (2009) may not be one of my personal favorite in the franchise, it is still a highly entertaining and solid addition to the series. It serves as an excellent end to the 2000s era of the Fast and Furious saga and sets the stage for the more over-the-top and action-packed sequels to come.",douglasc11,2025-01-04,2025,0.109,0.782,0.109,-0.0645,Negative
6.0,Maybe the first true sequel in the Franchise,"The rating may be a bit skewed because of how frustrating it was for me to watch this one instead of the original when I decided to dive back into this franchise. The name of this movie being so close to the original when really it is the 4th movie in the series is a little annoying, but then it sort of made sense because it is the first one that truly feels like a sequel. The last two movies had different characters and different storylines, but this one goes back to the basics and does it well. The only reason I knocked it down a point from the original is because it is just so similar, but lacks some of the dramatic complexities from the first movie. However, if you are looking for this one to scratch that itch the first movie gave you, it is an excellent choice. Some of the driving sequences in this one are really great.",jaredlemin,2025-01-08,2025,0.02,0.831,0.149,0.9763,Positive
7.0,The Tough Race: The Return of Slaps and Screeching Tires,"Vin Diesel is back, and this time, he's not here to ask questions or take selfies with Paul Walker. No, here he's growling, speeding, and tearing up the asphalt like speed traps never existed. This fourth installment feels like seeing your ex who's been hitting CrossFit: tougher, more serious, and thankfully, with less of the childish antics from before.Paul Walker, bless him, is like that friend who always tags along, but you're never quite sure why. He's not bad, but let's be real, he's not carrying this franchise on his shoulders. That's Diesel's job. Walker's the clean-cut sidekick who does his part while Diesel saves the franchise with uppercuts and wheelies.This Fast & Furious feels like an evolution: less flashy neon lights, fewer girls twerking on hoods, and more ground-shaking races like a kaiju stomping out of the ocean. It leans harder into being an action movie rather than just a car show-off competition. That newfound maturity is refreshing, though it might make die-hard fans of the OG ""vroom-vroom"" era shed a tear or two.You can tell Justin Lin wanted to calm things down and give the story some substance. Toretto isn't just a guy who drives fast anymore; now he's a man with trauma, a thirst for revenge, and some deeper reflections. Don't get too excited-it's not Bergman-level introspection-but hey, at least the engines aren't the only thing filling the air.The final chase? A high-octane firework show. It's like Michael Bay on steroids, except the explosions actually have a purpose this time. The action makes you sweat like you're strapped to the hood of a Supra flying down the highway of doom at 250 km/h.This fourth installment is Fast & Furious going dark and mature while still keeping the heart-pounding excitement that fans crave. It smells like grease, vengeance, and family-the Toretto house special. If you're looking for something heavy and aren't afraid of getting hit by a monster truck tire, this one's for you.",OniFR,2025-02-05,2025,0.073,0.8,0.126,0.9439,Positive
