0,8,"""This is vehicular warfare.""","I don't think many other franchises has been as turbulent and uneven as The Fast and the Furious films. Things started off pretty earnestly with Rob Cohen's first film, but quickly careened into odd directions, with the ever-cheesy 2 Fast 2 Furious taking off and running with one main character while leaving the other in the dust, and with Tokyo Drift drifting away with totally different characters altogether. Thankfully, Fast & Furious realigned the series with its roots. But it wasn't until Fast Five when I really began to give a darn about this series. Granted that all films have had their fun moments, the fifth film magically tied in every single strand from every single film, and made every single character relevant. Best of all, it did so with a great sense of fun: it had great pacing, amusing comedy, great action, and it made the characters stand out as a collectively outstanding cast.So now Fast & Furious 6 has come out, reuniting the entire gang once more to take on bigger stakes. The spectacle in this film tries its best to be even bigger, more absurd, and more awesome than before: the film is effectively book-ended with two massive action setpieces. The first involves a decently destructive car chase in London, where the villain effectively uses his custom-built ride to launch other cars all over the place. The film's final act features a really crazy sequence in which a tank roars across a highway, crushing other cars and blowing up bridges. This all culminates with all the muscle cars banding together to bring down a massive cargo plane in a fiery blaze of glory. In between, the film slows down a bit, but there's frequent fist-fights and pursuits, a few scenes of witty comedy, and there's one decent car-racing scene.Whether or not you really dig this film may depend on how well you dig the characters and all their dynamics. It definitely helps to watch and understand the events of the first five films, because at this point, they've all been through so much and changed so much; for a late-comer like me, who never was invested in the characters until the last film, it can be confusing to remember who was who and what their history was. Fortunately, the film does insert some flashbacks and reminders for the audience's benefit. If you are keeping up with things, then the film will reward you with a cast of endearing and heartfelt characters, and the film's plot generally revolves around their continuing struggles. As far as the actual plot goes, it's pretty brainless and absurd action-movie fodder, and there are plot holes to be found. However, the film does have the merit of presenting a cast of villains to directly oppose the cast of heroes, and the story pulls out a few surprising twists.The film generally looks good, but many of the action scenes are hectically shot and edited, and it can be hard to tell what's going on in certain scenes. What you can see is awesome, but sometimes, it's just aggravating. Acting is generally fun and enjoyable from the whole cast. Writing gets the job done well enough. This production uses a plethora of quality sets, props, and costumes, with loads of flashy cars at its disposal, and some okay-looking special effects. This film uses some cool hip rap and techno music, while the music score is pretty cool (sounds a lot like Brian Tyler's work from Tokyo Drift, which was one of my favorite soundtracks).Best recommended to fans of the series, especially if you've been following the last few movies.4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)",Al_The_Strange,5/24/13,2013
1,8,A big movie and a fun time!,"Well, this was unexpected! Going into this film I found myself with no hype at all. I expected a good, fun and cheesy movie time and I came out of the theater happy and surprised. While this isn't a masterpiece of filmmaking it does achieve what it sets out to do. To entertain you. And it does this quite good and sometimes it goes further than this by showing us some amazing set pieces and action sequences. For example one car, tank chase sequence! This is achieved by the gigantic production value of the film. You can literally smell the money that comes out of these guys. The whole movie you have this sense of scale, and I mean BIG scale! The amazing sound mixing and design including the music pumps you up and puts you in the mood! While the acting isn't Oscar worthy it is very fluid and it doesn't always feel forced. The chemistry between the cast is very solid and credible. Diesel and ""The Rock"" where pretty solid along with the secondary characters, and the villain was surprisingly tolerable. Another thing that solidifies the movie are the effects. These are outstanding along with the camera-work! The things that brought the movie down for me a little bit where some of the stunts, and weirdly some of these I found pretty amazing but although I understand this movie isn't supposed to be taken seriously there were some stunts that were just plain unbelievable, specially in the third act of the movie. And finally, the plot. While not groundbreaking it did have its interesting points but it doesn't drift away from the cheese factors. Overall I was quite surprised by what this movie did and how the director and producers exploited and used their huge production value. This is an example of a good quality action flick.",pablo2896,5/24/13,2013
4,7,Movin' on up!,"While most franchises lose their steam with each succeeding sequel, the Fast and the Furious franchise is that rare exception where its later films breathe in new life into the series. Once a franchise about car racing, ""Fast Five"" took an unexpected turn as a bank heist thriller in the vein of Steven Soderbergh's ""Ocean's 11,"" a welcomed change as seen by its huge box office earnings and critical success. Now, ""Furious 6"" is neither about car racing nor bank heists, but rather a terrorist threat with obvious inspirations from ""The Dark Knight."" Like ""Fast Five,"" the results are immensely satisfying and undeniably entertaining.The key to the franchise's upward turn in quality is due to director Justin Lin. He is a skilled action director, and many filmmakers can learn a few things or two from him: The action sequences are impressive, engaging, comprehensible, and well-shot, with practical effects to boot. There is a sense of danger, verve, and life in these scenes rarely found in other films, despite how over-the-top and ridiculous they may be; and yes, they often drift into gratify-defying territory. While I usually don't react out loudly when watching a film, this film had me gasping, jaw dropping, laughing, and applauding, sometimes all at once!Another ingredient to the film's success is the chemistry between the cast members. We have grown to love these characters over the course of the series that one cannot help but cheer on for them. In particular, Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous have such a terrific rapport with each other that they provide some of the film's biggest laughs and memorable one-liners. Additionally, Luke Evans is definitely a step up above the previous film's antagonist, and Gina Carano provides some great ass-kicking moments, although not much performance-wise. On another note, I want to mention how refreshing it is to see minority actors fill these roles. Certainly, the film's use of a diverse ensemble cast should be commended. As for the story, it's nothing special, but I dare you not to act surprised when several plot twists are revealed; I did so more than I would like to admit.If there's one thing to learn about this franchise, it's that some change can be a good thing. While the later sequels do focus away from the car racing, they still featured cars, which helped retain old fans while bringing in new ones. ""Furious 6"" is terrific entertainment, and judging by yet another dazzling cliffhanger and the audience's reaction, ""Fast & Furious 7"" will be an amazing finale for the series. Unfortunately, Justin Lin won't be back around for the last installment, but someone please get this man to direct every and all upcoming action flicks.",moviewizguy,5/16/13,2013
6,7,"As if a Tank wasn't enough, they got a Plane too","Fast & Furious over the last few installments has become all about action. And the latest outing takes it a step further. Almost 20% of the movie is comprised of action sequences. And at the expense of action, plot, writing, characters all take a backseat. But no one's complaining. Why ? Because the action makes up for all of it.Do the above statements sound cliché ??? The movie's plot is full of such silly dialogs so its best ignored in the current context. What works is the action - Lin and his crew bring us some of the most ridiculously outrageous and boldly conceived action sequences. There's an intense chase through London in the initial reels and also a race later on. There's a whole plane take-off-crash sequence towards the end that you've probably got a glimpse of in the trailers. The girls are no slouches either and we see an intense hand-to-hand fight of sorts between Michelle Rodriguez's Letty and Gina Carano's Riley.But the movie's best sequence is undoubtedly the 10 minute Tank chase across the freeway that involves most of the cast and culminates in a breathtaking ""catch"" (about which I'd not say any further). The camera cuts like crazy, music is pulsating and that single sequence is probably worth the price of the movie ticket.Apart from action, Furious 6 doesn't have much going for it. Dialog is standard, at times even silly and predictable, characters are flat, performances are decent. The car chases and night scenes got me so involved, I actually felt a bit strange leaving the theater and coming out into the real world's broad daylight. And the post-credits scene is simply, a treat which makes the next installment in the series worth looking forward to. Suffice it to say that in the end, the movie drifts full circle.Watch it for the action, and for the action alone. If you expect any sort of character development or family issues like the first installment had, you'll be disappointed. Else, you're in for one hell of a ride.Score: 7 / 10",KrazzyDJ,5/26/13,2013
8,6,Indeed a guy's movie...,"The faster the cars in this franchise seem to go, the more realism seems to go away with it. Sure, the action and car chases in ""Fast & Furious 6"" is breathtaking and spectacular, but the movie was just a tad over the top.I sat down to watch ""Fast & Furious 6"" simply because I had the opportunity, and because I wanted to watch it because of Michelle Rodriguez. I can't say that I had any particular hopes or expectations to this movie, nor can I claim that it was a movie release that I was in any way looking forward to.If you have seen any of the previous five movies then you know exactly what you will get here. There is nothing much new to be had here, it is essentially the same. However, that being said, then the movie is enjoyable, entertaining and fast-paced.This sixth installment to the franchise brings the return of an assumed dead member of the Toretto 'family' and it also brings the departure of one. The returning member is, of course, Letty. I am not going to reveal who will be departing - you'll just have to watch the movie for yourself and find out.As entertaining as the action was in the movie, then the last whole segment was a bit too much. I mean, a car bring down a massive Russian cargo airplane? That was just too much. And how long does it take for a plane of that size to get enough speed to become airborne? It just took forever. And speaking of forever, then that tarmac runway had to be the longest in the world - it just went on and on.As with the previous movies, then it is a great ensemble of actors and actresses, and it is as always a joy to have them returning to their parts, and there is a great chemistry between the various characters. I was especially thrilled to see Joe Taslim (playing Jah) in the movie; he did a great job in ""The Raid: Redemption"" and its great to see him make it into American cinema as well. He is definitely a guy to keep an eye on in the future.""Fast & Furious 6"" is, as the previous five movies, a guy's movie - full of adrenaline, muscle cars, car chases, macho guys and testosterone dripping off everywhere. The story was enjoyable, even with the part that went off the scale. And if you enjoyed any of the previous movies, then you definitely want to watch ""Fast & Furious 6"" as well.",paul_haakonsen,9/1/13,2013
9,9,"Hail, hail the gang's all here - but now minus one","Mixed emotions his the viewer seeing FAST AND FURIOUS 6 for the first time knowing that Paul Walker is gone and wondering what will happen with the in process Fast and Furious 7. But in ways that fact makes this movie more treasured. It is a whoop-'em up fast action packed film that takes your breath away with the wild car chases and one the ground derring- do. Writer Chris Morgan and director Justin Lin have this medium down to a predictable but fine science.The plot is fairly simple (as usual) allowing the telling of the story to be more important than any big philosophical notions. Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson, with even larger biceps varices!) has Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) reassemble their crew (Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Sung Kang) in order to take down mastermind Shaw (Luke Evans) who commands an organization of mercenary drivers across 12 countries. Payment? Full pardons for them all. The big driver is to 'rescue' Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who seems to be with Shaw's group after suffering amnesia, back into their fold. Wild situations abound and they are as exciting as ever – if not more so!Definitely worth watching even for those who are not long term F & F fans. It is a terrific action film with sparkling actors having a great time. Grady Harp December 13",gradyharp,12/12/13,2013
10,7,12 years after the first outing and the franchise is unrecognisable - which is a good thing,"The Fast and Furious franchise has undergone a radical transformation since launching 12 years ago, with the changes following Justin Lin taking hold of directorial duties from Tokyo Drift (film three) onwards.The series has made the transition from street races to include drugs, heists, and now terrorism, while lead characters Dom Toretto (Diesel) and Brian O'Conner (Walker) have gone from petty thug and law enforcer to wanted fugitives.With an opening sequence reminiscent of Quantum of Solace, Toretto and Brian screech around mountaintops as the latter readies himself to become a father, demonstrating how adult and family-minded they've become. Meanwhile, what follows is a nice refresher for those acquainted with the series and for newcomers alike, acting as a highlights reel to bring everyone up to speed of the events experienced in the previous five films.The antagonist for Fast 6 is Mr Owen Shaw (Evans), a former special ops military man that uses his knowledge, contacts and fast cars to make robberies for the highest bidder. In this instance, it just so happens he has his eyes on a chip that would incite terrorism in the wrong hands, which prompts baby oil-loving federal agent Hobbs (Johnson) to round up Toretto and his crew for back-up, offering them full pardons in exchange for their services.London is the main backdrop for the film, which, naturally, features a very corny cameo, though the the bright lights, black taxis and double-decker buses dotted around the city are infinitely more welcome.For me, five was the best of all of the films, but six gives it a run for its money, taking the stunts to ridiculous new heights (literally). You could, of course, reprimand the film for its use of impossible feats, but that's the whole point of these films, right? To get bigger and more extreme, as demonstrated with the big and extreme – and always affable – introduction of Johnson in Fast Five.For me, Johnson changed the game and breathed new life into a franchise that was beginning to get stale, and seeing Hobbs join forces with Toretto and co makes for brilliant viewing. The action is insane and the banter is electric, with the camaraderie between the cast obvious.The only criticism of the film is its length. There was a particular moment that seemed as though the film had wrapped, though it continued for another half hour, and while what followed was laced with adrenaline and big bangs, the film could have done with a 20 minute tightening.Shaw isn't an intimidating or imposing character, particularly when facing off against Hobbs and Toretto, but he is devious, ruthless and sharp, presenting an entirely new threat to the series.Those in the know will be aware Tokyo Drift threw the timeline entirely out of sequence, but the game comes full circle at the end of the film, and you won't want to miss the credits sequence that follows Originally posted at www.zentertainmentweekly.com7/10",zentertainmentweeklydotcom,5/21/13,2013
11,9,Incredible! Thoroughly enjoyable!,"I still can't believe I am giving a 9.0 to a film that is #6 in a brainless action franchise!I am not aware of any other franchise (except maybe, strangely enough, f13) where #6 is the best of the series. Normally the energy, creativity are gone by then.Not this time.I simply cannot believe how much I enjoyed every single minute of this film!There was even a decent plot!! (hey, for a film that is basically made up of fast cars, explosions and fight scenes, that says a lot!)However, I won't go into the plot - because there are some REAL twists in it, and it is better to go in with a fresh mind.It does help if you have seen the prior 5, but no sweat if you haven't. What really pleasantly surprised me was how funny this film was!! I would say about 1/2 the film was gut splitting comedy. It is rare that most jokes work in a film. Usually some fall flat. Not in this one! every single joke worked. I laughed so hard that I know I missed some!This is really meant to be seen on the big screen with a large crowd. I can't remember the last time so many people laughed, went 'WHOA!"" and ""yeah"" even clapping during a film!The film starts off with a bang and ends with a post-ending that will make you grin from ear to ear.The film deals with criminals who are obsessed with fast cars and like to create mayhem with their cars.Wall to wall action, comedy with just the right amount of drama and love interest.This could be ""the"" measurement for the brainless-feel-good-summer- action film.The only reason I am not giving this a 10.0 is because 1) it was a little long.. the final scene was almost a movie in itself (but it was a hoot!), and 2) in general I don't think any film is perfect. In some scenes (thankfully only a few) there were too many close ups that made it a little hard to follow the action. But I am really nitpicking here, folks.If you like action, fast cars, explosions, comedy....run, don't walk to see F&F 6.(and this from a guy who has the Seventh Seal and Alexander Nevsky in his DVD collection)",fritzlang,5/21/13,2013
13,5,Did the director go on holiday for the last third of the film and hand his directing duties to a 12 year old kid?,"This will contain MAJOR spoilers, so readers beware. Fast and Furious 6 just went off its rails, scrap that - it completely flew off its rails. This film turned utterly ridiculous to the point where I am left thinking ""why?"" There was no need for the film to pan out how it did. The first part (and I should point out) main bulk of the film was enjoyable, trying to track down Letty whilst working alongside the very man trying to stop them previously (Hobbs) offered something new and interesting and it made for some interesting moments. This part of the film I felt was good, even if they did practically ignore the car side of things. It's like they tried to force some stuff in there about the cars but then they never even showed what the cars actually where, or anything about the flipper car which was actually quite interesting. The first car sequence in the film they all used BMW 5 series? (This is major spoilers from now on) Why, if Riley is Shaw's girlfriend would she be ordered practically to her death throughout the whole film? There was a whole massive fight scene with Letty and herself, surely if they was working together that fight just didn't need to happen since no one was even there but those two see it. So they just had a fight for no reason. Why would Riley chase Letty so vigilantly? She could have let her get away without getting herself thrown down some concrete stairs. They forced this twist in the film for some reason. Then for the main car chase in the film / action sequence, Shaw's team capture a ""convoy"" which is just a truck and two jeeps. I can't fathom how stupid this actually is because not only does this tiny convoy have a hugely powered tank inside, it also has the chip worth ""billions"" and is a danger to everyone etc. Yet this convoy, of MILITARY personnel is incapable of protecting this vital piece of equipment. Men trained in warfare are treated like pawns which the criminals just shrug off with ease. Did I mention the military was aware Shaw's team was there, Shaw's team notorious for their driving ability and capture of convoys and yet this tank and lorry are just casually driving along with what may as well be no protection at all? Why? Why didn't they make the convoy seem stronger and actually include some intelligent action here for the capture of the tank? Then they actually capture this tank and Shaw's team are now military experts who know exactly how to control this tank. They needlessly kill dozens of innocent people by crushing them to death and no one even seems fazed by it. Now if a tank was captured in this way, who would come in to stop it? Not Dom and Brian. The rest of military would. Utterly ridiculous but I accept that is how the film works so I don't hold that against the film too much - that is just your typical mindless action movie stuff. It would have been much more interesting if the military got involved alongside the team though. Then it happens. The corniest moment I have ever seen in any film ever. Letty is catapulted over the edge of a huge bridge; she is flying through the air to her certain death. But wait! Dom then catapults himself from the other side of the bridge (there is a gap in the middle) catches her in mid air and lands perfectly onto a car to break their fall. Why does this scene have to exist? It's awful, from this moment on the film goes rubbish. This moment, is where I think the director/producer/writer went on holiday and no longer cared.

They capture Shaw at this point and he then reveals his team have taken Mia hostage. Fair enough, that's a decent ending and seems like it has set up for the next film perfectly. But no, Hobbs pulls a gun out and tells everyone how they are going to put loads of other lives at risk to save one person (Mia) by giving Shaw his chip and letting him go. The film then moves onto what is quite possibly the most unrealistic action scene ever recorded in Hollywood. Shaw has casually organised a cargo plane to pick them up from this military base. Where the hell did this cargo plane come from, an unauthorised huge military cargo plane Shaw just happens to have ready, and also access to a military base runway. This scene is meant to be about Shaw getting away. I'm not too sure on the science here but, if I am driving at 150mph onto a plane moving at 140mph will my car nice and gently stop when I get on the planes ramp? Or will my car suddenly shoot forwards from momentum and smash into the insides of plane. Honestly I'm not too sure but anyway... They kill Gisele for seemingly no reason and no one even cares. They don't even rush back to find her, they just accept she is dead. Likely she is but if you are Han in this situation do you stand there and accept it? Shouldn't he be getting in a car and rushing to where she fell to find her... Not to mention this huge plane exploded right next to everyone and no one was even that bothered by it. Just everything about this last scene I disliked, probably because it was just so unnecessary to begin with. They should have just ended the film with Owen Shaw being captured, then have Ian Shaw (Statham) break him free at the start of the next film. Instead they plonked this last ridiculous action scene in there just because the producers felt like it needed it. It really didn't. Film started off good then just went off the rails. 5/10.",carl-walster,5/20/13,2013
14,6,A fun addition to the franchise,"As the Fast & Furious franchise continues with it's simple enjoyments of fast cars, well oiled muscles and sexy ladies. This film does meet expectations, and is your typical faster and bigger sequel. This time the story follows Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and the gang. Who are this time not being chased but being recruited by Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson). To bring down international criminal Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) who is aided by once thought of dead Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez).What is good about the film is Director's, Justin Lin's decision to keep the film in a action-oriented direction. With a slight nods to it's street racing past. But focusing on 80's big muscle, big explosions nostalgia. Also the continuing use of practical effects over CGI backgrounds and locations. Make the film look all the more impressive. The action is over the top and a little silly but i did very much enjoy it. The only poor bit being a moment where Vin Diesel's character saves someone life taking the ridiculousness a bit to far. With the ever expanding cast the writers i imagine do have their work cut out for them. But everyone in the film except Jordana Brewster who again is given the short shrift do get their moments. But some of the comedy does miss it's mark, and the return of Letty is given the thinnest and quite unoriginal of explanations for her return. Also because of the huge cast of good guys, there is a lack of development for the villains. Making it difficult for Luke Evans who is actually very good in his role, to make a strong impression and did not become the threat to the team as much as he should of. This is a fun film, so just turn off your brain and enjoy the ride and be prepared for a very decent post credit sequence hopefully setting up a possibly very exciting Fast 7.",paulsrobinson,5/19/13,2013
15,7,Fast and Furious 6 review,"The previous installments of this franchise (specifically 1,2, Tokyo Drift and 4) was all about racing, sure there's a plot but it wasn't really shown well, then part 5 happened and the franchise took a different turn, it now became a heist film instead of the usual racing. I hated and I loved this turn of the franchise, I hated it because in part 5, the racing competition aspect of the film is gone, it became chases but I also loved this turn because it made the franchise take a different approach. My question is, will this formula still work with part 6? Find out below.Story: The story in this movie picks up after the previous one where it was known that 'Letty' (Michelle Rodriguez) was still alive and I admit that they handled her ""resurrection"" quite well but that is only the sub-plot of this movie. The main plot is Hobbs (The Rock) is chasing after Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). He then gets the help of Toretto and Brian's crew by using Letty as bait (or that's how I see it). The story is pretty simple and they told it without adding anymore sub plot but some of the sub plots that were made felt very crowded to the story even though it was solved. It just felt a little heavy and a bit too much for the movie.Acting: If you saw the previous installments from this franchise well then you ain't missing anything from their performance, it's pretty much the same but I have to say this though, Vin Diesel and The Rock displays pure bad-assery in this movie. That being said, I will give my two cents on the two characters from this movie which are Gina Carano who played Riley and Luke Evans who is Owen Shaw. Carano was able to hold her own despite having little dialogue and what makes her character seems badass is because of her action scene, this is actually one of the things I'm looking forward to upon seeing this movie because I loved her in 'Haywire' (awesome film, check it out) and I;m confident to say that I am not disappointed with her on this one. Next is Luke Evans, he IMO is one the versatile actors in the industry today, you can cast him in almost any role and he displays a good performance. In here is the main villain although he gave a good performance in this role I find it hard to find him as an effective villain, there is something missing with his performance here I'm just not sure what it is.Action: The Fast franchise is definitely known for having one of the best car chases ever and this one doesn't disappoint and it does not only have car chases but also fist fights, head bangin' and other sh*t. Even though some of the action scene were very over the top it was still entertaining and was handled pretty well. The action was not violent or brutal as it showed little to no blood and being a fan of R-13 I can say that this rating does not fit well to the style of FF and I'm happy and contented with it's PG-13 rating. IMO this is the most action-packed FF film so far.Cinematography: The cinematographer did a wonderful job here, the shots were just amazing and adds depth to the mood that is set within each scene. The shots were able to show scenery that really captures the beauty of the set and like I said the mood of the scene.Direction: I wasn't much of a fan of Lin's direction here, it was pretty slow which made the film a little boring for me despite having heavy action. Even though the movie is a little slow paced, Lin was able to tell the story with it's whole heart. I liked how he did the pacing in FF 5 though.Overall: 'Fast and Furious 6' was high-octane action movie injected with some humor. Using the same formula as the previous one made this film good and also bringing back the racing aspect of the original FF films. While I consider the FF 5 is still the best one in the franchise, I can still say that this is one solid addition to it. I give this movie a 3.5/5P.S. Watch the post-credit scene, it made me get hyped for Fast and Furious 7.",whoa17,5/24/13,2013
18,7,Fuious 6,"I'm going to keep this short, simple and sweet because that is exactly what this film is. It's great summer fun for all ages that manages to succeed on the one thing I hate in horror movies; make an idiot of itself. It is where this stupidity in plot events comes from that gives the film its fuel to do nothing but provide brainless over-the-top popcorn fun. It is done so by having some of the best sound editing I have heard in a while with brilliantly paced action sequences, with one fight scene in particular that will surly be the best action scene of the year. I recommend Furious 6 if you're looking to have some fun, but whatever you do, do not walk in there expecting The King's Speech, because it is not what this movie is trying to be- which makes this film so admirable.Grade: B+",edwardscissorhands123,6/4/13,2013
19,10,Film of the year,"I went to the cinema with quite low expectations due to the trailer. However after watching this film i was amazed by the outcome. There was so much thrilling tense action, at one point i was on the edge of my seat. The fights and the car chases were magnificent. The series seems to be getting better and better. Fast and furious 6 is by far the best one, and i can't wait for number 7. There was so much going on and the ending was awesome. I will definitely buy this on DVD when it comes out. Great acting from the casts. This is the most entertaining film of 2013 so far. There was epic cars, sexy girls and brilliant locations.10/10",losangcodbazzinga,5/22/13,2013
21,7,"An Adrenaline-Fueled Action Ride, and a Good One at that.","The Fast and the Furious franchise has never been known for an engrossing story. No one goes to the movies to see character development and a complicated storyline. They go for the cars, the girls, and the explosions, and this installment has all of the above, including a fair story.A ghost from Dom's past, Letty, has come back from the dead, and Dom reunites the team from Fast Five (a team that works on all levels) in order to get her back. Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson provide some of the humor of the film, with their bantering back and forth throughout, but I found that the theater I was in laughed and cheered throughout the course of the movie. The action is good, and never lets up. For a film that is over two hours, I found myself only checking the time when I thought the finale was happening (to see how long it would be).What you want in this film is something as good as Fast Five. Something original and fresh. What you get is something that improves on Fast Five (and the rest of the series) on all levels. This is by far the best Fast and Furious movie ever, and it really shows how a series like this can turn around from something as bad as Tokyo Drift.And it has a nice set up for Fast & Furious 7 during the credits, where we get a little surprise for the villain of the next film.Bravo, this film is awesome, and should be viewed by fans of both the series and of action movies in general.8/10",Papatheodorou,7/6/13,2013
22,8,Bold imagination and beautiful execution of some of the most exhilarating car chases ever done on film make this the unequivocal franchise best thus far,"Really, how many franchises can claim to be at their best the sixth time round? But that is exactly where the 'Fast and Furious' team are at with this exercise in pure exhilaration. Just when we feared that it might be difficult to top the jaw-dropping finale in 'Fast Five', director Justin Lin proves that he has reserved his best one yet for what has been announced as his final outing at the helm after four consecutive runs.Continuing what began as an invigorating transition from streetcar racing to heist film the last time round, resident scribe Chris Morgan ups the stakes by pitting our favourite anti-heroes against their most dangerous opponent yet. That man is Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), an ex-SAS officer turned mercenary who leads a nefarious gang of criminals bent on stealing the components capable of assembling a lethal weapon to be used by terrorists. As Tyrese Gibson's designated comic relief character Roman describes, Shaw's guys are pretty much the evil twins of Toretto's team, hence the return of other familiar supporting characters like Han (Sung Kang), Tej (Chris ""Ludicrous"" Bridges) and Gisele (Gal Gadot).Even as Morgan evolves the franchise, he understands that the character dynamics have been one of the highlights of each film, and this sequel to 'Fast Five' preserves and builds on the relationships that its predecessor established. Besides the budding romance between Han and Gisele (in our opinion, exotic and very nicely played) and the deepening of familial ties between O'Conner and Toretto's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) with the birth of their child, there is sensibly the return of Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), which through the last film, transformed from dogged adversary to unlikely ally.It is Hobbs who reunites Toretto's team together to pursue Shaw - the strategic equivalent of ""fighting fire with fire"" - with no less than the promise of full pardon if they succeed. Amidst the crowded ensemble, Morgan picks up on a new angle set in motion from the concluding events of the last film. Once presumed dead, Toretto's former squeeze Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) has turned up as one of Shaw's known associates, a good part of the quieter moments of the film spent rekindling the romance between the ex-lovers.Of course, this isn't a movie with many such moments - except for the occasional expositions about family - so you can forgive the lack of character development for new supporting additions Riley (MMA fighter and 'Haywire' star Gina Carano) and Jah ('The Raid's' Joe Taslim); the former Hobbs' new partner and the latter Shaw's kungfu-kicking henchman. Instead, both Carano and Taslim are there to add a different flavour of adrenaline in the form of close-combat fight scenes, and let's just say that they each get their own sequence to show off their respective moves.But aside from an impressive bit of tag-team ass-kicking from Toretto and Hobbs against one of Shaw's equally hulk-sized crew (Kim Kold), the bulk of the action is meant to unfold against broad open canvases, as opposed to close quarters. Lin neatly - and we might add, beautifully - choreographs three elaborate chase sequences with loads of automobile destruction that the franchise has been known for, even more extraordinary for how he manages to top one after the next.In chronological order, Lin begins with a grand introduction to Shaw and his gang with an intricately staged chase down the streets of London - although the fact that Shaw's military-styled vehicle looks like the Batmobile from Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight' trilogy might provide a hint where Lin could have gotten his inspiration. Yet any doubts about Lin's originality are quickly dispelled once we get to the second setpiece, a boldly imagined art of mass destruction matched equally in its stunning execution. As the trailer has amply teased, this one has Toretto and his crew behind the wheel in pursuit of Shaw and his men inside a tank on a Canaries highway.The most breathtaking of all he leaves for last, which though utterly ludicrous, represents probably one of the most awesome stunt pieces you will see this year. Since no other film has dared to use cars to take down a Russian cargo plane about to take off, Lin does just that. Not only do Toretto's team face off with Shaw's mob in cars racing at near impossible speeds, they attach their vehicles to the wings of the plane with gleeful abandon to any thought of their own lives - though as a warning, not all will make it through to the already announced sequel next summer. If Lin intends to go out with a 'bang', let's just say he accomplishes it many times over.The exquisitely staged vehicular mayhem is complemented by a firm sense of camaraderie amongst Toretto's group. Gibson's one-liners are snappy and more amusing than they were in 'Fast Five', and his banter with Kang and Ludicrous not only keep the film's momentum going while the plot pieces are put in place but also establish the kind of teamwork necessary for the subsequent action scenes. And not forgetting the brawny charisma of Diesel and Johnson, which enliven the film as much as they did in the last one.If you ask us to judge this against then-franchise best 'Fast Five', we'd say that this more than tops the fun and excitement that it offered. There are two qualities which make or break a 'Fast and Furious' film - how enjoyable is it to hang out with Toretto and his crew and how thrilling are the car chases. On both counts, this sixth entry surpasses the heights established by its predecessor, setting an even higher bar for its successor. But if the coda before the end credits is anything to go by, there's plenty of reason to get excited for next summer's follow-up.",moviexclusive,5/21/13,2013
23,7,"Fast 6, Fast but not quite as Furious as the previous outing","The Fast and Furious franchise is one of the more strange ones – it improved the older it became. Coinciding with the 10 year anniversary of the The Fast and the Furious, Fast 5 marked the highpoint in the hugely popular series. Street racing culture was ditched in favor of a heist plot in Rio de Janeiro. To say it worked would be a massive understatement. Fast 6 is continuing where its predecessor left off, although with a little twist. As it has already been explained in the trailers, the team surrounding Vin Diesel's Torreto character is asked to help Luke Hobbs (played by the ever charismatic Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) capturing criminal mastermind Owen Shaw (portrayed by Luke Evans), this time around in London. The Good Working in its favor is the wonderful backdrop provided by the London metropolitan area. It offers a lot of variety and distinguishes Fast 6 from the previous entry. The chemistry between Torreto's crew is as good as it has ever been. Furthermore, The Rock really meshes well with any of the gang.Tyrese, without going into detail the banter he shares with Ludicrous or the aforementioned Dwayne Johnson is worth the ticket admission alone. It's obvious that his character serves as comedic relief, as has been the case in Fast 5, but he has to have the funniest scenes in any of the major (non-comedy) blockbusters this year. The action in the FF series was never realistic to begin with, so no surprises here. Still, it shouldn't take away from some impressive set- pieces. Justin Lin knows what he's doing. The Bad Fast 6 is too crowded; there are too many characters in the movie. Even the main villain, Owen Shaw, is underdeveloped, as is the Letty sub- plot. It just feels like the producers were gung-ho about reuniting the principle actors from the very first FF movie, at any cost. Gina Carano, though she can definitely hold her own in the action scenes her acting is wooden at best. If pressed for a comparison – she'd be a bad female imitation of notorious stoneface Keanu Reeves. There's little to no facial expression. Frankly, her character is redundant. She may have pulled a half-decent performance in Haywire, but given the nature of her character (a stoic, hardened, operative) it played right to her strengths (or lack thereof?). At this rate it's hard to see her carrying a movie anytime soon. Conclusion Fast 6 is one of the better flicks in the franchise, perhaps the second best, but some way off Fast 5. One can't help but feel that the finished product has been rushed into production. A little fine-tuning (no pun intended) here and there would've served the movie better. The ending in particular is a little underwritten; it's not as glorious or as satisfying as Fast 5.",j-pryde,5/19/13,2013
24,2,You shouldn't watch this movie if:,"1) You care about the laws of physics 2) You actually want to see illegal street races 3) You are over 12 4) You know something about cars (and planes... and tanks) 5) You expect movies to have a script 6) You think the memory loss Tom & Jerry plot is too old 7) You want jokes to be funny 8) You want to see good acting 9) You want to see Jason Statham

I usually enjoy mindless action movies, like Transformers or The Expendables. But this one is just horrible. People in the cinema were laughing because the action just wouldn't stop. It was just ridiculous. After the movie, we were saying that our IQ level just dropped.

However, if you are under 12 and you think The Rock rocks, you should definitely watch this.",jedimaster_yoda,6/10/13,2013
25,7,Level of Absurdity,"2011's Fast Five was the franchise's glory for abandoning the sins that slows down their movies and excel to something crazier and suitable to what it is called. Fast & Furious 6 grows the scale with even more ridiculous car racing and stunts. Now it involves a fight between military and terrorism while it has a serious sentiment about family. Things can get way out of hand, but the film is so fun, it's hard complain about how stupid it is. It's not a classic, but the stuff that are supposedly awkward actually made the film a fantastically exhilarating ride.Before, there were just street racing and cartels. The last one is about an extreme heist. Now they are chasing down super terrorists, running away from tanks, and a character who faked her death. The more stories they tell, the sillier it becomes, but no matter how absurd these are, they are still a pleasure to watch. They are really forgetting the mistakes of the past(first four) films and think more creative ways to excite the viewers. The series also finally has a highlighting villain. A campy one as well that could fit in a superhero movie. The weakest parts of the story are the twists that are much inane than the craziness it was displayed. The sideline of the plot is about family. It contrasts between Dom's team who are loyal, and Owen's team who are careless. It's a fine speculation but nobody would care about it.We are here for the racing, cars crashing, and some fistfights. The last film had cars that can pull off a vault, now we see a bunch of cars pulling down a cargoplane. It shows how it insanely ignores the laws of physics. It's exasperating if you take it too seriously, but I don't think anyone would ever take a blockbuster like this too seriously. However, they are amazingly directed. The tank scene, which was already beyond ridiculous, was kind of inspired. And the early London chase was an energetic sequence. The performances are the same before. What's new about Vin Diesel is the swagger he makes in the end. Dwayne Johnson is always entertaining, but he is much entertaining when he was beating a guy around an interrogation room. Newcomer Luke Evans really makes a worth rooting villain. His character is not as well developed as any villains from big blockbusters, but he manages to make this one slickly fun.Fast & Furious 6 reaches the scale of blockbusters that have superheroes, super spies, aliens, or whatever. Except the cars are the ones that have superpowers here. These set of magnificently dumb action sequences reminiscence your standard blockbuster when this film is suppose to be smaller than those kinds of films. It's strangely grander and louder, but of course, it's also as fast as the title suggests. Verdict would still call Fast Five the best of the series, but honestly they are both equally good. This one just takes a new level of absurdity even though the characters are trying to be down to earth. Fast & Furious 6 is far from perfect but as a modern blockbuster it's an extremely entertaining film.",billygoat1071,5/25/13,2013
27,6,Quirky humor and insane set pieces overcome its shoddy plot,"While it doesn't reach the same height as Fast Five, the newest and most ludicrous installment of the franchise thus far still packs a lot of noisy high octane entertainment in its engine. With increasingly expanding star-studded cast, Fast & Furious 6 exhibits a lot of value by just pinning these familiar names together in scenes, despite some of the script they use doesn't really work. It has good amount of humor, and also highly dubious amnesia plot. Quite frankly, it does its best when it doesn't try to be serious.Starring buff gents and ladies, almost everyone on-screen has weighty name, although they are heavily leaning towards action oriented rather than acting, which might've been the direction from the start. Plot revolves around Vin Diesel trying to woe the amnesic Michelle Rodriguez, thus involving the crew into a shady military operation in the process. It gives what people want in spade, the bridging between set pieces is fairly clumsy, but it does pay off with ridiculous amount of flying cars and bodies.Surprisingly enough, there are plenty of melee brawl across the movie. The addition of Gina Carano, the MMA star, is a good choice, she brings the rawness in these scenes. Several others will join the fray in close combat, obvious if they have The Rock and Vin Diesel it'd be a waste not to. However, there are some stunts that borderline corny and unrealistic, even by Fast and Furious standard, many wiring might look awkward as well. It's not a major concern, but I prefer the more structured natural stunts rather the high flying ones.Chasing scenes have been up-scaled, bringing ramp cars, tank and whatnot into the mix. Apparently, there's demand for even more over-the-top driving scenes to fulfill. This is where it truly shines, fast motion, carnage all around and seemingly impossible traits. The building up and finish are somewhat imbalance, sometimes resorting to incredibly odd coincidences. Script works adequately, some of its jokes are better than others, and definitely league ahead compare to the supposedly more dramatic scenes.Fast & Furious goes extra miles for crowd enjoyment. Action junkies or car enthusiast will be pleased, however the result is less organized pace. The movie is a blast, even if there are shortcomings, catering directly to the core audience.Rate 6.5",quincytheodore,5/23/13,2013
28,6,Loads of Action!,"Review: I quite enjoyed this action packed movie, which had a decent storyline and loads of car chases and explosions. It's basically want you expect from a movie in this franchise, which was what I found a bit disappointing because there wasn't much fresh ideas. The tank and the plane was a bit different but that was about it. What made me laugh was the length of the runway for the plane scene and it was amazing how they made England look so glossy. Anyway, if you look at the money that the movie made, expect many sequels and with the introduction of the Rock in the last movie, he has obviously made a massive difference to the franchise. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Everyone in this movie has been in the gym before there scenes because it sacked full of muscles. Even the ladies show that they can hold there own against the men. The Rock is over pumped and in every scene he looks like he's sweating because he has just put the weights down. Anyway, the director done a good job with putting this movie together, especially as it was set in England. Some of the stunts were a bit over the top, but that's what you expect from a Fast & Furious movie. All the way through the film, Vin Diesel is sizing himself up next to the Rock, but I liked the chemistry between them. In all, there wasn't anything that really stood out about the film, but it does keep you on the edge of your seat and you just don't know what there going to come up with next. Maybe boats or horses, lol.Budget: $160million Worldwide Gross: $789millionI recommend this movie to people who are into the Fast & Furious franchise, which always brings loads of action and, of course, cars. 6/10",leonblackwood,9/22/13,2013
29,8,In life Speed and Family are the two best things,"From the first frame of Fast and Furious 6 we realize that this is not really about a movie about heist and car chases (well okay it has this); no this is a movie about the depths you will go and the willingness to do whatever you can to protect family. Leaving off where Fast five left off, most of the characters are off on there, whether it be hanging in Tokyo, flying pretty ladies to manacu to making people feel low about there rough life to a new baby being born, the crew is in hiding and living the life abroad. It's at the point that the plot ramps up and we get a Dom Terretto going after a would be thief Owen Shaw ( a new type of villain) and trying to save the somehow resurrected Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) who has joined Shaw in his wanting to take over the world. Bring most people back from the Fast Five and you got yourself a movie. This movie isn't what I call the most coherent, it has issues and Owen Shaw's character is kind of one note, but this isn't the type of movie that you need to worry about great story. It's the type of movie that you go to watch and have fun , and watch the unbelievable happen. Everyone In this movie looks like there comfortable being there and seem to be having fun. It's what I would call an audience movie, the type of movie that feels In sync enough that everyone's on board There are plenty of laughs thanks to Tyrese and plenty of drama thanks to Toretto and Brian's relationship and history in the series. They pull together to do the subject justice. I don't want to spoil anything but this movie does lead up to a point that all the films finally have a connecting tissue and what you thought you knew with the bonus scene at the end will lead into an interesting 7th film. Lets just hope James Wan doesn't ruin the good will this series has gained.",buiredintime,5/14/13,2013
30,7,Fast & Furious hasn't ran out of gas yet. Seems like it is just getting started.,"Honestly, how many movies are they going to make out of these characters? I know, most of the actors can't find work outside from the popular Fast and Furious film series, but seriously, it's the 7th movie in film series. It's starting to look like all they got is this franchise. The actors are all becoming ""One trick Ponys"" in my opinion. In my opinion, this movie by director Justin Lin is probably the Fastest and the Furiousness yet. Still you got to watch the other movies to even get this far in. There is a lot of things you wouldn't get if you didn't watch the previous films. Fast & Furious 6 follows a professional criminal gang led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) who have retired following their successful heist in Fast Five (2011), but remain wanted fugitives. U.S. Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) offers to clear the group's criminal records and allow them to return home in exchange for helping him to take down a skilled mercenary organization led by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) and his second in command, Dominic's presumed-dead lover Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) who is after a secret military chip. There wasn't a lot of silly moments which Fast Five was full of, in my opinion in this movie; but the car coming out the nose of an airplane is bit outrageous dumb. Still, that had to be the longest airport runway in the history of the earth. The plane in the movie was in flight for 5min 33sec. Based on that the runway was at least 13.88 miles long, that doesn't even include the beginning of the take-off and the fact that where they stopped. It didn't seem to be anywhere near the end. Longest runway I know of is 18000 ft. Anyways the action was pretty intense, you might have not notice that. The tank battle was pretty good as well. I just didn't like the whole bringing in the speed racing theme into the middle of the movie. I know it's in the original Fast & Furious movie (2001), but it takes out the seriousness of this film. The plot get more and more out there. With each passing film you can see it becoming more and more far- fetched. Most of this movie plot come from Fast & Furious (2009) since it deals with Letty. In 5 films, not counting Tokyo Drift (2006), the story has evolved from fast cars, racing and hijacking tractor trailers to heist money from drug cartels to now fighting international terrorists. Then you got people turning evil to good, good to evil. I didn't know being an international terrorist can get parole from the same country, she was attacking. Watch the movie to get who I am talking about. I noticed Vin Diesel doesn't look very buff out like he used to be. Age is getting to him. Still, the Rock doesn't look normal. Are you sure this guy isn't taking Steroids? The acting is OK; everybody had their bit parts. Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous give the film its laughs and memorable one-liners. There wasn't anything new and sexy in this film unlike the others, but seeing Gal Galdot was pretty OK. Han (Sung Kang) is always an interesting character of mine. Also make sure you check out, Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) before watching what happen after the end credits. There also a special new actor joining the cast on the 8th movie. Overall: Sit back and enjoy the ride, let reality leave you for a couple hours.",ironhorse_iv,5/28/13,2013
31,8,Definitely Fast and Definitely Furious,"I'm not to fond a franchises that don't when it's time to hang it up and let it's running time leave a good memory in our brains but for some reason, the studios want to keep this franchise going but I must say I'm glad they haven't because Fast and Furious 5 was pretty dope and now I can say Fast and Furious 6 is just as equally amazing. I was actually excited to see this movie and believe me when I say, I wasn't disappointed in the least. I'm an action movie junkie, and this film had plenty of it. I've been enjoying the F&F transformation from being a movie about illegal street racing and stealing car parts, to heists, drug lords, undercover agents, the cartel and now, even terrorism. There was plenty of car chases, hand to hand combat, shoot outs and even a breathtaking ending scene hat involved an airport, a huge aircraft and a takeoff runway that was definitely awesome to watch. Doing six films would definitely bring the cast together, and you can see their chemistry on screen, especially between Tyrese, Ludicrous, the Asian dude and the south American beauty. There comedic banter was funny. I was pleasantly surprised with our antagonist, Luke Evans. I'm used to seeing him play the hero and aiding the good side, so seeing him as the bad guy was different but it worked. Not only is a beyond sexy with that shaved head but it totally worked. My favorite scene was with Riley (from Haywire) chasing Michelle Rodriguez through the subway and Tyrese and Asian dude's character chasing the other bad guy through the subway. My only pet peeve was the dialogue. You would think that after six movies, the writers could come up with more realistic things for the cast to say instead writing all these cheesy one liners that we've been hearing in 90% of all action movies for the past twenty years. Some of the lines really made me cringe and I had to whisper to myself ""really Justin Lin?! That's the best you got?!"" But the cheesy one liners were overlooked by a few unpredictable plot twists that helped the story move along.But overall I give this movie an 8 because it gives you everything an action movies is supposed to offer. Believable bad ass heroes and villains, car chases, big guns, explosions, shoot outs, hand to hand combat, sexy ass kicking women, beautiful cars, sexy men, funny moments, an unforgettable ending action sequence, and of course a post credits scene that makes you anxious for the seventh film. I would definitely recommend this film.",champjohnson29,5/27/13,2013
34,6,The most ridiculous and over the top installment in this franchise,"This is probably the most ridiculous and over the top movie in this franchise so far. And the previous movies in this franchise gets pretty darn ridiculous and over the top. The thing is there is some cool action sequences but I just quickly became numb to it. Especially since there just wasn't much substance when it comes to the story. It's basically the good guys team led by Dominic Toretto against Owen Shaw's team which the bad guys team. This whole movie however goes in a extremely superficial and lame direction it gets slightly annoying. Especially how all the character constantly tries to prove how macho they are. Especially Letty Ortiz who make it back into this franchise somehow which isn't really surprising. She is basically ""The Grouchy Ladybug"" and is a laughable character. She even goes head to head with Gina Carano. Few of the humor works most don't but it's all corny as hell, like it's straight from some Michael Bay movie. Maybe even the action sequences as well. The thing is this movie seemed like the story revolved around the action sequences. Which means they probably planned all the action sequences then tried to figure out a way to connect the story to those action sequences. I heard the plane scene was suppose to be in ""Fast Five"" but they took it out of the storyboard because of lack of budget and since it seemed random. I did like how it sort of connects all the previous movies into this franchise into this one. Anyways if your in the mood for a action movie with tons of action but forgettable characters despite it being the 6th installment in this franchise and lame story. You might enjoy this, well I thought it was a watchable popcorn flick.

35,5,Disappointment even for the mildest F&F fan,"This movie started off really well, however, it was set off course after the action started. I have to warn those that watched the trailers on television, because they spoiled every exciting scene from the movie. I would not consider myself an avid fan, but I have followed the series ever since the first movie and I would be the first one to tell you that this movie is a major disappointment. After Tokyo drift, the director relied heavily on action and random fillers to please the audience while leaving the fans frustrated and confused. And since when did the acronym ""F&F"" turn from fast and furious to fast and fighting? This series has started it's roots from racing and formed into another predictable action movie.

Now, to the ridiculous part of the review. The last scene with the cargo jet is beyond unrealistic. This scene was around 15 minutes long and I would like to point out that the take-off speed of a vast jet like that is around 150-200 mph (not to mention they had to increase speed in order to take-off due to the added weight). The runway must been around 50 miles long because they were on there for literally 15 minutes traveling at an average speed of 150mph+. And don't even get me started with the whole Gisele dying scene. The director got rid of her faster than all those V-8 powered engines put together!

I pointed out a bit of information what the reviewer ""carl-walster"" missed. He did an amazing job to point out how really ridiculous the movie really was. I have a great imagination, but this movie was too difficult to comprehend. And how could some of these other reviewers say this was the best of fast and furious? That's blasphemous!",tony_pop_1,5/20/13,2013
36,6,Watch it with half the brain you used to watch Fast Five with,"Oh wow, this is what you call jumping the shark. It all started in 2001 with a low budget film about the street racing subculture. Now its become an action film franchise with over the top machismo. Each film progressively chipped away more logic and physics.Now I actually liked Fast Five because it actually had a believable premise given the context. Yes it was cheesy and over testosteroned but it actually had a well paced plot. However the cast has ballooned to a very large size, this film's become very unfocused. So much so that every character is now laughably one dimensional. There are numerous contrived plot points and no character ever questions anything. The Rock's character is after a bad guy but since the bad guy uses cars, oh, I need Vin Diesel AND HIS TEAM for this. And yeah, everyone is willing no question.I thought that Fast Five actually concluded the characters story arcs but they wanted to due a fan service by resurrecting Michelle Rodriguez. And it was done in the most contrived fashion as possible by giving her amnesia.The film did have some pretty good set pieces but sadly you saw all these action sequences in the trailer. And thats because the film slows down in the second act and it tries to liven up by even putting in a street race in the middle of a surprisingly empty London. And that's weird seeing how each film's plot revolves around how many car stunts they can put in.And the action scenes really make the vault drag in Fast Five physically plausible. There is so much flying around and defying gravity, I'll bet you'll see less in the upcoming Superman film. And the physics of this film is so inconsistent. In the tank scene we see the villain engage in casual murder by pancaking all the cars in a highway yet it seems to have trouble crushing Tyrese's car. Also the plane scene in the climax; that must be the longest runway in the world.I can see why Justin Lin took this franchise to that many films, because the initial ones weren't that profitable. However at over 2 hours long, you start wondering how you could take any of the cheesy dialogue that fills this film seriously.Oh well, its pure popcorn pleasure. It knows what it does, even though you'll be palming your forehead at many instances.",arnieiam,6/4/13,2013
39,8,Pure Entertainment,"Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker) are asked by Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) to stop Shaw (Luke Evans) the leader of a criminal crew of skilled mercenary drivers who are acquiring parts to build a powerful gun to be sold to terrorists. Shaw needs one last chip to complete the gun. If successful Dom's crew will get a full pardon from their illegal exploits during Fast and Furious 5. I was told that F&F 6 was the best one of all the sequels, And, after seeing this I believe they are correct. Of course it was all the vehicle chases that made it for me. What I saw was almost unbelievable. I don't know how much CGI was in evidence, but I do know that over 70 stunt men were used (I counted them in the credits) so I would venture to say these stunts with vehicles were fantastic.You will see some things that you will have you saying, ""that's impossible."" Maybe so, but this is excellent entertainment. Suspend logic and enjoy yourself. The photography and editing were incredible to say the least. As you watch you may have wished your couch came with seat belts. Kudos all around. You go to these kinds of movies to see the vehicle chases, not for the acting which was okay for this is type of movie. For the most part , there is not a lot of dialogue in here. Oh, and for your viewing pleasure the director saw fit to throw in an Army tank and a big cargo plane. Wait until you see how they are used. Wow! This just gets better and better. So if you like car chases with vehicles and people flying thru the air, and explosions this is for you. Hey, I was entertained. Yes, there is a story here too, but it plays second fiddle and there is a twist you may not see coming. Also, Dom finds out that his former love interest, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), is alive and working for Shaw (Say What???). How can this be? Dom needs to find out. Oh, when it's all over keep your seat belt on because after many of the credits run, you will see that F&F 7 is in the works and you won't believe who will be in it. Stay tuned. (8/10)Violence: Yes.

41,10,Thrill ride par excellence,"For motor-heads, the Fast and Furious franchise is pure sin, the sins getting bigger and badder with every sequel. But the franchise is more than just car flicks. They have established an instant connection with today's youth culture gorged in hip hop, street cred and video game violence, spanning continents. While many thought that the previous installment Fast Five was the very pinnacle the series could aim for, out comes Fast and Furious 6, breaking all previous boundaries, and shattering myths that a 6th installment cannot be creative, and is one too many. Before we talk of the movie though, let us take a moment to absorb the legend of the sullen hero- Vin Diesel.

""If you rearrange the letters in Vin Diesel it reveals his credo: ""I End Lives.""

""Vin Diesel invented black. In fact, he invented the entire spectrum of visible light. Except pink. Tom Cruise invented pink.""

""The eternal conundrum ""what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object"" was finally solved when Vin Diesel punched himself in the face.""

Part espionage thriller, and part testosterone fueled race track, the movie starts off in first gear though, with the gang dissipated across the world spending their 100 million heist that they had carried out in Fast Five in their own ways, though a mountain road race between Diesel and Walker portends of things to come. Things shift gears once federal agent Hobbs (The Rock) enlists the help of the Furious gang to bring down a terrorist (Luke Evans) who has skills to match the Furious. An old member of the gang previously presumed dead returns too. The motivations matter little, what matters is that they are loud, ooh-aha inducing and, with the addition of MMA fighter Gina Carano, extremely brutal. And if you thought that the highway mayhem with the tank that is featured in the trailer was the maximum director Justin Lin was attempting, you are so very wrong. He has in store a shattering climax which involves the Furious gang battling the villains in a cargo plane the size of an island, with a dozen supercharged sports cars with harpoons trying to stop it from taking off. What is customary though is the ball of fire in the end, and Diesel walking out of it, unscathed, smiling. Some more homage to the man, then-

""When Vin Diesel goes to donate blood, he declines the syringe, and instead requests a handgun and a bucket.""

""Vin Diesel played Russian Roulette with a fully loaded gun and won.""

""In an average living room there are 1,242 objects Vin Diesel could use to kill you, including the room itself.""

Director Justin Lin has conjured up a movie that makes you forget all other F and F ones. Never mind that there is a plot to boot, most of the films budget and time is aptly dedicated to high speed dueling, massive explosions, inspired stunt-work and creative property damage. The actors don't have too much to act about, but you would expect this to be a Diesel, Rock or a Paul Walker movie. But no, it is an out and out Romano (Tyrese Gibson) movie. Every Romano moment is a LOL moment, and he more than makes up for the forced seriousness of the other cast members. Luke Evans as the villain is a bad choice though- he has absolutely no personality in front of these towering hunks, but he does seem to have x-ray vision when he points at Diesel and says ""Look at his face. He is so angry""- meanwhile Diesel remains as impassive as ever. Can't have enough of him?

""The word ""lesbian"" derives from an old Latin phrase that roughly translates as ""She who has not yet been introduced to Vin Diesel.""

""There is no theory of evolution, just a list of creatures Vin Diesel allows to live.""

""Vin Diesel once ate the entire cake at a bachelor party before anyone could tell him there was a stripper in it.""

Love cars or hate cars, critics and reviews be damned, just go and watch Fast and Furious 6, popcorn in hand. This is a shamelessly entertaining, guffaw inducing, and awe-inspiring thrill ride. Wait till the end though, and we are introduced to what will come in part 7. Perhaps the only real competition in Hollywood to Diesel's racing skills. Any guesses? Or you would rather like to be transported somewhere�.10/10",achyutaghosh,5/23/13,2013
43,7,A surprisingly enjoyable film.,"Fast & Furious 6 is not the kind of film that I generally like. It's preposterous, absurd and completely in your face. But I enjoyed it! It's not really a good film, let alone a great one. However, that does not really matter. This is a film that does not take itself too seriously - and it's all the better for it. The director and the cast seem to know exactly what they're doing - and they deliver a film that won't live long in the memory but which nonetheless provides two hours or so of solid entertainment that allows the viewer to forget about the stresses and strains of modern life for a while. And, it does so very well indeed. Much of the film is set in London. The plot strains credulity and is full of holes. It took me a while to get used to some of the characters and what I assume were occasional references to their back stories (because I have not seen any of the 5 earlier films in this seemingly ever popular series). But, to be honest, the details of the plot are not really that important. Fast & Furious 6 is an almost wholly visual film about machismo, crazy driving sequences and adventure. Vin Diesel (that cannot be his real name, surely?) is very good in the lead role and he is ably supported by a cast that seems to have been plucked from the United Nations branch of central casting. I particularly liked Luke Evans (Owen Shaw), who plays the arch baddie.Fast & Furious 6 is the sort of film that defies rational criticism. It's a delightfully innocent, energetic and enjoyable romp. 7/10",roger-pettit1,5/20/13,2013
44,9,Pretty ace film!,"Having only seen Fast & Furious 4 & 5! This was pretty epic!

The story was pretty decent! Not amazing, but pretty good in it's own respect! Also how it took place in London was pretty ace! Liked the rapid shots of the chases that took place! The fighting scenes were epic! Especially the ones that took place in the London underground! Really got me on the edge of my seat! Lacked racing a bit, but wasn't too bad!

The ending was just epic! With the car chase in Spain with the army tank! Epic! Along with the epic finale ending with them taking down the giant air plane, along with fights taking place in the air plane!! Then the plane blowing up into flames! Just awesome!

Great film!

Overall a decent film! With great action sequences in it! 9/10.",vengeance20,5/21/13,2013
45,7,Just another evolution of the series not the revolution,"Like a well-oiled engine, the Fast & Furious series can be counted on to deliver what it promises on the box: gleaming cars, thrilling chases, and buff stars who look like they've stepped out of the pages of a fitness magazine. The new installment, Fast & Furious 6 is just as dumb as the previous films, and its action scenes so furiously edited that it's hard to tell who's doing what, and to whom. But, as we've come to learn, that's the charm of these moviesthe stunts are outrageous, and the plot basic enough for an eight-year-old to enjoy.The new film opens with our heroes Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) enjoying their retirement, when federal agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) shows up to recruit them in a mission to capture professional hijacker Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). The incentive for Don is a possible reunion with his ex, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who was presumed dead at the end of the fourth film and who now may be working with Shaw.Director Justin Lin packs the film with back-to-back chases and set-pieces, never giving you a moment to ponder over the fact that you have no idea till the end, exactly what our villain is after – some codes are mentioned, but never clearly explained. The action itself is outrageous, and whether we're seeing real stunts or special effects, or a cocktail of both, it's pretty entertaining stuff. Cars are flipped like pancakes every few seconds, an armored tank creates carnage on a bridge, and an airplane is demolished in the climax.For those who enjoy their action a little more gritty, you'll be happy to know Gina Carano (Mixed Martial Arts star, and leading lady of Steven Soderbergh's Haywire) is cast as Hobbs' sidekick, and she gets down and dirty in a thrilling girl-on-girl fistfight with Rodriguez in the London Underground.Don't expect any improvement in the dialogue – the actors still mouth lines that appear to have been stolen from bumper stickers – and the performances are basically a range of stock expressions: angry, very angry, mad as hell.At 2 hours and 11 minutes, it's a little too long, and even the most devoted action-movie fans will sense the exhaustion creeping in. But don't leave until you've caught that post- credits cameo from a popular British star who sets up next year's seventh installment.I'm going with seven ratings for Fast & Furious 6. It's loud and noisy, and a lot of fun even if it doesn't make much sense.",visheshvijay,8/4/13,2013
46,2,This is an opinion review,"I walked into the cinema expecting to write something about this being the must see film for the weekend, remembering the nostalgia of the original and the progressively worse but still kinda cool sequels (except for that abortion Tokyo Drift we'd all like to forget we saw) and the redeeming previous installment Fast Five that somehow redeemed and reinvented the franchise introducing 'The Rock' as a kick-ass anti-hero and started the franchise on a remarkably cool path with fast paced action that was grounded with a great balance of realism and ""plausible"" suspension of belief.What I walked away with was having my mind raped by the worse script (CENSORED) It is near impossible to believe this is the same writer and director duo from Fast Five - but then they were also responsible for Tokyo Drift. Firstly, for some reason they have dropped all of the iconic moments that we have come to love and expect. There is no action packed opening scene filled with car chases and metal carnage. Instead we are treated to being teased with a quick race where nothing happens and shown the aftermath of what must've been an incredible heist, and then, when we eventually do get to see some car chase scenes we quickly realize that they have also done away with those camera shots that weave in and out of the cars putting you in the center of the action.Gone is the great balance of realism and ""plausible"" suspension of belief and instead Furious 6 was written with absolutely no regard to physics or common sense. It's one thing to have cars flipped over by driving head first into them with a ramp attached to the car, its another thing entirely to have bobbies keeping pace with a super fast custom F1 type of thing and almost overtaking it. But that's small compared to the crap they actually came up with for this movie. Think super fast chase scenes with a tank (oxymoronic) and people flying through the air superman style like neo catching a damsel in distress mid air after being flung from... I'm just gonna stop there. Have your eyes raped spoiler free but don't blame me for the loss of reasoning skills as you're trying to forget to think all together just so you can soak up the visual aspects of this redonculous spectacle.It's actually infuriating to watch a movie with some cool bits while realizing the absurdity of what you are expected to swallow.At one point there's this huge cargo plane landing on a runway but keeps cruising so it can take off again and this 20min action scene develops with cars driving into the cargo hold of the plane and fighting erupting everywhere, in the plane, around the plane and it never runs out of runway, for over 20 minutes. Now call me crazy but at some point everyone in the cinema turned to each other and said this is ridiculous, we all as a unit got up and refused to have our intelligence mocked while expecting to sit through this crap and we burned the place to the ground.Here's some math: a typical airliner cruises at about 160mph for takeoff. 160 ÷ 60 x 20 = a 53.3 mile long runway.The best thing about the movie was the fighting between the female characters. That's probably because they cast MMA star Gina Carano opposite Michelle Rodriguez.Will this be one of those movies you love to hate or is it simply too mind numbingly $#*&?",dewetnmail,7/27/13,2013
51,8,"Fast Cars, Tanks and Planes Oh My","If you want to talk about epic Fast and Furious 6 push the series to a whole new level.

Just when you think they couldn't take the series with raising the bar Fast and Furious 6 will leave you going WOW.

It was awesome to see in theaters they really push it to the same level as Fast 5.

The action and cars really shows that Fast and Furious is here to stay.

Justin Lin the director of Fast and Furious 6 really took the movie to a new level and knew how to keep the action and stunts excellent.

With the story taking place some time after Fast 5 you see Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his new girlfriend Elena (Elsa Pataky) enjoying the high life while Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and Mia (Jordana Brewster) become parents with a son.

However things take a twist when Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) finds Brian and Dominic asking for their help Hobbs show Dom that Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is still alive and running with a crew lead by Shaw (Luke Evans) The main antagonist of the movie.

In exchange for their help Hobbs agrees to give them all full pardons along with their team Roman (Tyrese Gibson) Han (Sung Kang) Gisele (Gal Gadot) Tej (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges). Hobbs has a new partner Riley (Gin Carano) as well.

The movie took action and stunts to a whole new level and that they were bringing everything to the screen planes, fast cars and they got a tank wow.

They used a good amount of humor as well which helps out as well.

This is the fourth Fast and Furious movie I saw in theaters and really am proud to saw I loved it.

So I recommend any fan of movies and cars to see this movie.

I give Fast and Furious 6 an 8 out of 10",Terryfan,12/31/13,2013
53,10,Back to the roots!,"After the last of fast and furious i was a little afraid this number 6 would also be one big fight and gun movie instead of a core streetrace and car based movie. But they definitely surprised me when i saw this movie yesterday they are more back to there roots like in the first 3 movies with a lot of racing and cars all over the movie! Than add lots of humor and great looking girls, locations, cars and weapons and a long with all the amazing actor's you get this astonishing movie!!I Say GREAT Job to the maker of this movie and keep up the good combination of all elements and especially the racing part as this is the core of the movie and not shooting and fighting like there was a little to much on 4 and 5.I cant wait until the new upcoming number 7 with Jason Statham!",vausma,5/24/13,2013
54,6,"You get what you expect, as long as you don't expect much","Movies from the Fast and Furious franchise always bring up the same problem. If the cars are fast enough and the explosions are big enough, is the fact that there are uninteresting characters and a brainless story irrelevant? After all, people see these movies for the action, and in the case of Fast Six, it delivers handily. But newcomers to the Fast and Furious world that long for an intelligent story in their movies may want to stay as far away as possible, because the plot in Fast Six is a dud. What it all boils down to is that the most loyal devotees of the franchise will find lots to enjoy, but it won't be making many new fans either. This really is a shame, especially because last year's Fast Five made me a believer in a film series I had long thought had no sign of life.This isn't to say that the movie is terrible. In some ways it even exceeds Fast Five. Vin Diesel's (back as Dominic Toretto) stone-faced acting and deep monotone is an almost welcome sight at this point, as it has become a staple of the franchise; and Dwayne Johnson as Hobbs is as entertaining as ever. Like in all the Fast and Furious movies, the acting is best when the fists do the talking. The movie has some clever throwbacks to Johnson's wrestling days and just visualizing Vin Diesel's flying head-butt brings a smile to my face. An excellent call was made in casting Gina Carano as Hobb's partner Riley. She may have very few lines, but her fight scenes are incredible. If you haven't, see her in last year's Haywire which is tremendously underrated.The dialog, which has often inflicted this franchise like a plague, has been greatly improved this time around. Don't be fooled, it still isn't great, but the clichés and bad jokes have for the most part been eradicated. One of the most impressive amendments the film makes is the strength of the banter between the principle cast, which is among the most glaring issues with its predecessors. This is especially true in regards to the back-and-forth antics of Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Ludacris), both of which I had originally hoped they wouldn't bring back for this sequel. I was prepared to be annoyed by them, but was pleasantly surprised by their genuinely witty jokes. I also thought it was a smart move to not bring back every single character from the previous films. Fast Five was largely unsuccessful in juggling its many characters. This time, there's just the right amount of characters for the film to play with, so longtime fans needn't worry as most of their favorite characters are back and have more screen time.The problems with Fast Six are rooted in its story that defies logic and the absurd melodrama and pointless twists that accompany it. The plot reads as nothing more than a bad soap opera with Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) being brought back from the dead and suffering from amnesia. The amnesia ends up playing out solely as a vehicle for inconsequential drama with no regard to the actual affects amnesia would have. Equally outrageous, is the film's villain Shaw (Luke Evans), who is the antithesis to everything Toretto believes and stands for. His motivations are as unoriginal as they come and his actions are so questionable you wonder how this guy was so hard to catch in the first place. Let's not forget he also has his own ragtag team of criminals that mirror Toretto's. It's not a compliment. The film even refers to them (out loud) as their evil twins, so you know in true melodramatic fashion, they each have to fight their own counterpart in the climax. I really do wish I was making all this up.Far too often the film resides in sentimentality. Toretto constantly addresses how important his makeshift ""family"" is to him; a nice message for sure, but the constant reminders lessen the impact. In the film's most cringe worthy scene, Shaw argues the flaws of Toretto's belief, which begs the question of why he even cares. As is par for the course for the Fast and Furious movies, the characters have little depth. Only fans of the series can enjoy them, but only because they've been exposed to them for six films; it's merely a side effect.If you can stomach the bad, the movie can be very rewarding. After all, this is an action film, and that is what it does best. The film has more of the physics defying action that is so beloved in the Fast and Furious universe. Particularly, the two set pieces in the last forty minutes, which include a tank AND a plane, are worth seeing the movie for alone. It reminded me of why I liked Fast Five so much. Because the best parts of the movie are crammed in at the end, the rest of the film suffers as a result. It would have been better to see something more grandiose in the first ninety minutes that would grab my attention and hold it throughout the film, similar to Fast Five. I got the impression that after how over-the-top fun Fast Five's ending was, director Justin Lin felt that the only way to up the ante was to make everything bigger. But part of the joy of Fast Five's climax was how wonderfully original it was conceived. It is proof that bigger isn't always better.With all the highs and lows taken into account, Fast Six equates into nothing more than a noisy ""OK"". What is most frustrating of all is that after Fast Five injected some much needed energy into this lifeless franchise, that this one doesn't quite carry the torch. But with quite an intriguing cliffhanger (stick through the credits), I'm hopeful for next year's installment.",Engenius,6/11/13,2013
55,10,Action Franchise Isn't Out of Gas Yet,"Action Franchise Isn't Out of Gas Yet Fast & Furious 6, as the title implies, is the sixth installment in the long-running action film series. Viewers should put on their seat belts and get ready for over two hours worth of joyriding. Vehicular mayhem never looked this good�so good, in fact, the producers apparently felt compelled to tag a disclaimer on the reel before the credits begin to roll. The film series started out as a vehicle (pun intended) for then-burgeoning action actor Vin Diesel (an apropos surname given the film setting). Since the first film premiered in 2001, it has grown to encompass several more co-stars in its subsequent sequels, leading into its current incarnation as a multicultural ensemble of drag-racing avengers.

This time around, Diesel's Dominic Toretto and former adversary-turned-brother-in-law Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) are visited by globetrotting Interpol agent Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) and presented with the proverbial offer they can't refuse: Letty (Michelle Hernandez), a heretofore deceased member of Toretto's crew, was recently seen helping out internationally-wanted criminal Shaw (Luke Evans). Shaw's team of outlaws use similar car-heavy tactics to pull off their heists, and so if Toretto's squad can beat them at their own game, a full pardon�and a reunion with Letty�is the reward. So the Fast & Furious team comes back again for one last job.

The object of Shaw's affection is the film's MacGuffin: a computer database that can disable military security systems. It's fair to say, however, that this is entirely irrelevant to the film, as this screen franchise has built its brand on wilder-than-impossible stunt sequences and the interplay between Toretto's team: chatterbox Roman (Tyrese Gibson), gizmo guru Tej (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges), laid-back Han (Sung Kang) and tough-girl Gisele (Gal Gadot). Another tag-along this time is Hobb's right-hand agent Riley (Gina Carano), who gets to showcase her real-life UFC fighting skills in several confrontations.

This is one of the best comic-book films of the year that aren't based on a comic (screenplay credit goes to Chris Morgan). Despite the relatively threadbare plot (and settings that hip-hop from Moscow to Los Angeles to London and more), director Justin Lin keeps everything from being the flailing mess that it might otherwise be in lesser hands. Sweeping, wide-camera views of urban cityscapes and chasm-spanning bridges help add to the spectacle, and the climax is as exhilarating as it is shamelessly over-the-top. If the epilogue is any indicator, the close-ups of gear-shifting and revving engines definitely haven't ended.

56,7,"It's dumb fun, and proud of it.","I can honestly say that going into Fast & Furious 6, my expectations weren't exactly high. This is one film series that has gone on for way too long. But America just keeps going to these demolition derbies, and they simply just aren't for me. But even I can't deny that I had a good time at the latest entry in the series. There is not a boring second in the damn thing. Plenty of stupid ones, but none boring. That is the thing about these movies: They are dumb, and they know it, and I admire that.

This time around, Hobbs (The Rock) asks Dom and Brian (Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, mainly here for a paycheck) to track down a guy named Shaw(Luke Evans). He promises them that if they succeed, he can give them a pardon. They don't want to do it, but one thing gets them on board: Dom's supposed dead wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is working for Shaw. Say what?

At times, it is over the top. But isn't that the point? There are some spectacular action sequences here, and basically everything else that you expect from these movies. The ass kickings (mainly left for MMA fighter Gina Carano from last year's under seen Haywire), the babes, the explosions. This is a movie that knows how to blow stuff up real good, and proud of it.

It is mindlessly entertaining, but I even gave into it this time. I liked it. Sue me, I don't care. It is a lot of fun. It is a good way to kill two hours. Hell, four hours. You may want to watch it twice in a row. Fast & Furious 6 is a lot of fun, and it actually sort of leaves you pumped for the 7th. Is the series overkill? Sure. Eliminate entries 2-4, and you have yourself a decent series. It isn't as good as something like Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol or Skyfall, but the actors are all having a good time. So is the audience. I can't believe I am saying this, but see it. I doubt my opinion will sway you, because you probably already have.

62,6,Two bald men have a bromance!,"The Fast Family are all grown up, they've come a long way since we first met them back in the ancient days of yore, it fair brings a tear to one's eye.

'Loveable' idiot Roman is poncing around on a private jet full of smashing birds, Han is in Japan eating some Spam, Tej is giving away his dollars like they are Specsavers 2-4-1 flyers, Dom is getting over Letty by getting his leg over Elena. Brian has even had a baby. Well I never! Everything is going just fabulously until anally-retentive lunatic Hobbs (yup it's the Rock) shows up with a recent photo of Letty claiming that everyone's favourite scowly- faced Latina has been sighted in London guv'ner! After muttering some clever things about needing wolves to hunt wolves Hobbs scuttles off for a word with Dom, it seems there is a nasty terrorist/crime-lord/Englishman running around London stealing gizmos to build a world exploding machine. Unable to resist the Letty-bait, Dom assembles his troops and off the Fast Clan go to dreary old England to find Letty, save the world and earn themselves pardons.

Next as ever, there are some car chases in some lovely shiny auto mobiles, a street race, an impressive range of ladies bottoms to gawp at and some funky music. Rita Ora pops up at one point like a sparkly street-race fairy to plant her magical seal of coolness fully on the baldy bonce of 40-something Dom. There are some fantastic fights between the Fast ladies in particular Letty and Riley in an epic battle of camel-toe fury which must be seen to be believed. There are laughs aplenty often at Roman's expense, it also seems that the Fast crew's nickname for Hobbs is 'Samoan Thor' which weirdly does suit him.

For Fast fans, there is more of the same Fast formula- and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, if it ain't broke don't fix it. What makes this particular outing in the Fast saga distinct from all of the others however is a beautiful bromance between Dom and Hobbs which punctuates the narrative from beginning to end. This culminates in full male bonding toward the conclusion of the piece. The emotional depth and authentic beauty of this relationship should not be underestimated. This element of the plot is also a twist as after all this time I was truly expecting that Dom would finally get it on with the Dodge Charger or maybe the Mustang. It seems that the love that dares not speak it's name 'twixt man and car must be reserved for the inevitable sequel.

Fast 6 is exceptionally entertaining. If you are a human and you have eyes you will probably find it an enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours. It is also exceptionally silly. This is a film which is unapologetically about fun and escapism, it doesn't claim to be clever so do not expect it to be! If you sit down to watch it accepting these truths you will leave a very happy punter. If not don't bother.",sandiglendinning,6/16/13,2013
63,9,Amazingly faster and more furious than ever,"From the first Fast & Furious these films has been a great success. At first OK and good entertainment, and undeniably a good idea. The second two was a let down with too much sideways driving, but then things started happening again. The fifth outing Fast Five was surprisingly the best so far. It WAS fast & furious! The pace was excellent, the story was good and the driving was amazing. This sixth outing adds a lot to the last success, which made 630 million dollars in the cinemas only. The world's biggest car film franchise!F&F6 which premiered in London a week before the rest, due to London being the base here, is ferociously faster and more furious than ever. The only thing that doesn't take off here, is the plane in the end! F&F6 is starring some of the most amazing sports cars classic car lovers adore. This time also European super-cars!The amazing British handmade Jensen Interceptor, the ultra rare Dodge Charger Daytona made in only 300 ex (though here in a replica) and the sporting legend of a every day classic, the Ford Escort RS2000 are tangled in together with the well known Mustang and Corvette. You'll also find a Plymouth Barracuda, a 2011 Dodge Charger, A Nissan GTR, BMW M5, Alfa Romeo and Aston Martin is also present. Put into the mix the most classic tank driving since James Bond drowned his in Russia, sadly enough crushing a Mustang, and you got a driving focused classic which is even better than the Fast Five!This is a continuation of Fast Five, and some kind of prequel to the first. Impressive action stunts, fast cars, sexy entertainment, well acted by the crew we've grown to like so much. Amazing driving action is the driving force of this film, containing a car chase on a long strip against a plane, and a long carcasses a city night. I love that Gina Carano is added to the crew. This is so right it can possible be. This seems to be an unstoppable success story, which will continue to bring classic drivers cars out of oblivion, making new fast for the old classics which should be preserved for the future in a world where cars are looking like bars of soap.As long as this franchise can keep up with the feel good action and showing the use of nasty cars and chic girls combined with an effective story which includes the classic car chases, this will deliver the thrills.What will be the cars in the seventh outing? I bet for a Monteverdi, most certainly a Maserati and a nice TWR. I'd sure love to see more of the Jensen Interceptor, so may I suggest a four wheel drive FF-battle between Jensen FF racing against a Ferrari FF? I suggest the name FF7 - Fast & Furious Four Wheel Drive!Don't leave the cinema too early. In an extra clip you'll get a little glimpse of what to expect in the next episode, and who's the obvious bad guy in this. Well, we just have to wait a year, because the seventh is on a year from now. Enjoy the rides! I sure did!",OJT,5/13/13,2013

So much action sequences made air so concentrated with testosterone you could actually hang hatchet in thin airspace.'No metaphor here' Car chase sections = extremely well made. It's so nice to see on screen some nicely filmed scenes than relaying heavily on CG(Yeah they use CG too I know I know).

Bad sides: Story - you know they are 'like living like kings, but something is missing, so we should put our lives on line'. Okay it's not this film's biggest flaw. ""Huge spoiler starts"" Silliness - Luke Evan tells them to release him and give him the chip because he has Jordana hostage and they actually do it and like 5 minutes later they are trying to arrest him. Yeah I know I'm not telling everything I felt like that was the ""facepalmness"" moment in whole film. Amnesia - well I actually was hoping for the most part of film that 'she' was faking it but even if she would it wouldn't make much sense.

Neutral(I'm not sure if it's bad or good) - 'The true end' with Statham and Han's death. It's nice to know there's going to next movie but if that was the best way? ""Huge spoiler ends""

Conclusion: All in all a great fast popcorn-flicky film. Really feel that tank chase should have been longer and film itself should have been longer in order to explain some things a little bit better. + Some extra funny moments Franchise is doing great I feel that one of following 7,8,9 part will be so great that I will sleep with it's DVD under my pillow and just next to my teddy bear.",notaufo,5/23/13,2013
66,7,Action Overdose,"OK this film is worth watching, however the older you are the more you will be put off by the quantity of action in it.Everyone managed to have at least one worthy performance. Although some of the better actors managed to perform well throughout the entire film.For me the disappointment was with Bruce Willis and the quiet Chinese guy. They were the most unconvincing performances.Like bad roller coaster rides, the kind that do more than just excite/thrill you, by the end of the ride you feel sick and never want to go on it again. This also describes this film's viewing experience.If only they could beef up the script, tone down the action, stop putting in, so called ""cash magnet"" actors like Bruce Willis, (that really should retire.) Add some depth along with a more sophisticated soundtrack. They would have made a one-to-remember type film.I normally do not like ""the Rock"" however in this film he does one of his best and believable performances! I really liked Vin Petrol too, he was awesome in this film and I wish he would act in more credible titles. The guy that plays the baddie is very good, once again proving he is around to stay.Anyway all in all a good movie, one that requires zero brain power to process, yet not quite boring enough to send you to sleep half way through.Summary A cliché feel good action flick.Questions... Is it worth cinema viewing? - No; Is it worth buying? - No! Therefore wait until it is on the TV or hire it out when there are no more ""Big Titles"" left to watch. ;)",killgamers,7/7/13,2013
67,5,I don't get how this and the previous installment were so well received. They're utterly stupid.,"A rare film that I saw in the theater and barely remembered I saw it just a few hours later. Honestly, I had no interest in it, was just with family over Memorial Day weekend and had a free ticket anyway. Still, what a waste of time. Who cares about the plot? Whenever the characters are talking between action sequences, it's pure torture. Who gives a crap what these people are saying? The action sequences themselves are somewhat amusing, but they aren't really that good. Too much editing, leading to occasional confusion. Physics are completely ignored. Momentum, inertia, gravity: fuhgetaboutit. When I watched the fifth F&F movie, which I did because it actually got very good reviews somehow, I thought to myself, eh, maybe I disliked it because I was watching it at home alone, which is clearly not the right environment. But hanging out with family and seeing the sixth one with an audience, yeah, I think they really do suck (though, truth be told, I remember enjoying the first one, which I saw on video with my brother when it came out).",zetes,6/2/13,2013
69,7,"As if swanky cars weren't enough, Fast and Furious now have 'Tank' rampaging the roads—and, you are in for one hell of a ride!","Yipin (Justin) Lin nails another F&F movie. The 6th installment doesn't just pick the tempo where Fast 5 concluded; it gets bigger too, and straightaway—no lag on plot development or character insights as it is already all set. From scene one you have fast cars in action, trailblazing through some beautiful locales.F&F also provides what was amiss in Fast 5—a real villain of credibility in Shaw (Luke Evans), well supported by his sidekicks who match (even betters) Dom's crew blow-by-blow, i.e., until the climax of course.Action in the film, as it was supposed to, overshadows all other aspect of the film but comedy, overall acting, editing, camera work, special effects, etc. gel well in this in this high octane showdown.All in all, a perfect summer blockbuster for action buffs.If the sneak-peek of F&F is anything to go by then the F&F 7 is going to be even 'massiver'—the newest addition (current tycoon of action films) to cast/franchise certainly indicates so! What more. Being a huge fan of Diesel's 'Riddick', I hope the success of F&F avails him enough riches to decently market/promote another potent, niche-focused, action/adventure franchise of his.7.5/10",YasheshJ,5/26/13,2013
70,7,Did not disappoint.,"The new installment in the fast and furious franchise delivers exactly what you would expect it to; a lot of humor, unbelievable(bordering on unrealistic) action, stale emotion and of course fast cars

The plot is based around the team getting back together after their successful Rio heist to help agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) catch an equally impressive group of international villains lead by mastermind Shaw(Luke Evans) to steal a high-tech government weapon. But the real reason that They agree to help is because Hobbs will give them free pardons all around and Dom can get Letty back.

I am extremely happy that unlike most franchises, fast and furious is at it's 6th movie and is still pleasing it's fans.In conclusion, if you have seen the previous fast and furious movies and enjoy seeing big explosions, flipping cars and classic buddy-cop type humor than sit back, relax and enjoy the movie.",Ksmithbrewer001-603-535593,6/9/13,2013
72,7,"Fast Paced Action, Furious Storyline","Wouldn't it be cool to be part of a group who after a brawl is left unscathed? They're like men taking stem cell capsules. FAST AND FURIOUS 6 was indeed fast it will make your neurons hyperventilate and furious because there is no stopping them. Yes my friends there is a 7th installment. It is one movie that you forget about the plot and concentrate instead in keeping your eyeballs intact, afraid that you'll have nystagmus in the end. It's high octane energy coupled with Vin Diesel flaccid drama, Tyrese effortless comedy and bits of love stories keep you at the edge of your seats. I am not in the position to fully evaluate the chronicity of action sequences per installment and chose which is way better because I have only seen two but nonetheless it gave me joy watching posh cars gone bad and enjoyed the death defying stunts. And what more to keep the franchise alive by surprisingly casting Jason Statham in the prequel. And I thought there's a movie remix entitled: THE FURIOUS TRANSPORTER. Since Jason Statham is one of my favorite actors but not to the point of idolatry, I will watch the sequel. When are they going to end this drama? Until they'll ran out of cars and use tricycles instead? Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go and inquire about their uber duper strength. Until the next fuel hike!",poet512,6/13/13,2013
73,9,Fast & Furious 6 Movie Review By Andrew Brauer,"It's crazy to see that this franchise has gone to a sixth entry, but what is even more surprising is that it's actually been getting better. The first four Fast & The Furious were pretty cheesy action movies that would cater to a certain demography, but when Fast Five came out in 2011, I was very surprised at how much fun I had with it, and If I did review movies back in 2011, that would've been on my Top 10 of Best for the year. Now two years later we have Fast & Furious 6, which takes place where Fast Five finished, Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew are living large as millionaires but Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) shows up and needs Dom's help, as a new group of criminals led by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) is after an important computer chip that could lead to a even bigger threat. But the big reason why Dom and his crew will help out, is because one of Shaw's right hand men is Dom's former lover Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) who died in one of the previous films, but turns out to not be dead. Dom, Brian, Roman, Tej, and everyone else returns to rescue Letty, and clear they're names for good. Now for starters, does this film have the greatest writing or acting in the world, of course not, but it is insanely fun and without a doubt one of the most entertaining films this year. This film is extremely well directed with Justin Lin (Fast Five) at the helm, the action sequences look incredible and every time something big and exciting was about to happen, I was pumped up and was giggling with excitement. In fact, the final action sequence is one of the coolest action scenes I've witnessed in a long time. The pacing is also quick and hardly slows down, whereas for the story is simple and hardly focuses on it, unless it involves the overall message about family and togetherness. Fast & Furious 6 has what was missing out of Pacific Rim, which the problem with Pacific Rim was too much story, not enough action, Fast & Furious 6 is all action, little story, and it works so well. The acting is fine, everyone has been doing these movies for a while so they know what their doing and they do it well. The humor is great as several times I cracked up (most of it is from the comic relief of Tyrese Gibson's Roman), the soundtrack is great, and although the writing is pretty silly, it does serve for some truly perfect quotes. Problems are that logic is thrown out the window for this film, if you think more than you watch, you'll just hate watching this because hardly anything makes sense. And some scenes around the middle go on a little too long, especially the prison scene. But Fast & Furious 6 is comfortable with what kind of film it is, a silly, over the top, but extremely entertaining crowd pleaser. I haven't this much fun with a movie in a long time, all you need to know is fast cars, hot girls, explosions, and muscles. Just leave your brain at home and enjoy the ride.",andrewbrauer96,11/24/13,2013
74,7,The 25+ mile long runway....,"Since Dom and Brian's Rio heist toppled an empire, and left their crew with $100 million, the team have scattered across the globe.

But their inability to return home and living forever on the run have left their lives incomplete.

Hobbs has been tracking an organisation of skilled drivers across the globe, whose mastermind is aided by the love Dom thought was dead, Letty.

The only way to stop the criminal outfit is to outmatch them at street level, so Hobbs asks Dom to assemble his elite team in London. Payment.....

This franchise shouldn't work. Parts two and three were utter tripe, and then whoosh! Its a turnaround for a franchise I've never seen before, and Lin has struck gold, because he knows what he audience want, fun, action, and more car chases.

And that's what the film delivers, car chase, fight, people in room sweaty and being serious, Tyrese cracking a joke with Ludicrous, and repeated again for the running time.

The film is bonkers, its absolutely crazy, and I found myself laughing at the absurdity of it all, from Bobby Ewing in Dallas shock return for Letty, to Doms rescue of Letty from the tank, which has to be the stupidest thing I've literally seen on screen.

But I had a cracking time watching it, the cast are great, Diesel and Walker funnily enough are the least interesting of the characters, but the rest are brilliant, and Gibson and Bridges steal the movie from everyone.....who is credited in the cast....

Johnson is beyond muscular and just destroys everything in his path, and just as you think Ling couldn't do anything more bizarre, he brings a tank into the film, and Jason Statham....

I've not been the biggest fan of the franchise, but this was big dumb, stupid fun, and I enjoyed every minute of it.

I just hope Universal release a trailer for the next film, without giving the whole thing away....",FlashCallahan,7/14/13,2013
77,1,Why don't they make something different ? Always the same old.,"***************************** SPOILERS*********************************

Instead of writing a boring review about this adrenaline filled , fast paced,at times headache inducing movie i'd just write a list of clich�s it contains :-

1.Like every movie nowadays that promises action ,f6 has no 'well thought plot'. The mindless plot is there just to get to the car sequences and over the top special effects and stunts.

2.There are too many characters that we don't care about. Most of them, like the two black guys are there purely for the one liners although they do work sometimes.

3.A previously 'dead' character is actually ALIVE. OMFG i could never have thought of that. And his/her entire life memory is wiped. CLEVER!!

4.One of the guys has a wife and a kid and you could tell from the beginning that one of them will later on be kidnapped just to throw on us one more nauseous chase sequence.

5.One cop actually turns out to be a bad guy. How do they come up with this stuff!!

6.At one stage the cop hobbs (johnson) could shoot antagonist (luke evans) right in the face and spare us an hour or so but doesn't. ""See you at the chase while you'll be pancaking civilians with your stolen tank and firing a few regular missiles"".

7.In the end everything turns out right.I mean cmon thats genius. None of the 'important good guys' lose anything and get their records cleaned. Although the Asian guy loses his girlfriend because she is killed horribly but that does not stop everyone from enjoying beer and steaks in the end.

8.Dont even get me started on the runway.

However there was good stuff too.

1.Sceneries

2.Cars

Anyways, There is a final scene when a 'new bad guy' makes an appearance. Oh yes we're not yet done with this franchise. However that appearance was stunning!

To conclude, only watch if you are a fan of this franchise and love brainless, plot less action.

78,7,The Best One Yet!,"Yes, I am aware of the fact I have written ""The Best One Yet!"" and only gave it a seven out of ten. Yes, I loved the movie but it did not exceed all my expectations. The length, well, it was very long. I wouldn't be bothered about the length but this film did not amaze me, and I wasn't prepared to see more. The plot. I liked it, but there was a flaw. Yes, it was about cars and racing, but unlike all the other ones, this had the least of it. It definitely shouldn't have been titled ""Fast and Furious 6"", it should be ""Chasing Shaw"", which includes a hint of cars, but the main idea of this film. The acting. It was good. But, it didn't make me feel like I was there, to be honest, I felt the only scenes that blew my mind were the very visual ones that included stunts, action, or humor, but otherwise I felt it was to..to self-centered on the plot, (MUCH different than what I expected) where the characters weren't able to do what they were meant to, and it made a big impact on the movie.In conclusion, Fast & Furious 6 was an outstanding film with some flaws that definitely effect my opinion, but yet I do encourage you to see the film yourself. Most people liked it much more than I did, and with the box office total just for the past few days, I think that you would like it as well as mostly everyone else.",jagsports01,5/28/13,2013
81,8,What a great surprise!,"I'm a big fan of the Fast & Furious franchise, but since the last movie (Rio) i was like ""it's a good action movie, but it had lost its essence"". Now, after watching F&F 6, i've the feeling that one part of the original story is back. The cars have a bigger role (now they can be called secondary characters), but still isn't the same as F&F , F&F 2 and F&F Tokio. All the characters (specially Dom, Brian, Hobbs and Letty) were well created, respecting their origins and explaining some important details from the past movies. I've rated 8 for some reasons: 1) action sequences that goes against gravity in so many ways; 2) it's a little too long; 3) the cars and races still have a secondary role.In general it's a great action movie, with a good plot, nice races, really funny (thanks Roman!) and exciting. If you're a big fan of F&F, why haven't you watched yet?? If you're not a fan, but like action movies, i strongly recommend it!Hope this review helps!",lucena-neto,5/25/13,2013
82,7,The coolest gang is back !,"Following Fast Five and its post-credit scene, this was the most hyped summer movie. And it did justify it somewhat, with me being edged to the seat throughout its 130 minute run.Its different from any other action series for having a gang that is family and has a code, primarily laid out by Dom. It increases its grip by nostalgic moments from its prequels (""We Own It"") and is incredibly fast (amazing action sequences). Some of it is non-realistic, but we won't term it as no-brainy. Yes it does have its weak moments, but it'll still be termed as 'Must Watch'.Though best movie in the series still remains the 2001 original, this is pretty awesome. Without revealing much, do enjoy this and whatever you do, don't leave your seat till the credits roll, believe me!",iamshauryataneja,6/3/13,2013
83,8,Totally worth it! and gets you ready for Fast 7..,"Unlike other movie series, this movie wont disappoint you for a bit. Keeps you on the edge of the seat most of the time and at times takes you to totally relaxing mood, like coming back home.Action packed, fast paced with a touch of romance and giggles, Fast 6 opens up an entire new platform for explosive movies. Though you will find Vin Diesel getting older he still has got some good fights to enthrall you. Rock is as usual his best, you may wonder if he is just coming out of gym working out. There are 2 action sequences that you must not miss. And also the last 1 minute... and finally a piece of advice. Its one of the movies that you should not miss watching on the big screen, so don't wait for the DVDs/torrents to come out.

84,7,"Hard To Believe, But Who Comes to These Movies for a Plot?","A group of steroid pumped car drivers attempt to save the world. Really.

PROS: By all accounts, Paul Walker was a nice fellow. I'd give the movie a couple stars for that. And if you like seeing stuff blow up, lots of it, and can completely suspend belief, you will enjoy this testosterone laced car show.

CONS: Let me start by saying that this isn't the type of movie I would typically be drawn to. It's loud and brash at the expense of characters. There are few ideas worth exploring. In fact, there are no ideas of any sort. But the entire DIE HARD series descended down a similar rabbit hole, with each successive sequel getting louder and more ridiculous, and these remained fun. If you like fancy cars and the notion that the world can be saved by speedy driving, then you will love this movie.",georgeislive21,12/29/13,2013
85,8,Kept me at the edge of my seat,"Although I'm not a hardcore fan of this franchise, I did watch all of its titles and frankly speaking this installment kept me at the edge of my seat for a good two hours of actions, except maybe for the somewhat lengthy and awkward but fortunately rare conversational scenes. I like the breath-taking and adrenaline rush of the 'unusual' car-chase scenes, which have already been revealed in the trailer, involving F1 cars, a tank and even a plane. As for the speed rush, you'll just have to watch it yourself. I also enjoyed the little bit of reminisce in classic scenes here and there, as well as some humorous scenes involving mostly Tyrese. Got to give it to him for the laughs.I don't mind the fact that there's more of Dwayne Johnson but I'm actually quite disappointed with Paul Walker's underplayed role. Vin Diesel could also use a bit more facial and non-verbal expressions. Overall I find it as one of the best installment of the franchise, and definitely a good watch if you're a typical action flick fan. 8 from me as it certainly tops my action movies list of the year, but pretty straight-forward and not quite yet to reach a 'legendary' status that movies like The Matrix and Rambo enjoys.Oh and special credits to the production team for the bridge scene and the teaser for the next installment (remember to stay seated when the credit starts to roll!)",tzmmalaysia,5/27/13,2013
87,3,"My 12 year old brother enjoyed this film, I, however, did not.","We all know the Fast and Furious 6 franchise has become less and less about the cars over the series, so there is no point in moaning about that now. As an action packed film, and the occasional race which forcefully became relevant to the story, Fast and Furious 6 is great. However, the realism of this film was just dreadful, Star Wars was more believable when Yoda came back as a ghost. I noticed three loopholes in the story myself, that's while my friend sat next to me tapping me on the shoulder every 10 seconds to point out another clich�. If you have seen the other films in this series then you can pretty much work out for yourselves what is going to happen. Growing up with this series I really wanted to leave a good review, but I just can't. Overall, if you enjoyed the other films, just want an action packed film and can leave your brain at the door then this movie is great.

The sad thing is that they really believe the nonsense they are peddling. More's the pity. Apparently, they'd rather lie to both you and to themselves.

This movie franchise works on the formula of - Fast Cars, Hot Girls, Fast Action, Grey shaded Characters, Comedy. But since the FF5 movie, something changed. Things got bigger and better. Dwane Johnson joined the crew. And what a boost he gave to this franchise. Dwane and Vin Diesel, face to face was awesome. Also the main attention in the movie has shifted to action scenes involving huge vehicles and environments. Sometimes unbelievable, but 100% enjoyable. Also the level of special effects has improved.

91,7,"Just for entertainment, nothing more","There is nothing I could say about ""Fast and Furious 6"" besides a fun movie with dumb storyline. I must admit that the action scenes in this movie is bigger and cooler than other previous series but in storyline, ""Fast Five"" is much better. ""Furious Six"" undeniably has more action sequences, car crashing and bigger explosions which is fun to see in the summer season. It's what all ""Fast and Furious"" fans expected to be. Besides that massive action stuff, there's nothing left you could expect from this movie. The quality of storyline is so bad and dumb that makes this movie goes nowhere and no different from their previous franchise. The more you think, the more you feel silly about this movie. For example, the scenes when Brian pretending goes to jail for searching information about Letty that even their team and Toretto himself had already known about it before Brian told them, so what does he go to jail for? The cast in ""Furious Six"" are also flat and standard. As Indonesian people, I'm really proud of Joe Taslim for his first Hollywood movie debut. I know that he doesn't speak much but it's just enjoyable to see him fighting and taking quite important role. Overall, ""Furious Six"" is kind of good movie to see this summer and one of the great one from the series.

93,6,Disappointed by this installment of the series,"I haven't been this disappointed with the Fast and Furious series in a long time.

The movie was slow and it seemed the action was to over the top with no plot or driver to make it interesting.

The end of the movie *spoiler alert* was the most disappoint in my opinion.

I couldn't by into the almost footnote less death of one of the main supporting characters. They didn't search for her in the aftermath, nothing she is just.. dead.

I couldn't understand how any plane could.

1) Fly into a foreign country. 2) Attempt a touch and go at a NATO base which is basically another countries military airport in another country. 3) How long was that run way?? 20 Miles? Even the runway the shuttle lands on at NASA was shorter that this mythical runway. 4) Mia's capture and the return of Torreto's GF both of these events could have been done better.

Now I can understand the need to play out the Han character and tie in his death with the other movie FF2. I also like the cliffhanger they left for FF7, you know there is going to be one.

I just believe that there was a lot there that should have been organized better. I liked the action in the movie. Yet, at the end of the movie most of it was unbelievable.

Its just for me, the amount of unbelievable action and the lack of plot substance took away from the film. I hope FF7 will be better.",de-vaughn-elledge,5/29/13,2013
95,7,"Fun, Fast, Family Filim","""You don't turn your back on family, even when they do."" Are the words spoken by Dominic Toretto (Diesel) and becomes the motto of Fast 6. Justin Lin creates another adrenaline-filled, action packed movie once again. We see all sorts of familiar faces, but we're also introduced to a few new characters as well. Characters including the new mastermind, Owen Shaw (Evens). Shaw leads his team of thieves as they try to get their hands on a Nightshade device that is capable of blocking out communication signals for up to 24 hours. This device is worth billions of dollars to the right buyer and Shaw knows it. Feeling threatened by the capabilities of this device, Hobbs goes to Toretto and his gang for help on keeping it out of Shaw's hands. They agree to work for Hobbs under 1 condition: Amnesty, so they can return back to their home in the U.S. The film is full of action packed stunts that aren't the most believable, but they will keep you on the edge of your seat and wanting more. Fast 6 was a very entertaining movie that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It has fast cars that will amaze the children, nice looking women that will keep the men satisfied, and even a little romance for the ladies. It also has some humor and expresses the importance of family and what a family can overcome for one another in a fun, action packed way.",s_hamilton_32,5/29/13,2013
96,8,Contains what we loved from the first movies....Street racing!,"After many years, won't the ""Fast and Furious"" makers give up the series. They have always wanted to keep their fans close and updated, by making more movies. The problem by making more movies to a series, is that they always have to bring something new to the movie. They get fewer new ideas, and end often by ""copying"" another movie from the series and make it a bit different. Those movies get hated and sells bad. But in the 6th movie of the ""Fast and Furious"" series, they give us something old and new, and it's exciting at the same time. In the 5th movie there were more action and a lack of street racing. In the 6th movie they've tried to go back to the street racing, and they succeeded! I felt like I was back in the first movies, the cars, the noises, hell yeah even the chicks were back! They even tried to combine both street racing and the action, WHICH was not a disappointment at all! The story is simple, stop the bad guys from doing something bad, but even if the story is that simple, it's pretty good told. There is always something that happens that will keep you focused. The effects are really great. There is nothing that is half done. Every actors and actresses play their roles excellent, especially hilarious Tyrese Gibson and the leading Vin Diesel.In short, the movie is great! I will recommend it for everybody that loves a good action movie, and for those who are big fans to the ""Fast and Furious"" movies.

After it had achieved takeoff speed, it was still struggling to take off for the next, what, 15 minutes? Was that run strip really 50 miles long? Note I didn't time the sequence, so my numbers might be off, but that's just an example of the extent of the ridiculousness.

By now, you know what to expect in terms of some sizable destruction of cars and assets, stunts that defy laws of physics and the scorching pace at which you can drive through densely populated cities. None of which is possible in reality but yet, there is something about this group that makes you want it to be real. Justin Lin has directed 3 of the more memorable F&F movies and this time too, he gets the combination accurately with just the right amount of hot women, sexy cars and high octane action. Buckle up for this fun ride. The opening sequence seems like a James Bond movie with a Dodge Challenger and Nissan Skyline racing along the Spanish coast, reflecting the carefree lives of now millionaires, Dominic and Brian. Shortly thereafter, Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) surprises Dominic with a visit and a motive (Letty lives!) to join forces to crackdown on Owen Shaw (Luke Evans)'s mercenaries who have performed a series of audacious heists to assemble a devastating weapon. Hobbs attempts to re-unite the team to take on Shaw on the street level and win full pardons for their past crimes. The action proceeds onto London's streets with Dom and Brian in hot pursuit of Shaw's mercenaries. Thereafter, Dom and his blast from the past, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) scorch the streets of London in an epic race that leads to the revelation that she survived the explosion a few movies ago but lost her memory. Shaw was the one who rescued her and hired her as his top mercenary. Following such an emotionally pleasing scene, we move on to Spain where the components of the Nightshade device are being transported to a secure location but the convoy is brutally attacked by Shaw's forces who also tear through the oncoming traffic in a tank along the highway. The team defy the laws of physics, create more destruction than some Decepticons and save each other in the name of being a family. The climactic action is on a never-ending military runway with the massive bomber aircraft being kept on ground by a handful of super-cars and heroes. The inaneness of the action is jarring but the actors make it all entertaining by giving their best in every ridiculous scene. One can also credit Lin for reviving these characters in 'Fast Five' and adding some richness to their bond to make us feel for them every time they defy physics. Justin Lin's fourth F&F venture is a super-charged engine aptly titled 'Furious 6' for it takes action, storyline, characterization and vehicular warfare to a higher level. As ridiculous as they may sometimes be, the sequences are bigger and more explosive with actors partaking in most of them. Hundreds of cars are sacrificed in the devastation that follows this team in their pursuit of Shaw and in their journey, we are given a better insight into their characters. When your expectations for a silly engine revving franchise are modest, the cars and humans can provide quite a rush of entertainment. Dwayne Johnson looks like the Hulk. He can only fit into army grade vehicles including the Hummer now but with G.I.Joe and F&F franchises, he's made his mark in the genre as the massive Rock of action. Vin Diesel's career is all about Dominic Toretto now. With few dialogues and more stunts, his talent is optimized by this franchise. Paul Walker could've been an unknown were it not for his partnership with Diesel in their car chases. With fewer dialogues and subtle emotions of being a father, Walker does justice to his role and no more. Michelle Rodriguez is badass in this film. Apart from some MMA fighting with Gina Carano, Letty also gets to shoot and drive some while her character gets a grasp of her past and present. Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous are funny but limited in exposure on screen. Luke Evans poses as quite a formidable villain, but we do not get to see much of his ruthless aggression since most of it is manifested in the manner of tanks and flip cars that create the destruction. Oh and please bring Gal Gadot back.... please.With some crazy car chases in London and physics defying sequences in Spain and the airstrip, Fast & Furious 6 packs quite a few horses to satiate the enthusiast. The plot is typical and is played out in banal fashion with occasionally cheeky dialogues. But that's not the point of this franchise. It's the super-cars, women, action and hip hop music that the protagonists roll out to in the drag race arena that will bring you back for more.... Speaking of which, there's a nice cliff-hanger to F&F 7 after the end so remain seated with the belts still on.7.853 on a scale of 1-10.",kunalkhandwala,6/1/13,2013
100,6,"It is what it is - 5,9/10","Fast & Furious 6, what can I say? I mean, my expectations were really low and boy were they met. I'm not saying the type of low like ""This is going to be bad"", more like ""Hmm, I might give this a shot"". The director Justin Lin doesn't try to do anything else other than sticking to the trashy film that it is, and I would give him and the movie credit for that. But more? Nope, I think people are giving it too much credit for that. Sure, there were some ""good"" trashy action set-pieces in there, some muscle(cars), a tank, big guns, and... Nothing more. Maybe Vin Diesel flying across a very big gap between two bridges to save Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and landing on a car breaking the laws of physics - why? Because ""She is family, and family stick together, you don't turn your back on them even if they do"", or something. One thing maybe worth mentioning are the physical performances by everyone in the movie, especially the ladies.Everything ""good"" that was in the movie was already in the trailer, so what I ended up doing was just waiting for the scenes to pass by. There was a sequence in it where they had to drive after an airplane, and then they actually brought it down with some hooks and whatnot. That sequence goes on for about 15 minutes, which means that the runway must've been very, very long. And of course after that sequence they get to the end of the runway. A lot of innocent people also died in the scene with the tank (where it just runs over random cars with unimportant people in them).A lot of people did laugh, and they laughed a lot. The only thing that made me chuckle was probably The Rock himself just him being there. The only time I actually laughed was when the title ""Furious 6"" (If you have seen the movie you'll know which one I mean) came up because some guy in the back shouted ""6 Furious"". And I am not joking when I tell you that it was the only time during the movie that I actually laughed.This movie left me very uninterested and bored because of the plot, story, badly written characters and the dumb dialogues. I couldn't enjoy the big action set-pieces because I was so bored. So in general, this is a boring movie in every kind of way. And the fact that people in the audience gave a it big round of applause after the movie ended just made me wanna stick my head in the sand.",yaldish,5/24/13,2013
101,7,Faster Than the rest of the franchise !!!,"This movie was so great maybe the best between the franchise the energy creativity in this movie was not found in the others i enjoyed every single second in the movie,beside for a movie who has explosive and fast cars with fight scenes it had a decent plotbut i won't say anything cause there is some TWIST in the plot i laughed so hard in this movie i would say almost half of the movie was comedynow for the post ending after credits it will grin your ears and make you curious about fast 7 the film deals with criminals world class with great mayhem by their carsIf you are interested by cars and explosive things and comedy with an amount of drama and love plus fight scenes with awesome mayhem F&F 6 is what you are looking forP.S:sorry for my English it's my second language",Tripmoh,7/8/13,2013
102,6,"Same old, same old","When watching Fast and Furious movies you have to be ready to accept that you're going to see some pretty unbelievable (impossible) stunts but FF6 takes it to a new level.

Two scenes stick out for me. The first when they are chasing the tank and Dom jumps from his moving car, over a huge drop, catches Lettie and lands on another car without a scratch - pretty stupid. The other is the final scene where the cars are some how keeping up with a huge military plane that is taking off and the run-way goes on for about 30 miles - ridiculous.

Apart from this its the same old stuff, not really a boring moment, action packed and entertaining. Shame its gone away from the cars and the racing which is why I loved the FF franchise in the first place. No decent cars in this one and there are no F1 cars in the film, as someone said there was in their review.

Think they will have finally milked all they can from the 7th and apparently last film.",lewisboreham,5/28/13,2013
103,9,Fantastic movie from an almost died-out franchise,"We've all seen our favorite movies churn out those forgettable and often straight-to-video sequels; Death Race, Wrong Turn, Resident Evil. (Really, not Resident Evil???). And with The Fast and the Furious series, you were starting to see the decline after 2 and most definitely 3. So for Justin Lin to bring back this series from the dead, even to use the weird sequels as a part of the story in his new trilogy, is incredibly impressive.As for Furious Six, I thought it was incredibly enjoyable. Few movies are actually this fun to watch. The action felt very well paced, never dragging on or repetitious in any way. The dialogue was humorous and the story was very interesting to see played out.I feel like the only movie I could compare this to is Transformers 3. Coming from a series that I felt like was convoluted and ""missing the point"" of a fun action film, Transformers 3 and Furious Six alike really meet what they were striving for. An incredibly fun film.This next part is mainly for people who have seen the movie already, though not a spoiler.I've seen a few reviews that say that last action packed scene in the film's climax was too much and could have been cut. I could not disagree more. I feel like the filmmaker mislead everyone to think everything was fine and dandy, all wrapped up, but I could not help but feel that the action was over too abruptly, and I still needed to see more. And then there is that last, incredibly epic action scene. The filmmakers made me feel like I needed to see more, so that they could deliver that last scene specifically for me. Great filmmaking, great film. Very impressed.",Ginnysababe,6/9/13,2013
104,7,Lots of action but too much punching and kicking,This is a grand and extravagant looking production. The exotic locations are good. The car vs car action is what you'd expect and doesn't disappoint. Things go even further with tanks and planes. The car race in London was a bit artificially sped up. Who knew tanks could drive so fast. The attempts at humor are weak and mostly unfunny. But who care if some things are unreal thats part of the charm.Sadly the cast has aged. Paul is looking older = needs to stay out of the sun. Vin looks a little flabby. The Rock looked a bit too pumped up. Doesn't he know steroids are out now. The long drawn out obsession with Michelle Rodriguez's character is a bit tiresome. Jordanna is looking a bit gaunt. Luke Evans as the villain is a bit forgettable.Can there be too much action in a movie like this? In a way yes. The punching and fighting has come to equal the vehicular action. Enough of the fighting and punching back and forth! I know they had to use Gina Carano's skills but it felt like overkill. You can see that in any other action movie. Felt like a Hong Kong action flick.Overall things are quite grand and large scale especially looking back to the earlier ones in the series. Worth a watch.,phd_travel,5/30/13,2013
105,10,Fast & Furious 6,"What an amazing movie! I can't believe the next movie will have Jason Statham in it, and as a bad guy, nonetheless. There has been a rumor going around, that I would like to put to rest! People have been saying in Fast 7, one of the main protagonists, Brian or Dom, is going to die! This is untrue, although a good contributing character will be killed. Oh No!!! But this is one of the most amazingly spectacular movie series of all time, but that is just an opinion of a great fan! For whoever reads this review, I am sorry for the spoiler, but please enjoy the next movie!!! I hope that in the next movie, another new character will be added to the series, which I am sure will happen. Thanks to the knowing of the coming of Ian Shaw!!",koolerkid1357,7/15/13,2013
106,7,"It did not let the franchise down, Fun, action, speed...","First of all, to all the critics. The director never claimed he was making an intelligent, thought provoking movie, he promised an action packed movie made with cars. If you want a thought provoking, artistic film, go see Stoker or Gatsby. Now to my review.

The film still centres around the main characters from the last film with a welcome addition of Luke Evans (Jason Shaw) and the return of Michelle Rodriguez (Lettie)and surprisingly Gina Carano (Riley).

The bad thing about the film was its blatant attempt to insult the intelligence of viewers with its obvious disregard for reality, I mean how long was that runway? What kind of FBI powers allow you to stab two people in solitary and get out of the US and back to Spain without attracting attention? These holes are evident all over the plot. This was not the case with the other films in the franchise. The film was loaded with every stereotype available from the silly English westend salesman to the ""all Black people love bling"" story. This was a poor attempt at humor, my guess is, this was targeted at the growing British underclass as the film setting was London. I am sure US viewers would find it simply old fashioned and distasteful.

The good things pretty much allow you to ignore the bad. The performances from Luke Evans (Zeus in the Immortals) was amazing and convincing, a real baddie, something the franchise hasn't really had. The action scenes were truly explosive, great car chases and quality fight scenes, Justin Lin clearly paid more attention to these than to any other aspect of the film. There was definitely less skin on show so it was a welcome change for the older crowd who are not raging with hormones.

If you want to see an action flick that keeps you on the edge of your seat with an almost predictable ending, then you won't be disappointed. The franchise is set already for the sequel in 2014 with Jason Statham, my guess, it will go down hill from there, this is the point when decreasing returns to scale kicks in. All in all a great watch and for �9.50, it will be dollars well spent.",emeraldorc,6/9/13,2013
107,10,Brilliant,"You might think this series of films would get dull by now,no way,it's still brilliant over the top action. The main crux of this one is this is Dominic finds out Letty is still alive and working for a bunch of crimials. So Dominic teams up with the police to find her,he does so and she... Well i won't tell you,but it's all brilliantly played out,leaving the viewer wondering just what is going on in Letty's mind. So another fast and furious and the end leaves you with no doubt they'll be yet another. the fast and furious series just keeps getting better and better so far fast and furious six has to be the best film in the series.",drewconnor,12/4/13,2013
108,7,Every sequel has been a little better than the last!,"'FAST & FURIOUS 6': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The sixth installment in the ever-popular action movie franchise brings back all the stars from the previous films including Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Paul Walker, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Sung Kang, Jordana Brewster, Gal Gadot and even Michelle Rodriguez (who's character was killed off two films ago). MMA champion (and rising female action star) Gina Carano (of 'HAYWIRE' fame) and Luke Evans also join the cast this time around. Justin Lin (who directed the last three sequels as well) returns as director and Chris Morgan (who wrote the last three installments) returns as the film's writer. This chapter has DSS agent Luke Hobbs tracking down Dominic Toretto and his team to enlist the gang's help in bringing down a team of deadly mercenary drivers. Toretto reluctantly agrees to help Hobbs when he discovers his old love, he thought was dead, is still alive and working with the team of mercenaries. The film is of course bigger and more action packed than ever and delivers everything die-hard fans of the series have come to expect.The movie begins with Dom (Diesel), Brian (Walker) and the rest of the car racing crew living around the world, on the lam, while spending the $100 million loot they scored in their Rio heist (at the end of the last film). Hobbs (Johnson), now working with his new partner Riley (Carano), tracks down Dom and convinces him to help him capture a team of mercenary drivers led by an ex-British Special Forces soldier named Owen Shaw (Evans). Hobbs offers Dom and his team full pardons if they help him stop Shaw but it's the info that Dom's ex-love Letty (Rodriguez) is still alive that persuades him into doing the job. Action and carnage ensue.I was never a huge fan of the original 2001 hit but I've liked each sequel a little more ever since (although I still haven't seen 'TOKYO DRIFT'). I think the franchise got a lot better with the last chapter when it added 'The Rock' into the mix. That's when box office for the series really skyrocketed and it also reached it's critical acclaim peak; how many movie series can one say that about (I can't think of any). It's great that this film added Carano as well and they also add another big action star at the end, in a post-credits scene, that should build even more anticipation for the next film in the series (which is already planned for next year). The franchise is still just a series of brainless action scenes strung together with no real plot or involving character development but they do keep getting more and more spectacular. This film does have some amazing car chases once again (including one involving a tank) but it still couldn't top the best car chase of the year (or just about any year) from another long running action movie franchise: 'A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD'.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge23zs5RPrM",Hellmant,5/29/13,2013
109,1,7 out of 10?! What is wrong with you people?,"If you're about to watch this movie because of its 7 points, DON'T!

Here's the thing: Every movie has its universe. It could be a fantasy world as in Lords of the Ring, an alternative world as in super hero movies like Marvel Universe or a possible future world for sci-fi movies etc. If you're seeing such a movie you will be told the rules of that particular universe at the very beginning and you don't say ""Hey! This is ridiculous, how does he walking on the walls? A spider bite doesn't do that?!"" Because if you're watching a film like that you're gonna need to build your logic around its own rules. THAT'S OK.

But with this film... I don't know what to say! OK I knew that it was going to include some impossible action moves and I knew there will be a lot of lame talks of shitty characters but street race in the middle of London and not getting caught? OK, OK that can be as well, after all this movie is all about that. And then the bad guy and Vin Diesel face each other on the street and instead if trying to shoot each other they make cool talk? Like in the Heat, like De Niro and Pacino? Hahaha yeah, right! But you know what? That's OK as well! All the failing script writing and the boring plot is OK too! But street racing bad guys attacking a military base?? Arggghh gimme a break! That was it for me, I dropped it right there. Don't waste your time people, if you're not after some real crappy movie.",kozansahin,9/18/13,2013
110,7,vertigo thrilling stronger sequel,"pretty good movie that would force you to sit straight and upright through the whole nine yards when it played on. yes, rarely a title possessed franchise could be this good, there were TV episode-like movies like 007 or mission impossible, but some of them just felt weak, either affected by weak screenplays, bad directors or newly replaced main characters, but fast and furious seems to not only be able to maintain the quality of each one, it is actually getting better and better. the last Brazilian heist was a rarely accomplishment with bolder and crazier scenario but turned out to be very thrilling. if you think dragging and pulling a huge bank vault around citywide in a firefight is crazy, watch this new one, tank, cargo plan, fast cars....you might need to take some tranquilizers to calm down your nerves and resettle your blood pressure after you back home from the theater. and again, you'll see some highly unlikely scenes in this movie like any other fast and furious movies: after digged a Russian made high power military standard bullet out of his right front should-chest area, the guy never needed to recuperated and didn't need any blood infusion, just wrapped up and beating his opponents like nothing happened. an at least over several tons super tank could drive as fast as all the fast cars and crashed them like eggs. the high speed of the tank on the freeway was some scene that i simply could not believe at all. then the firefight on the runway inside a cargo plane. well, since it carried out so over-the-top crazy, i have nothing to say no more. this is indeed a crazy movie but nobody won't dislike it.",rightwingisevil,5/19/13,2013
113,6,Auto fans will be disappointed,"I'm a huge fan of the F&F franchise, but this movie has taken the series 180 degrees in the wrong direction. The film is a great movie-going experience and worth every cent of the ticket price for a good time....but hardcore fans and auto enthusiasts like myself are going to be really disappointed with the film.

The production team spent a lot of time assembling some spectacular cars and used them very little. The current-gen Nissan GT-R is only seen for the first forty seconds or so of the movie. The cool, custom built ""flip cars"" are only used for one of the heist scenes despite being an important plot line for the film. But the major disappointment is the Mk1 Euro Escort, which we see glimpses of many times in the film, which only appears for about three or four minutes in a driving sequence, despite being one of the leading ""cars"" featured in the ads. And there is absolutely no explanation or feasible plot as to why Letty is driving around and smashing stuff up in an extremely rare, hand-manufactured, limited production Jensen Interceptor (which is really cool, but why does she have it?)

Advertising branding was a big turn-off as well - Paul Walker is seen wearing Carhartt shirts during half the movie, and both Snap-On Tools and Dodge must have paid big bucks to have their products front and center in so many of the scenes. It was distracting - what happened to the young crew of tuners from California who defined the car culture and lifestyle??? I like the new direction that the franchise is taking, but seriously...none of these guys would have been seen buying & racing Spykers, Paganis, and Lambos when they were busy talking trash on Ferraris and building Supras in the first film. I think the franchise has lost its way.",rothj06,6/2/13,2013

117,7,The Best Fast & Furious Yet!,"Never have been a fan of this series, but after seeing the trailers and hearing some positive things, I decided to give this one a shot. And ya know what? I actually had a pretty fun time. I like the direction Justin Lin took with this one just making it big and stupid, but totally self-aware of what it is. The action set-pieces are an absolute blast to watch with each one topping the previous one before it. The last 2 scenes are worth the price of admission alone. I also enjoyed the chemistry between all the actors which added a surprising amount of laughs to the film. Still, the film has plenty of flaws that the series has shared. There is a bit too much down time in the middle where the film starts to drag when it begins to build on it's incredibly thin story. There's also some moments of dialogue that are so poorly written it's hard not to notice them. Overall, while it's not great by any means, I would defiantly say that this is my favorite of the series so far (although that's not saying much). Nothing special or all that memorable, but as a summer popcorn flick, it gets the job done. Fans of the series will most likely love it while even the non-fans will still be able to have some fun with it. I do have to admit though after the post-credit scene, I would be lying if I said I wasn't incredibly excited for the 7th installment!",Rebel_With_A_Cause_94,6/1/13,2013

120,1,Did a monkey get access to a typewriter again?,"Does any writer actually know what Interpol does? Really? None of them seem to. Most blockbuster hacks like the dribbling baboon that wrote this garbage seem to think it is literally the ""international police"", but all it takes is a 10 second search and a quick squiz of the wikipedia article to find out Interpol is a bunch of deskbound intelligence analysts and little more - certainly not the gun-tooting American clich�s that are depicted in this film.

As a budding writer it astonishes me that stuff like this gets made. There are no literary devices. There is no character arc. No exposition. No personality. It is nothing more than a stunt reel of car chases (some of which, to my frustration, used CGI, the use of which spoils any real tension). There is not a brain cell in its entire two hour body.

Not a single shot to inspire or charm. Not a single moment of inspiration. There is nothing here. It is like ordering a hamburger and getting two slices of bread - where is the meat, and all the things that enhance its flavour? Who are these people on screen I am meant to care about? Why should I care? The movie never even tries to reel you in. It just tosses the net into the sea and hopes to get a catch.

Lack of ideas/authenticity/effort to one side, the story is nothing but a slap in the face to any intelligent adult. What do you do when you have an international crisis on your hands? Do you comb through government employees for savvy specialists, investigators and special forces operatives? Do you source police experts, seasoned FBI detectives and forensic criminalists?

OF COURSE NOT. IDIOT. You recruit a retired bunch of untrained, utterly unqualified, convicted car thieves and thugs to hunt down an international fugitive, because that is the most logical course of action. Makes complete sense.

Then again, in this world every country except America is completely inept at catching crooks and couldn't handcuff a bag snatcher unless Vin Diesel and the Rock were pinning him down.

Oh, and there's British crooks with easy access to automatic firearms in downtown London cooking off rounds like it's going out of fashion. And somehow a bunch of convicted criminals are allowed to carry guns in London without any training/qualifications and nobody bats an eyelid. Very authentic.

Makes Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters look like Gone with the Wind by comparison.",mwburrows,6/17/13,2013
124,6,Fast & Furious 6,"The titles are getting less inspirational now as we lurch into the sixth entry in this massively overblown franchise. We've had LA California Miami Tokyo Dominican Republic Mexico/US border and Rio de Janeiro, now its London's turn for more turbo charged high jinx. More like a video game as we travel around the globe to different destinations for the car sequences (take your pick). Oh and this is still a prequel to the third film as Han is still alive and well, all the films are a prequel to the third accept for the next (number 7), as I've discovered.

So this time there is another bad guy that must be stopped gee whizz! a British villain, the Yanks just love us caddish Brits. The little twist this time is the fact that Toretto and his crew are no longer the ones on the run, they are hired by G.I.Rock.babyoil.biceps.Johnson to bring this bad guy to justice. The reason is because he's building some kind of special tech that can bring down all power for an entire region, and then he will sell it...fiendish!

The start of this film is basically a Bond sequence...seeing as this is what the film has now become, a kind of 'Bond/Mission: Impossible/(recent) Die Hard' mix with the good humoured character teamwork of 'Ocean's Eleven'. The uniting of the team is very much in this style, a little montage of the gang in their various hideouts, then all called up for service by the leader, criminals assemble!

Mr Johnson is so hokey here too, of course he's not meant to be anything else really but Jesus! The guy is getting so thick he can't walk right, either that or he just swaggers horrendously. The dude is like a tagline machine, spitting out one butch statement after another, he's a walking action figure.

So virtually everybody is dragged back into the frey both goodies and baddies, the casting continuity is actually impressive. I think we all know now that Rodriguez is the big surprise reentry here as it turns out she wasn't killed in number four. Nope she has been brought back to allow the franchise to continue even further. In all complete and utter honesty most of this film is totally mundane and routine, there is nothing here that is fresh or exciting. We are shown what really happened to Letty although I can't believe she simply wasn't just shot in the head to make sure. Carano gets a good fight sequence...naturally, the underground is shown along with some other landmarks...naturally, and of course we are given one obligatory street race.

London and no traffic?? nah! but wait! what was that moment when O'Connor knocks that bug device off the front of his BMW by skidding past a concrete pillar? How the hell did he even know where it was? its size? width? how on earth did he manage to gauge that move without slamming into the pillar or just missing the bug completely?? I know these films are not to be taken seriously but its moments like that that just make it laughable, a joke.

The cars this time are more unique with a few more British models (of course), bored with large numbers of imports we now get some curious models. The Dodge Charger Daytona and its long pointed body with huge spoiler fin, a British Ford Escort, the Jenson Interceptor, a Ford Anvil Mustang, a Plymouth Barracuda and an Alfa Romeo are all used.

The film grows tiresome right up until a fast paced chase sequence in Spain down a highway. Starting off kinda generic but quickly turning into something much more interesting as they end up chasing a tank. The sequence unfortunately ends on a highly absurd set piece requiring CGI assistance which spoils the moment but it is fun (how many innocent people were killed on that highway?!!). Just when you think that's that bugger me we get another good sequence, saved the best stuff for last it seems. This time the team are chasing (always chasing) a large cargo aircraft which is stuffed with yet more cars. So guess what? yep we get lots of cars everywhere...silly stunts, CGI stunts explosions...utterly impossible feats, Dwayne 'my t- shirts are really tight' Johnson fighting an even bigger meathead, more girl fights, heroic deaths and the longest damn take off in the world. Seriously how long does it take that plane to lift? and how long is that runway??

At first I was really not going along with this whole idea, a sixth film! Then as I started to watch I realised hey I was right! this is just complete rehash. Its only when we get to the last half hour or so of the film that things get exciting with those two chase sequences, up to then its seriously average. I like how they have engineered the plot from part three and the franchise as a whole into a bigger picture, all these films are prequels and the finale here does tie that up nicely. The only thing is before that they do tie up the whole franchise very nicely with a good ending for all the characters involved. I did get the feeling this was the perfect moment to finish this for good, end it now with a solid bookend. The fact they are pushing it further is really milking it and really pushing their luck...if you ask me.

This was gonna be a low score but the last two sequences in the finale saved this films life big time, almost a fail, how much longer can it hold out?

Hobbs (Johnson) has a case that deals with Letty (Rodriguez) who is suppose to be dead and the love of Dominic Toretto (Diesel). Hobbs goal is to track down Letty's leader, Owen Shaw (Evans), who has a device that can cause widespread destruction. Toretto's goal is to find Letty and bring her back home to her family that includes: Brian O'Conner (Walker), Roman (Gibson), Han (Kang), Gisele (Godot), and Tej (Bridges). There are a lot of action and comedic moments that make the movie very entertaining. There are many fight scenes that are unrealistic and hard to believe events could actually happen. Overall Fast and Furious 6 is a very entertaining movie that held your attention throughout the entire movie.",bigeflockhart51,5/29/13,2013
128,7,One of the best F&F with good story,"Summery : This is one of the best movie in series.It was all about cars. This time, it is not just cars, it's more on speed with less cars. Story is nice to make you seat. Movie is quite fast with some mix action. Some fight scenes made realistic but some are not. Anyway, at few things you think about how could they do it ? But they are doing it.All the cast and crew have worked great. Action sequences are awesome, breathtaking. Plot is good & keeps you with it.Why watch: This movie is not about cars as I said before. It has a story. Really good actionWhy not: It's an entertainment with hardly at few places you think it's not possible or why they ?

130,6,The Vidiot Reviews,"Fast & Furious 6The best way to curb street racing in your community is to generate constant gridlock.Mind you, the racers in this action movie are inclined to go off-road.Dominic (Vin Diesel) comes out of hiding to help DSS agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) stop a rogue solider (Luke Evans) from selling an EMP on the black market.In exchange, he and his crew (Paul Walker, Gal Gadot, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Tyrese Gibson, Chris Bridges) want amnesty for their US crimes and the freedom to return home.The fifth sequel in the series, Fast 6 doesn't dazzle like its predecessor Fast 5 but it does maintain the franchise's new espionage angle.And while street racing takes a back seat in this one, there are enough overblown car- chases, unexpected cameos and sudsy melodrama to propel the series onward.But, as always, this series ignores the real victims of street racing: ran-over flag-girls.

131,4,Last third of the movie went from bad to worse.,"As a motorsports fan, the fast and furious franchise has always been on my watch list. The cars, the intense actions always kept me at the edge of my seat. There were only 2 out of the previous 5 that I did not like which was 2 Fast 2 Furious and Tokyo Drift. Why? 2 Fast 2 Furious was plain, boring and too predictable of a story line. Tokyo drift wasn't too bad but I did not like the sudden absents of characters as I loved the casting in the first movie. The 4th installment got better and the 5th installment was even better which is very rare to find in such franchise movies. Hence, I went to the cinema the day it was released. By the end of the movie, I was cringing and ultimately disappointed with so many of the scenes that they did. As a motorsports fan, you tend to know what is possible and what isn't with cars, and you know specification of car models and their abilities, but with Fast and Furious you tend to let it slide because, well, it is after all a movie.

The starting of the movie, was good. I got more eager to watch what happens next. The bad parts of the movie started with a tank convoy. In the beginning Shaw and his team heist a military convoy so dramatically and when it came to protecting a piece of chip worth billions after knowing that Shaw was after it, the convoy was a simple 2 jeeps and a truck containing a military tank with the chip inside. Shaw then effortlessly manages to get into the tank and drive it out of the truck.. which was still to me, acceptable. Then, Dom saves Letty by performing a physically impossible stunt by jumping over the highway and landing on a car to break their very dramatic fall. That was the start of many crap scenes to come. It then got worse to the point where I almost left the cinema.

The ending scene is always the climax and and the most action. In this one, it involved a Russian cargo plane with a few cars that manage to keep up with the plane that landed and was going to take off again on what seemed like an endless runway...

It was as if a 10 year old boy directed the last third of the movie and it was horrible. I wonder if this could be the end of a good long streak of the franchise.",nicperreau1710,5/26/13,2013
132,6,Good Fun,"Fast & Furious 6 is a perfectly enjoyable film with some laughs and spectacular action set pieces. Despite being completely ridiculous in some spots, especially the long climax scene. But in spite of this, the film is satisfyingly entertaining and at times thrilling. The performances from all of the cast are good , if a little hammy in places. Some of the banter between Chris Bridge's and Tyrese Gibson's characters gave the film some comic moments. Fast 6 doesn't live long in the memory but it's good fun while it lasts , despite being a tiny bit too long.Overall this is a solid entry into the fast & Furious franchise that will keep you entertained throughout.6/10",ginga145,6/14/13,2013
133,6,Bring back the nostalgia,"The original F&F1 sparked the import scene in North America, with at the time seemingly accurate depictions of street cars and performance modifications. The movie was a car film in and out and as another user stated each movie has been getting progressively worse, this evident with the sixth instalment of the fast and the furious.Fast and the furious movies need Performance import cars that the common man can relate too, anything else could be lacking and the film would be just as nostalgic as the first movie. It really is sad to see where it came from and where it is now, I will not be watching the seventh if that so happens and I advise everyone from doing the same. Unless you couldn't give two flux about cars then watch it for Vin diesels boobs and a bullshit storyline.Bring back the nostalgia and RIP Paul Walker.",loganbentley,12/10/13,2013
134,6,Not as good as the previous...,"When I saw the ""Fast Five"" movie I thought and expected that ""Furious 6"" was going to be a better movie than that, but it was not. And that's because this movie far surpassed some ordinary things that in all of ""The Fast and the Furious"" movies happened and I mean things with cars and not only.I have to say that in this movie seemed bad (not say ugly) not all but some of it the visual effects which were used on it. I like visual effects but when they used in moderation and not in a hole movie.Finally I want to tell you that in ""Fast Five"" I liked the interpretations of Paul Walker (Brian O'Conner), Dwayne Johnson (Hobbs) and Sung Kang (Han).",Thanos_Alfie,11/19/13,2013

It starts out with Dom and O'Connor in there retreat in Spain when Hobbs come to ask Dom for help in bringing down a bunch of highly coordinated street races cum thieves. He also shows Dom a recent photo of Letty so that he just cant turn down the offer. From the streets of London to an army base in Spain.

The movie has its fair shares of twists and turns and the car chases and chick fights really keeps you glued to your seats.The post warning and before the credits roll out,the cut scene has a delightful surprise.

141,3,Idle 'Furious' needs a tuneup,"Although critics seem to be following all over themselves about this film, the sixth installment in the ""Fast and the Furious"" series plays like an engine stuck on idle. It goes nowhere and leaves the viewer with nothing but mind-numbing FX and CGI that makes little or no sense and gives new meaning to the term ""implausible."" Blame it on director Justin Lin, though, as he cannot seem to decide if he wants to continue the ""Fast & Furious"" lowbrow modus operandi or create a Rent-A-Center James Bond flick.

Ultimately, however, it all ends up as a demolition derby where classic automobiles are smashed and destroyed under the weight of tanks and aircraft as well as a stilted, pretentious script. And, to add to the confusion, it's not even titled ""Fast & Furious 6,"" but just ""Furious 6,"" which is certainly an apt description of the emotion one feels after shelling out their hard-earned bucks to view this tripe.

With a cast headed by Vin Diesel and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson (appearing in his 50th film so far this year), along with hangers-on Paul Walker (whose career peaked at ""8 Below""), Tyrese Gibson, Chris ""Ludicrous"" Bridges, Michelle Rodriquez, Jordana Brewster and Luke Evans, among others, the acting is as ridiculous as the implausible (there's that word again) stunts which punctuate this effort every time the inane dialogue screeches it to a halt.

Alas, those stunts and car chases (and wrecks) which trademark the franchise, are so over-the-top stupefying and obviously fake - and the automobiles (which few of our readers as well as the author could never afford in two lifetimes) are smashed for no reason, whatsoever.

Not that the plot itself (the original F&F gang is reassembled by Federal Agent Hobbs - Johnson, fresh off his appearance in ""Pain & Gain"" - to stop British military traitor Owen Shaw, played by Evans, ""The Raven,"" from selling secrets to the highest bidder) is strong enough to draw anyone into the theater, either.

The cast seems to sleepwalk through the production with only the occasional chase or explosion or plane crash to jar the audience out of its stupor. And speaking of airplanes, the concluding sequence - which features a Russian cargo jet lumbering for takeoff with cars and the entire cast either hanging from it or chasing it - goes on so long the runway has to be at least 50 miles long.

Instead of concentrating on the action on screen or the razor-thin story, all I kept wondering was just where they found a runway that long in the first place.

That was the only defense mechanism I had during this nonsense, just think of something else and get it over with. And pay no heed to the critics who write that the movie does what its supposed to do and that's why many of them recommend it.

A dog answering the call of nature on the side of the road does what's supposed to do, too, but that doesn't mean I want to watch that on the big screen.",gregeichelberger,5/26/13,2013
145,9,Ridiculously entertaining!,"I love this movie! Furious 6 is even bigger and more over-the-top than Fast Five, which I also loved! That vault-dragging scene was a blast but this new sequel is even more epic and maddeningly entertaining! This time, Hobbs and new sidekick Riley, played by Gina Carano, team with Dom, Brian, Han, Gisele, Roman, and Tej to take down Owen Shaw and his crew. If they succeed, Dom and Co. receive full pardons and the chance to make their family whole again as Letty is in fact alive and working with Owen Shaw.

This movie opens with a race along winding roads that ends at a hospital. Mia is giving birth and Brian's a mess. This movie is all about family and I definitely appreciate that though I think they said the word ""family"" about.... 1,675,894,035 times! I kid- The attention to continuity is admirable with an opening titles sequence highlighting super sweet moments from the previous five entries. There are a couple surprise character appearances that should make fans smile at least a little.

The Rock is still huge and awesome, always great to see Vin and Paul doing their thing (Paul does a better job here), and welcome back Tyrese, Ludicrous, Sung, and Gal! Michelle's Letty still has attitude, is tough, yet vulnerable. Seeing Letty and Dom together again just feels so right. Sorry, Elena! Gina isn't that great of an actress but she sure kicks butt! Luke Evans as the main villain does a swell job! Best villain so far! His flip car is wild! Though his death wasn't that epic...Speaking of deaths, one of the good guys doesn't make it to the end, my heart AHHH! Poor Han...

Furious 6 offers up a few twists, a ton of comedy (thanks mostly to Tyrese and Ludicrous), over-the-top car and tank and plane action, hand-to-hand combat (Jah vs. Roman and Han, Riley vs. Letty, The Rock/Dom vs. Klaus), shootouts, a wonderfully directed race between Dom and Letty, so much entertainment! You can tell that these guys and gals are having a blast and know just how ridiculous and fun this series is! I love how these characters end up back at the house from the first film!

If you're into crazy car stunts, fist fights, shootouts, beautiful women, hilarious one-liners, cheesy acting, melodrama, fun, then this movie is for you!

148,6,"Good, not great","This will contain some spoilers.I thought this was a good movie but not great. I definitely liked Fast Five MUCH better. I thought this movie was VERY HIGHLY predictable. I had Hobbs' new partner tagged as a traitor from the second she came on screen, that one was WAY too easy to see. Also, the second that Dom and Brian left Mia alone with the baby, it was obvious that Shaw was going after her to use as a hostage (that was easy to see as well). I thought it was also easy to see that one of the team was going to die, although I did have Han pegged as the obvious choice, I didn't see Han AND Gisele both dying. I liked the action and the stunts, even if they were sometimes ridiculous (it IS a Fast & Furious movie, the stunts are always going to be ridiculous). I had a problem with the predictability of the script. Entertaining ...... Yes. Best of the series ....... No. Best of series is definitely Fast five. One last thing...... Leo and Santo were VERY VERY missed in this movie",ryan_dme3,6/10/13,2013
149,8,Well Packed Action-Comedy-Consistency,"Nice opening title by the way...

FF6 have everything that a summer movie should. Fast packed action, interlude comedy that makes us laugh, consistency, steady acting, and not that many plot holes that could ruin the movie.

First of all, after the movie started (about 10 minutes), my mind kept thinking about this movie should have a sequel. The action scenes of FF6 have a nice varieties and also an excellent climax graphic, cause its going up all the way along with the movie plot (seriously, i think the tank scene is great and after that it could be an anticlimax, but i was wrong because the plane scene is absolutely amazing). And of course besides the car showdown, there was this nice fighting scene all over the place.

For the comedy side, This movie have quite a nice jokes that serve their purpose (as an intermission between action scene), and classy one too. Take example at the skyline-charger joke, that's my favorite one (since FF1). Also, Roman Pierce's stupidity, and few other jokes that go well for the tone of the movie.

What makes FF6 even greater is the consistency factor, and not just to the scenes of this movie, but also to the prequel ones. Fast & Furious 6 shows that all of 5 movies before this one matters (yes, including FF Tokyo Drift). They don't dump away people and proves that they still exist in this saga's timeline (like Elena, and even Braga).

Plot holes... yea, this movie has some. A little this and a little that, but in my opinion, it doesn't matter. What did you expect should be a blowing mindless (sort of) action movie, and you got that while watching this movie. Sure it gets kinda boring in the middle, but i assure you that it'll all paid off once you get to the peak of this movie.

To sum up, Fast & Furious 6 proves me something. After i watched Fast5 (where the post credit scene shows the picture of letty) and there's a rumor that there'll be a sequel after this, part of me cannot help to thinking skeptical. How the hell are they gonna make a movie that gonna top this one (action-wise), and they just did. So, applause for this movie cause it makes me happy... 8 of 10.

154,7,Silly but fun movie,"I had a great evening watching Furious, I'm not really into street racing - but this film is more about the fighting and the bravado - and faux 'coolness'. The Rock seems to have somehow bulked up EVEN MORE for this role (it didn't look healthy - but I couldn't stop staring at his arms!) and his screen presence made Vin Diesel look like an ant, but Dwayne was fun to watch - if a little overly serious for such a silly film.

Anyway, the runway scene has been discussed at length already - how about the bit when a car on one carriageway attached to a tank on the other side by a wire manages to pass by several concrete pillars without knocking them over (the wire actually passed through the pillars???) is totally impossible physics but you forgive it cos it's an ACTION film.

I'm not a huge F&F fan because I have a modicum of common sense, so probably why I'm not upset that they didn't try to make another Tokyo Drift and tried something different in this film.

Gotta say by far my favourite bit was where for some unknown but brilliant reason the director had Vin and Rock have a conversation at the end where they stand at different distances from the camera and both appear to grow and shrink as the angle changes. You'll know when you watch it what bit I'm talking about - right after one of the 'crew' comments that Vin's two wives are ""sexy as hell"" (or was that ""sexy as a hill""?).

Honestly - we watched that bit a second time over and laughed up some beer. It's hilarious! More of that in F7, PLEASE...!

The ending is awful, considering all the squished Spanish people and mourning families of innocent military henchmen Vin and Dwayne et.al leave in their wake.

I hope next time, F & F will feature some more scenes. Some more cool races and actions. We would love to see more of these. The thrill did not get out of ourselves even after we finished watching this one. Actors are really into the action. You can feel that they love the movie so much as if it were real to them.

Flaws i Observed : *How can team ignore when a Tank Crush a Lot of Vehicles on the Road? Don't they Concern about the people in them? *How Can a Crushed Car with Ordinary Rope Can Dislocate the Tanker? *The Way Vin Diesel caught Michelle Rodriguez looks Unrealistic. *How can three normal Cars Control the High Speed Rotors of a Plane? *How can hero escape with his car from front part of plane while it blows off?

157,8,The 'Fast & Furious' franchise getting better and better,"I think it's getting better and better after 'Fast Five', since the introduction of Dwayne Johnson into the franchise. After stylish 'Tokyo Drift' I loved very much this and one before it from the series. There were not many movie series that pulled the franchise from average to awesome like this one did so the credit goes to the writers and director as well as the actors.As expected finally the action babe arrived, Gina Carano. After seeing her in 'Haywire' I thought she would be next Lara Croft. I mean the next big action lady, the one after Angelina Jolie but not as I expected role though okay. There was a death of one of a main character in the movie, I kinda doubt that because of surprise re-entry of Michelle Rodriguez into the series.It was a well written script, engaging characters except one scene where Dwayne Johnson and another actor who make a British man go stripped. The movie missed having some nice action sequences from the Dwayne Johnson a little let down from that perspective. But the rest of the stunts were breathtaking. Who cares whether it is graphic are real I just enjoyed especially the final one with the aircraft which long lasts for over 20 minutes. I guess there won't be that long runway anywhere in the world :p. The movie will be more enjoyable by hardcore action movie fans so why don't you try if you have not seen yet.7.5/10",Reno-Rangan,11/16/13,2013
158,7,Never a bad thing when a franchise can get better and better every movie.,"Wow. Fast 6. Six! And there's gonna be a seventh one too! The fast and furious franchise has never been a real favorite of mine. Since I'm in 8th grade however, I do enjoy a good turn- your-brain-off film that is oozing male testosterone from every corner, whether it's big guns, explosions, hot chicks, or body builders crashing into each other with cars. Despite all this, I've never really been a fan of the franchise until it's 5th release. Directed by Justin Lin, it was the first well shot, well paced flick of the franchise. Although it was dumb, I had a ton of fun with it. So this new one was what I needed to kick off the summer blockbuster season. And it did just that. It was still pretty stupid. The acting, overall, was pretty bad too, but there were surprisingly some pretty great performances and dialogue between some of the main characters, which was actually somewhat enjoyable and funny. Probably funnier than the actual ""comedy"" opening right alongside this one, The Hangover Part 3. The thing I enjoy most about these films, though, is the stunt work combined with pretty decent special effects. These movies are so over the top but the it's good to know that although the plot to these things aren't well thought out, the technical aspect of it all is stellar, and some of these scenes, especially with some friends, can be a blast once you see them. This movie gets so over the top that it takes away from what I liked about fast five so much: how tension built up to the unbelievable action sequence at the end. This time around, Lin puts in so much action that there's literally no room to breathe. This is why I'm still debating whether fast five or fast six was better. Fast Six definitely had a better clan, but the steady pacing in five makes me like the 2011 release a little more. It still does not change the fact that fast Six is so fun to watch. I'd say, ignore the critics and take this movie for what it is: dumb manliness portrayed on film. This movie is loads of fun. 73/100",TheSoFlyGuy1359,5/25/13,2013
159,8,Fast paced ride,"Initially i was a lil skeptical about watching this one. No matter how strong the cast of this is and especially all the previous racers and characters coming together, it was a SEQUEL and usually they are disappointing. But this one i bet is one of the best sequels ever.. Keeps up to the name it definitely is fast, almost throughout there is no dull moment and you just can't afford to even blink your eye! Justin lin has sketched each character so magnificently, that you just can't avoid it. Great storyline and full of past paced action, Lin keeps you guessing in this one. The action sequences look for real and impressive. Though all the previous stars are back in this one, every single one of them has an important role to play, and every single one of them looks good. But YET they all look ohh so fresh.. The background score keeps you alive, and execution spellbound. Especially the 1st introduction seen of Shaw and the car chase on Spanish highway.. But the showstopper is the finale, the climax on the military base. Every actor has looked impressive, Vin diesel is impressive love struck leader out to save his girl, Dwayne Johnson as high on muscle supercop (resembles the role of Roadblock from GI Joe), Tyrese impresses with his comic timing and paul walker is good.. Sung kang and Ludicrous are great too in the performances, but What impresses me most are Michelle Rodriguez and Luke evans as the ultimate antagonist. He looks stylish amazing and absolutely classy in his role. Probably the best he has looked so far. Overall, the movie keeps you stuck on the seat, and yes there is a bit of a surprise element by the end of this one and i am sure you would be waiting for the next installment after that.. So make sure you do watch till the closing numbers start!!! Fast was this and made surely someone else furious for 7!!",shraysharma85,5/25/13,2013
160,7,"Good action movie, but doesn't fully live up to its past","I am a a big fan of the Fast and Furious franchise, I own them all. Typically I rank them according to my beliefs as to how well they were done. In my mind, from best to worst: 5,4,1,3, and 2. When I look at Fast 6, I would have to put it somewhere between 4 and 1.Here's why I think this: the Fast and Furious franchise was based on the premise of fast, gorgeous cars and the shades of gray between good and bad, mostly marketed towards the gear head segment of the population. With Fast 5, we see that they are now trying to re-brand the franchise as a heist series with cars as the central method for pulling off these heists. Fast 5 did this spectacularly in my opinion, but Fast 6 was a step down. First of all, the cars were not given as much emphasis as even Fast 5 did. The fact that many of the driving sequences in this movie happen at night and the cars are mainly painted dark colors shows a distinct movement away from the car culture that made the series so popular.Secondly, this movie seems to try too hard to be funny at times. In the previous movie, there was a definite light-heartedness about the characters and their banter, but in Fast 6 the humor is not that funny and tends to be forced into inappropriate times and places.Bottom line: if you go to this movie expecting it to be a perfect continuation of the excellence of the previous movie you will be disappointed. However, if you go to see beautiful cars crash, things blow up, and epic fistfights this is the summer movie for you.",regula1,5/24/13,2013
161,1,Flat and Farcical 6,"What do you do if a bad guy intends stealing a device that could threaten the population of the entire world? Do you send in the Marines to sort him out? Perhaps Special Forces? May be a crack team of operatives trained in covert operations? Of course not, you get someone from an unknown department that looks like he has overdone the steroids and likes wearing tight t-shirts,(Wayne Johnson), to approach a crew of law breakers who can drive cars fast slamming them into the gears at the same time as hammering the throttle. Obvious really! They can chase the baddies at high speed through city centres including London ( some chance - I hope they paid the congestion charge or they will have broken the law even further), or stop him the bad guy when he is driving a tank along a Spanish highway by just using a bit of steel cable and an old 1970's Ford Escort. This was a truly dreadful film whose script must have been written on the back of a cereal packet using a crayon. The acting was as bad as the storyline. Diesel Van looked more like a man sent to clear your blocked toilet. Unfortunately he didn't do it with this pile of hokum.

I marked this review as containing spoilers but it's hard to imagine how a comment could spoil it any more.

The film also contained numerous product placements and ended with a barbecue where an obvious brand bottle of ketchup had it's name covered by a bit of red tape. Perhaps they refused to have their name associated with this rubbish movie.",simply-232-561758,6/11/13,2013
162,7,Fast cop cars??,"I don't know if someone has mentioned it before, but i just don't get it how the cops are able to follow, let alone catch up with these high powered customised cars. Why spend all their time customising and tuning the cars if they could easily steal a tiny little cop car :). This is the case in loads of pursuits in movies and it really annoys me. On the other hand, Furious 6 has a nice storyline, and the London surroundings give movie a nice Classy touch to it... Furthermore, the whole cast from the original movie is pretty much together again and they put on a decent performance, teaming up with The Rock.Back to the level of the first movies if you ask me.",cybercooky,9/5/13,2013
163,6,Too Fast To Remember...,"FAST AND FURIOUS 6 is the sixth film in the Fast & Furious franchise. It's directed by Justin Lin, starring Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez and MANY more.The film starts off with Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) approaching Dom (Vin Diesel) about a case involving Shaw (Luke Evans) and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) who was assumed dead in the 4th segment of the series.NOTE: This review is written by a Fast & Furious fan.SO, the trailer of Fast & Furious 6 was everywhere by the time it came out and it literally caught everyone's attention, whether they were a fan or not. I, as usual, booked my ticket for the movie and hoped for the best... which isn't what I got.Now this is quite hard to explain, so I'll do my best. According to me, this film is great, no doubt. It has the fast cars, the hot chicks, the action, yet it is quite forgettable. Now, I've seen Fast & Furious 6 twice, so far, and I've tried my best to engross myself into the film, but FF6 fails to do that for me. It's like, a chase sequence will take place, and 20 minutes later, you try your best to remember what happened during that very sequence. So, to me, it has all the elements of a Fast & Furious film, yet, it fails to captivate and by the time you leave the cinema and reach home, the film just remains faintly in your head.Second problem of the film is: WHERE ARE THE CHASE SCENES? Oh my God, this is what makes a Fast & Furious film, and yet there were only 4 of them in this one. Alright, one involves a tank, and another involves an airplane, yet it does not suffice, compared to the earlier Fast Five which had plenty of chase scenes to get you engrossed in the film.But apart from the flaws, Fast & Furious 6 does have some enjoyable parts, like whenever there is an action or chase scene, it is quite fun. The comedy is quite entertaining at times and the post-credits scene is quite a cliff-hanger, involving a star who is going to make a great villain to Fast & Furious 7.In conclusion, I feel Fast & Furious 6 is half-baked. Honestly, from a Fast & Furious fan, its quite sad to say this, but FF6 doesn't hold a chance compared to Fast Five. It is fun at times, yet its extremely forgettable which makes it quite difficult to focus your attention on the screen.FAST & FURIOUS 6: 6/10",andre_rox99,6/8/13,2013
164,6,Some thoughts...,"I'll refrain from breaking down the entire film for you given that you've either seen it or are curious about watching it. So instead I'll just hit what I considered a few of the movies strong points and not so strong points.THE GOOD: The tank scene was surprisingly awesome to watch. I didn't expect the carnage they actually showed in the film, given it was a popcorn movie. The hand to hand fight scenes were also quite well done (most notably in the train station). Obviously the movie had tons of car chases that were well handled.THE BAD: The story was very weak. So tell me again why Diesel's team is the only group of people that can take down this bad guy? It's like they predicted that there would be tons of car chases. Why would you even assume that? Besides lots of plot issues the dialogue itself was a bit hard to get through. I will say that Tyrese's character was the high point of the film for me. Thank goodness he had his little quirk. It was definitely nothing special, but if you like the franchise you'll enjoy the movie. Not one I would necessarily recommend tho.",artistgp,6/7/13,2013
165,10,Connections,I want this movie to come out on DVD now so I can watch all the movies in the right order :P. I also love how people clapped when they thought Vin died. I was like have you not seen Tokyo drift? I also like how they connected this film to Tokyo drift. I finally get the back story on it. I loved this movie and am looking forward to them making more. I am also glad they brought in Statham. I was wondering why Vin came to Tokyo but now I know. All the connections in this film were done very well. It was good to see the full team back together again and them come back home where they belong. I am interested in seeing how Statham's role is for this movie if he plays the same type he does in his other movies.,simsjr88,5/25/13,2013
167,9,One extra point for leading the way in human decency,"Gee, unlike one of the most oddly, preposterously successful recent ""franchise"" movies, this one decides it will NOT fall into the ""let's make depressing entertainment"" category. In that ""other"" movie, the psychologically damaged love interest gets used sexually, and then a day later, just for good measure, shot in the face. In Furious 6, a love interest in the series actually comes back to life. Isn't this how movies are supposed to be made? Guys have been trained to walk out of movies wanting to be like the hero of the movie. The box office of Furious 6 restored my faith in mankind. OK, it hasn't eclipsed 1.2B, but there's still time left.",scasey,9/2/13,2013
169,10,very good,"Movie was up to the mark. There were lot of hilarious moments. Rock was excellent in the movie. All the characters gel up really well. Letty is back :D. The movie was fast and furious. The scene with the airplane in the climax is one of the highlights of the movie. I will give this a 10/10 rating right away. Don't miss it. go and watch it right away. I am very eager for the next installment now. the film is filled with all the high-octane speed chases and close combat scenes we've come to expect from the franchise. I think this is one of the best film in the franchise. As is the trend nowadays, the closing credits provide a teaser of what's to come. In a Tokyo-set interlude we are introduced to yet another popular action star who will likely join the fast and furious crew for joyride number seven. Keep those seat belts fastened. Fast & Furious 6 is back to wheel power.",varma333,5/25/13,2013
170,7,I'm going to be very straightforward,"I'm usually descriptive in my reviews, but I'm not going to do that for this movie. This movie is simple entertainment. It does not require any brain power to understand the storyline in this movie. Beautiful cars. Beautiful girls. Hunky men. Yeap. Epic.The second you start using your brain while watching the movie, you start noticing the idiocy that had taken place. For instance, how huge will Dwayne Johnson go before he just turns from the Rock into the Boulder?Also, at the very last scene, how long is the damn runway? I mean seriously?Regardless, I still enjoyed the movie. It entertained me, and as a petrol head, this movie is definitely enjoyable.Should you watch it? Yeah, why not.",bugus92,7/8/13,2013
171,2,Gone in 60 Secs...,"This movie should have been called Gone in 60 secs because that's when i felt like leaving. I'm giving this movie a 2 star rating because it was pretty cool when the 2 semi's crashed on the highway and exploded in slow-motion. Otherwise this franchise seems to have died off long ago. Its no longer about the cars and racing, but horrible subplots about people id rather see written off then saved. Paul Walker is as bad as ever, but good thing is he was barely in this. Vin Diesel is getting to old to act and its showing. The rock also seem's juiced up like always. Paul Walker is so bad i wanted to say it twice. If you are familiar with the newer Mission Impossible movies then you've pretty much already know the story. I would rather XXX then this POS. I still don't understand how the series has gone so very wrong since the 1st film was only half bad. You know how at the end of the 1st one... where Vin Diesel flips the cool classic car? I really wish it had landed on top of Paul Walker's car and killed them so this movie would have never existed.",wtfboomheadshot1337,6/6/13,2013
172,7,The climax of this movie on the airport runway . . .,". . . totally defies comprehension and the laws of physics. I challenge anyone in the world to view this 15 minutes of chaos carefully (give yourself a real chance, and watch it on a DVD at half-speed at least three times, pausing as you write) and then type up a synopsis and relate EVERYTHING that happens with a straight face. Not only is no human being up to this task, but it is really easy to picture the screenwriter dissolving in gales of laughter after a night of heavy drinking as he, she, or it could not soberly type up such a crazy sequence of illogical, unmotivated, and physically impossible events. Though it's a known fact that every Hollywood or Hong Kong ""action"" movie will feature a few of these ""clunker"" scenes in which the movie goer (if they're not passed out drunk, which is hard to do in most theaters) will scratch their head and say to themselves or their party, ""Did THAT just happen?!,"" (and the F&F series is more guilty of such viewer abuse than most), NEVER BEFORE has such a load of c@#$% been piled up in one scene!",tadpole-596-918256,6/19/13,2013
174,6,They Tried!!,"Though the movie was not that bad.. I don't think it was all that good either. It was just a movie with action...... When compared to some of the others in the series it stays with them....... I was expecting more... hoping that they would top fast 5. but they didn't.There were some good driving action scenes that's classic fast and furious but the movie felt unfinished. The teaser at the end of the movie was actually more exciting to me than most of the scenes in the movie and that's saying something.If you love the franchise don't miss the movie as it answers some questions, however if you are looking for a good action movie to kill a couple of hours....... Well this would not be my first choice... as a matter of fact it would not even be my second.",itrini123,7/22/13,2013
175,10,I loved it,"Yes, Yes, Yes, The film had my heart racing, the fight scene were great, the story was great, and the cars were awesome as usual. I can even accept the story line, and how everything ties into each other. Roman's character reminds me of my cousin, always got something to say, and keeps me shaking my head at him. Seeing Jason Statham at the end was a great surprise too. I'm hoping the next movie will have a great chase scene. This is one of few franchises were you don't want any of the characters to die, I like all of them, especially Han, he was one cool cat. keep the films coming guys, Vin you are a smart business man I tell ya, put me in a film too.....how about an audition for a new character on the team, who is longing to be part of a family, I do my own stunts to.",derekholloway,7/18/13,2013
176,6,Fast & Furious 6,"Watched this one in the local multiplex, honestly I am not an avid fanboy of this money-maker franchise, I am even not an advocate of racing vehicles, but the turning point comes when FAST FIVE (2011, 7/10) surprisingly catapults itself into a new level of sensory entertainment with its roller coaster ride and triumphantly revives the series' mass appeal to a younger generation and has grossed a series-high income means it has yet overstayed its welcome. Still helmed by Justin Lin, this 6th sequel reunites all the cast, including one of the ""original four"" Michelle Rodriguez, whose wacky insomnia and vague backstory stirs the most untenable veneer of the plot if one can excuse the physics-defying action sequences as an utmost drawing power to allure new genre lovers and retain its core audiences. So a large drawback of this one is it is solely made for one's eyes only, one should completely ignore what is the convoluted plot going on by the villain and his cohorts and plainly indulge oneself in the great stunt work to find it is worth your ticket. Unequivocally it is a tough job for any writer to create new blood for the franchise since it allows very limited leeway to inspire from the original cast, and due to the aesthetic fatigue, sooner or later, a younger cast must be mustered so as to invigorate a healthy metabolism for the faded set pieces. In this one, the newcomer is a strapping Luke Evans as the main villain, whose temperament presages a brighter future as a leading man candidate in world cinema, but unfortunately this film is not his breakthrough, at most a stepping stone permits him to be seen by more people and hence enlarges his fan base. Everyone else is pigeonholed with their respective task, Johnson bullies scumbags, Diesel emotionlessly sweet-talks with his comeback battle-axe, Walker retreats into a family man, Gibson and Ludicrous are the pair of cutups, the ass-kicking martial pro Carano is here for girl fights while Kang and Gadot cannot run away from their functional exit, which plausibly introduce another bankable name as the next villain for the next chapter, due next year and will be transferred to be under the reign of horror-genre whiz James Wan, let's pray for a miracle to sustain its longevity and if we are lucky enough, a better one next time!",lasttimeisaw,7/31/13,2013
177,8,Great action but a weak storyline (Spoiler Alert!),"I have always loved action movies, especially those which involve fast cars, explosions, preposterous plans and daring execution. Fast and the Furious Franchise gave me everything and more!! Vin Diesel is awesome for his role as Dom. For me the movie was great in all respects except one.

A NATO General, from within a secure NATO Base, gives away (or easily lets a gang of robbers drive away with) an absolutely critical piece of electronic hardware, which can potentially defeat an entire nation, just because one member of the lead character's family has been kidnapped is ridiculous. Juvenile. Unacceptable Story. Period.",Kartik_Kumar_Agarwal,5/25/13,2013
178,7,Justin Lin's Fast & Furious 6 (2013),"Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his friends are chillin' all over the globe, enjoying la dolce vita, after their successful heist in Fast Five (2011). However they're also longing to return home to America. Agent Hobbs (The Rock) offers them the opportunity to do just that: A clean slate in exchange for one last job. The mission includes taking down a villainous character (Luke Evans) in London, finding Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and driving fast cars, while doing crazy stunts, shooting and beating people up and stuff.Justin Lin's fourth entry in the franchise is mostly successful, thanks to an amiable cast, a cheesy, but sweet writing and some breathtaking action set pieces. The characters mostly derive from the actor's screen persona, which is not a bad thing per se, but some of the acting is stale and the screenplay doesn't really allow for much room for them to breathe and develop in a satisfying way. The action is very intense and interestingly shot in some instances, though you can sustain tension only so long, and so the last act results a bit too long. The film in general could use some leaner editing. Some scenes are basically useless, like Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) going to prison. Gina Carano's wrestling skills are impressive, but her character's twist at the end is completely pointless.Personally, I am biased to like this film, for purely nostalgic reasons: I grew up with this franchise. The film had me from the very beginning with the great opening title montage. In my estimation this is one of the few interesting franchises out there today. Borrowing too much from last year's box office hits The Avengers (exploiting the team of ""superheroes"" aspect, featuring a ""similar"" villain and also copying structural elements) and The Dark Knight franchise (the villain seems to be driving something out of a Christopher Nolan film); Furious 6 could have been better by doing its own thing like in the previous installment. The villain and his motivations are dubious and weakly executed. The result is a formulaic story. To its credit Furious 6 has a good sense of humor, but also a beautiful message about the importance of family. What I disliked was how some characters were treated, namely Roman (Tyrese Gibson) being reduced to comic relief, Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) hardly given anything to do and Elena (Elsa Pataky) completely ignored up until the end. The potential conflict between Dom's new girlfriend Giselle (Gal Gadot) and Letty also remained unexplored. The film ends on an upbeat note, but I just have a hard time buying that Brian is a father now. Stay tuned for more action to come – #7 was already announced.Verdict: Recommended. Especially if you're an action junkie, love the Fast & Furious franchise or just enjoy having Corona with your buddies and turn off your brain for 2 hours.",TheDelusionist,5/31/13,2013
179,9,"Fast Five reignited this series, Fast & Furious 6 has taken it even further.","The Fast & Furious series has seen some good times and not so good times. The series has been up and down since The Fast and the Furious released in 2001, and seems to have finally decided on a permanent name for the series. When 2011's Fast Five ushered in a new vision of the franchise, brought huge success and now Fast & Furious 6 has driven that success to heights I never thought I'd see in this series.This series is really supposed to be about two things: fast cars and furious action (pun absolutely intended) and this movie provides both on a large scale. Though some of the action scenes are a bit unrealistic and clichéd, they are intense and exciting enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. High speed highway chases, big time shootouts, and some excellent hand-to-hand combat are all in full effect here and make for some very entertaining action sequences. A little more on the fisticuffs, they really were quite exciting and very well choreographed. The build up to the eventual showdown between two female characters and two juggernauts is fun and the clashes are great. The cars and other vehicles in the movie are fast paced and never leave a dull moment where something is dragged out (except for the end of the movie). So again, some of the action scenes are clichéd and predictable, but are overall a joy to watch.Now the plot and the villain. The story again revolves around Dominic Toretto and his crew who accept one last job to ensure their freedom. Things go awry, and the crew is forced into a much larger conflict than originally expected. The story takes some unexpected turns and keeps you interested for the vast majority, but at times was a little too rushed and got confusing. It wasn't the best story in an action movie I've ever seen, but it wasn't the worst either. The movie's romantic sub plot involving Dominic and Letty was good. It never made you bored and added to the emotional side a little bit. The villain, Owen Shaw, is a good antagonist. At first, he doesn't seem to pose a huge threat and is sometimes boring to get into, but eventually really shows his dark side making up for his lack of character development in the early parts of the film. The cast is great. Vin Disel (Toretto), Paul Walker (Brain O'Conner), Dwayne Johnson (Hobbs), and Luke Evans (Shaw) among many other do a great job of bringing the movie to life. Some of the supporting cast such as Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous bring a solid slate of humor to keep the film fresh while Michelle Rodriguez (Letty) and Gina Carano (Riley) provide strong female roles that aren't often seen in action films. A shout out as well to director Justin Lin, who has taken an almost dead series after Tokyo Drift and reinvented it into the fast-paced action- heavy movies we again know.I love this series. The Fast and the Furious was a highly entertaining film while the next two movies were weak. Fast & Furious in 2009 was a step up and then again, Fast Five was a new and improved direction for the series which spanned F&F6 and the already announced Fast & Furious 7 slated for a July 2014 release. This movie may at times suffer from minor cases of clichés (and the longest runway in film history), but the top heavy action sequences, highlighted by terrific fight scenes and fast paced vehicular mayhem, plentiful and entertaining humor, great cast and acceptable story more than make up for those corny parts. The Fast & Furious series (which is hopefully the name they're sticking to), is back on the map and at top form. An end credits scene connects the dots between Tokyo Drift and the since announced Fast & Furious 7, so stick around to build up even more hype for next summer's big blockbuster.8.5/10 (my score is rounded to 9 on the website's rating)",slicedbread117,8/29/13,2013
184,6,the movie,"i love all the fast and furious movies but to tell you the truth, the makers have gone way off track with the action. The first 3, fast and the furious, 2 fast 2 furious were all about the cars and the family, the story. Now its all about chasing after someone. If the next one, fast 7 is like this, its going to be the biggest disappointment. to the greatest movie ever made.they need to bring it back to LA where it all began. and stay there. No more long as gun fights, planes, tanks. all that stuff. Because whats the point of calling the movies fast and furious. if it has nothing to do with anything like the first couple of movies.I like how they brought it all together, bringing Letty back, but you really don't need all the stuff in between.",suprer_badboy_19,7/8/13,2013

Life is very simple when you have a passion, principle and strength to follow them.

Best one of the series. Looking forward to the twist in the next one.

It is hard to imagine what can top the tank and the airplane sequence. Maybe the Statham's charisma :)

186,6,Solid action movie!,"First thing to know if you're new to the Fast and Furious movies is that there are some unrealistic action sequences. So if you have a problem with that don't waste your time. But if you can sit back and enjoy a good action movie without giving to much credit to those scenes then you're up for a kick ass time with Fast and Furious 6. The characters are very good and keeping ""The Rock"" on the movie is very positive. I think he makes a great duo with Vin Diesel. The story isn't very elaborate, and that's the way it should be in this type of movie, but it deliver's. Fast and Furious 6 is one of the best action movies around these days, so give it a shot. 7 out of 10 !",beyonder-3,9/17/13,2013
187,8,Just when we thought that it couldn't get bigger,"""The Rock"" is not the only one who got bigger. The whole movie goes to a massive level never before seen in the franchise. The creators of this franchise must ask themselves with each movie: How do we make this bigger? Because is getting ridiculous how massive are the racing scenes on Furious 6 (yes, that's the title showed in the intro). Well, there are not exactly racing scenes on this one (safe for one), it their place the writer puts a lot of car chasing scenes. There are so much persecution scenes on this movie that every character suffers at least one big accident in which, of course, none of them gets hurt. Everyone survives accidents that could finish with all the nine lives of a cat, without a single scratch. Between that and sort scene on a bridge involving certain characters flying on the air, the phrase ""Oh common!"" is useless in this one. That said, it is clear that we are not talking about an Academy Award Winner movie. We are talking about the Die Hard of racing cars. All the car sequences are great, full with action and emotion. Every single fan is going to be pleased at the end of the film. The story is very simple. There is a bad guy. Letty is working with him. The crew must bring Letty back home. The truth is that it works. The focus point of the film is to discover how she survives and why she didn't came back home. At least I can say that they came up with a good explanation of how that happens. But it must be clear that everything here has been made to please the fans. In other words, there are some decisions made in this film that if you think about it you will probably be disappointed. So is better if you just enjoy the ride and don't think about it too much. The theme is the family. That's actually how (finally) the cast is feeling. On Fast Five there are characters knowing each other, but in this one everybody knows everybody. So they're one big family in the film and it is perceive as if they have become one big family outside the set. Even Hobbs feels like part of the family, even being a cop. The new guy is the villain, Sebastian Shaw (Luke Evans). He did a fine job and maybe that's because he is a good actor or because at last we have a bad guy who isn't a drug dealer. Shaw is more like a terrorist, so he is more memorable than the others. Universal Pictures has confirmed the seventh film for July 2014 release date. That means that, even when we got a close ending, if you stay 10 more seconds you will witness an extra scene. In that scene we close one character gap (sadly but at last), and we're introduced the new bad guy. And he makes an impression on both, ladies and men. With that scene the producers make a statement: Fast & Furious 7 will be bigger than this.",damh_frikinlater,5/23/13,2013
189,10,"The Fastest, and The Most Furious!","This edition ""took-it-all"". Fast car chases, furious fight scenes, and an engaging story-line with a nice ""twist"" in the end.

I am convinced that they'll have a ""very"" difficult time following this act. However, when you see the end, you'll without-a-doubt conclude that a ""Fast 7"" is already in the works.

The villain in this film has many tentacles, and a family of His own that could lead to even more intrigue in a 7th film. Michelle Rodriguez was amazing in the reprisal her role as Letty, and her fight scene with Gina Carano would make even Chuck Norris smile.

Overall, it was Tyrese Gibson's character that added the most significant amount of laughs. What I did find amazing about this franchise is that each film seems to out-do it's predecessor. Should there be a 7th film (and there will be), the film-makers will have their work cut-out for them, because this movie out-did the others by light years....

190,6,Worth the ticket,"Fast and Furious 6 is quite on par with the rest of the movies in the series. Not the best, but definitely not the worst. The first hour and a half were quite good, and I didn't understand what the other reviewers were complaining about. It felt just like the other movies, and some parts were even better. But the last two action sequences were exaggerated.The good about Fast and Furious 6: All the members of the team were busy and had their parts. This is the first time that they were actually matched with a tough rivals. Luke Evans played his character well, and he had a crew that was physically tough, sophisticated and well equipped. The return of Letty is good thing as well. Michelle Rodriguez was perfect.The bad: The exaggerated last action sequences. It's not that Fast 5 had a credible last scene. It didn't have, but I didn't think about it when I was watching it. It was just fun. Here I found myself thinking 'this is too much'. Another think is Hobbs. I liked him in the fifth movie. Here I find him slightly annoying. And some fights in the end felt redundant. I think that if the director have settled on more casual action, instead of choosing the bigger but much less credible action, it would be better.",athena24,6/15/13,2013
191,1,"""Seems legit.""","After the trailer brought down my expectations for this movie, I reminded myself that this was just an action flick. However, after watching, I concluded that it even failed at being that; a myriad of idiotic, clich�, maddeningly impossible scenes followed, ruining immersion and causing me to think to myself, ""SEEMS LEGIT"". Let's go over some improbable, immersion ruining scenes, shall we?

-An incompetent police force that conveniently leaves a small gap while surrounding the garage of a criminal they are trying to catch -A thin, metal cable that can immediately stop a semi going at 70 MPH, and doesn't tear out of the wall/cut the semi in half -A tank that drives at 70 MPH on a highway -Said tank, that after crushing dozens of civilian cars, for some reason doesn't crush the car of one of the protagonists -A character that can jump across bridges, catch another character, land on a car, and be fine -A 30 mile plane runway -People who get hit by cars multiple times and get up

To be honest, I didn't pay much attention to this movie after a couple of these moments, so maybe there were explanations for some of these, but I don't really care. These moments broke immersion and ruined an otherwise okay action flick.",justtrolling,5/31/13,2013

After Rio, Toretto's family: Dominic, O Conner, Mia are now at Europa, and Hobbs ask them for help because a Russian ex-military is planning traffic with a powerful weapon; one argue is convincing: Letty is alive. Spectacular sequences, big cars, London, and Spain Highways are the complement for this movie. When we think that the movie is ending, takes places a story change. One of the think that like me from the movie is that between lines they promote the value of the family, and one dialog from Toretto show this: ""�Do not turn your back on your family even if they give it to you if�"".

Of the 6 movies made, some where adrenaline pumping, exciting and some were plain old lame. This one stands somewhere in the middle.

The opening sequence of the movie is brilliant, and it sets the mood for the movie. It gets you all excited. And then 15 minutes in to the film, you realize you're drifting father away from the storyline (because it doesn't have one). You get eager to get on with to the parts with all the action, but alas! it doesn't come.

The locations in the movie are breathtaking and so are the cars. The cars! From the M5, 69 Mustang to the Daytona (albeit not the original). Oh, and don't forget the tank. They blew up a tank! The chase sequences are brilliant, as usual. But here's what bothers me. Every time the actors shift their gears you realize that they're driving an automatic. So many gear changes in an automatic? Amateurish.

The acting is mediocre. I believe Dwayne Jhonson had only one motive for the movie, to look big - he does. Its daunting to see him on the screen. Justin Lin (director) was not able to put him on screen with 2 other actors, because they just wouldn't fit the screen! As for the rest, Paul Walker & Vin Diesel put up good performances, Ludicrous & Tyrese Gibson are the comic relief and the female actors are a little more than eye candy.

The plot is as boring and nonchalant as a B grade Hollywood flick. All throughout the movie you keep telling yourself that the movie is about to explode. But it doesn't.

The music is good and in lieu with the flow of the movie. The direction is nothing out of the ordinary, and you don't expect it to be for a movie like this.

The ending sequence is quite thrilling to say the least and the gang take out an army cargo airplane. But all throughout the sequence you keep asking yourself, when does the runway end?!

All in all, a good entertainer. Post credits you're in for a surprise as The Man is introduced in to the franchise. Be sure to go and watch movie after having a couple of beers.",the_pious_satan,5/25/13,2013
197,8,Looking Forward to The Sequel,"This film was very enjoyable. I was engrossed in it all the way through. One particular part I liked the most was how they were literally against themselves and how Hobbs and Dom had to work together - which at first seemed unthinkable but I think this added so much to the film.

One thing I like in films is how they bring back scenes or moments from the previous ones so that it adds more emotion to the film and allows you to get into the minds of the characters. This film provided a fine balance of them and I feel that this added more depth to the film as it highlights their past and what they are still living with emotionally. One example I liked the most was when Dom was given the picture of Letty at the start of the film.

I must single out Gibson's character as he was so funny and how his one-liners had me in hysterics. I did get sentimental when they reminded him how big his forehead was.

The action was intense at times and at some points hard to believe because of the creativity. One of my favourite parts was the scene where they raid the convoy and try to steal the tank that it is transporting. The locations were intriguing as they were in different cities. One city that I found the most interesting was London. Because the city is so notoriously bad to drive in they made it look so easy. Also the scenes in the subway that actually made me zone out because I was just so into it.

Now.. the bad guy. I loved him; He was so methodical and calculating and reminded me of an evil Sheldon (Big Bang Theory) mixed with a psychopath.

One big twist was when they decided to let Shaw go as he had Mia being held captive. Then he says are you ready to go to the crew there and I assumed he was talking to Letty and then Hobbs assistant goes and I was like oh my god oh my god. This film had so many surprises and I thought it was thoroughly enjoyable.",lewisfindley3,9/23/13,2013
198,7,Just like F&F5,"For what I'm about to say, please remember that I gave the movie 7 stars and I really did enjoy it. That being said...

Argh, you directors/screenwriters etc make me so angry! It's always the same with you people. You just don't know where to draw the line. Why do always seem to HAVE TO top the previous film in terms of action scenes? Would it kill you to just create thrilling, SLIGHTLY over the top action scenes, instead of these stupidly overdone action highlights? Those scenes are singlehandedly responsible for the movie being 'good' rather than 'great'.

I'm talking of course about scenes like Dom and Letty flying through the air (I'd say a solid 25 meters) only to land on the windshield of a car. What's up gravity? No severe injuries? So what a car is like an air cushion or something? Then you have your shamelessly overdone end scene. The plane rolls and rolls - they fight, shoot, fire spearguns at the thing, ans then fight some more - but how long does it take a plane to finally go up in the air? How long is that runway??? 20km? The moment of take-off usually takes a few seconds. This plane, however, stays in a quasi-take-off-state for a good 3 minutes.

It's. Just. So. Painful. To. Watch.

Hollywood, you don't need the impossible to impress me. I love car chases, well-choreographed fight scenes, humor and good characters. Fast 6 has all of that! My advice for 7? Keep up the (really) great work and lose the stupid bull***!!! The movie will be better for it!",dschlatter,5/24/13,2013
199,8,A spectacular action fest with emotional depth,"Get the wheels rolling and adrenaline pumping,Fast and Furious returns and the stakes are higher than ever.There is a new enemy named Shaw and he has gathered a formidable crew who are up to no good.They have already wrecked havoc in Moscow and now set their sights on a device that can cause a military catastrophe.When the going gets tough you need the tough to get you going.Who else to counter such an enemy than our very own fast and furious team.A top police officer Luke Hobbs(Dwayne Johnson) approaches Dominic(Vin Diesel) to seek help.Dominic has retired and would normally deny but there is a twist.Letty(Michelle Rodrigues),Dominic's girlfriend who is believed to be dead has been spotted.Dominic agrees and recalls his team.What follows is a face off between the two teams.I am not a fan of mindless action movies.Fortunately this is n't one.This is a very interesting plot with lots of emotional quotient in the movie and the concept of togetherness,camaraderie and standing up for family is touched frequently.In fact more so here than any of the previous movies which was something i enjoyed.The wisecracks are awesome and the dialog in general brilliant.Dwayne Johnson is becoming a better actor and the tough cop role suits him .Vin Diesel and Paul Walker were amazing.For me Michelle Rodrigues as Letty walks away with the crown.Tough,Sexy and conflicted,she delivers a great performance.The rest of the cast does well too.Always good to see the banter between Roman(Tyrese Gibson) and Tej(Ludicrous).The score keeps you interested.The action is just superb.I wont give anything away but the kind of stuff the team pulls off will blow your mind.Overall Fast and Furious Six is a fiery action ride but is a movie with an emotional soul to it!",vishalsmail33,5/23/13,2013
201,1,Whatever active brain cells I had left is now ... blip,"I must get my head checked to have paid money to watch this film. I am extremely disappointed with myself, actually really disappointed with myself for contributing to the 588 million that this film has made. I was happy when I contributed to films like The Reluctant Fundamentalist and Dead Man Down, but Fast & Furious 6? Oh Man.

Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are the laziest actors on set. It seemed so obvious that they are extremely tired of this franchise and just want out. Vinny and Paulie simply couldn't be bothered with his lines and even mustering up enough energy to make the scenes believable. Vinny says, ""...make sure they're fast."" Who wrote this stuff?

That anorexic chick, Gisele and her affair with Han, oh it was painful to watch. How he kept saving her and that loving look in her eyes every time he would swoop in and carry her to safety. I think that was even more staged and manufactured than Vinnie's romantic scene with Michelle's character, Letty. Michelle Rodriguez is a good actress that has been pigeon holed as a tough chick. Maybe she's happy with it, I don't know. But come on, Vinnie, learn to act again, please. You kinda owe it to people who pay money to watch you, ya know.

At the start of the film, like 2 minutes in, I was actually interested because there's been this robbery and the people responsible made sure they destroyed half the block before they left. They meant business and Luke Hobbs desperately wants to track them down. Ah, mystery, investigation ... and it dies there. The remaining minutes were a series of lame scenes, unbelievable settings, poor character motivations, a clumsy black dude, the sound of car engines, the sound of car engines and the sound of car engines. 30 minutes in, I was wishing for the villain, Shaw to drop everybody and be done with it. I was wishing for Shaw to succeed in stealing that freaking microchip. Of course, when he started driving that tank, I knew he would fail very predictably. I think the writer Chris Morgan practiced screen writing working on the Ultraman franchise. At least I like watching Ultraman.",dparan,6/12/13,2013
203,6,Lives Up to the Title Perfectly,"It's Fast! It's Furious! It's Number 6 in the franchise! It's dumber than a box of rocks, or maybe an avalanche of rocks on speed. It's pretty much a live-action remake of Cars II. Vin Diesel and The Rock are fun to watch, but you can only take so many physically impossible car stunts and physiologically impossible fights. I picture this film being used as a cure for ADHD the way the character in A Clockwork Orange was cured of violence. ""Oh, look, something shi- Nooo! Not the London street race scene again!"" Supervillain Owen Stark is collecting the components for a superweapon that can black out a whole country. Why the components are scattered instead of assembled is never made clear. The last item is a computer chip which, instead of being hidden in a desk drawer or just smashed with a hammer, is transported to a new location in a heavy carrier containing, for some reason, a tank. Stark and his baddies steal the tank and smash a lot of cars. They are captured but it can't be that easy, can it? No, it's not. They've had other henchmen take the wife of one of Vin Diesel's guys hostage. So now we have another car chase, plus a plane chase, plus boarding the plane through the loading ramp, plus three or four simultaneous fights, followed by a plane crash. Oh, look for a Jason Statham crossover next time.",dutchs-1,6/12/13,2013
204,7,Movie is good but not great,Movie was good but not great as fast.5 they have to work on script in upcoming movie and chose more car racing scene as compare to gun fight or hand fight. Vin diesel was excellent . Paul walker is disappointing. the rock Johnson is not up to the mark he has to work on his acting ability not only on body building . In my opinion jasan statham is much better choice then the rock . some scene was beyond reality and some scene looking not very well scripted . Vin diesel have to put more of his scene then others. direction was good editing was good cast is not up to the mark. all on all it was a good one time watch movie 7 stars out of 10 stars. better luck next time.,wajahat-ghazali,5/29/13,2013
206,6,Script is a little dull and lifeless,"It's not that the movie was bad, just that it became pretty absurd at points and essentially lost all credibility. Now obviously I expect an element of action not possible in reality but when you've got guys jumping out of cars across a bridge while a tank is exploding and then surviving all the while spitting out lame one liners.

Although the ""Fast and Furious 6"" contained unimpressive acting but believable acting and a cheesy dialogue, it was an action filled entertaining movie with comedy and a great plot. And just by the fact that they ended the movie with a cliffhanger that connected to the third instalment of the ""Fast"" saga, ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" makes me want to go and see the seventh instalment set for 2014.",jpfloydster,12/21/13,2013
208,6,Dom is at it again,"Having resurrected the series after the critically panned sequel – 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS - returning director Justin Lin rigs this sixth installment with an action packed cocktail of nitrous oxide and adrenalin; a perfectly blended chemical compound that will have you laughing out loud even as you clench your toes through the film's high-octane action sequences.Picking up where FAST 5 ended, US Diplomatic Security Service Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) grants fugitives Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and former FBI Agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) a full pardon if they help him take down criminal mastermind Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). Toretto is of course uninterested, until Hobbs reveals that Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is alive but working for Shaw. A far as the synopsis goes, that's all you need to know, because that's all there is to it. To be fair, the FAST & FURIOUS saga has always been about high speed races and chases and less about character development or a mindboggling story. And Like the preceding films, the background story in this sixth installment is literally in the back seat, with emphasis on the ride rather than the destination. Neither is FURIOUS 6 the type of film inclined towards rocket scientists or viewers searching for logic. George Smiley burrowing after a Soviet spy within MI6? No. Regular doses of humour, peppered with death-defying stunts? Yes, and there is a truck load of it and it comes at you just as the title promises. This, essentially, is what makes FURIOUS 6 subjectively indulgent, with or without the popcorn. However, there is food for thought and fans of the series could be split debating whether or not this film is the best in the series. Although Lin injects a fresh canister of cinematic nitro, this latest episode lacks a worthy antagonist even though this film has the largest character ensemble in the series. On that note, characters don't die and dead ones are brought back. While there is a timeline-unknotting-explanation for that, the fact remains that Shaw is heavily outnumbered, and it shows. After five globetrotting adventures, Dom's 'family' has increased in size with many characters reappearing from previous films. In addition, Hobbs is no longer an advisory and along with his team of Special Forces sharp-shooters, becomes Dom's souped-up armory on wheels. There are also issues with continuity amid rip-off moments from iconic action films (think Lethal WEAPON 3). Through all the vehicular carnage, characters can take a beating, and still appear unfazed and unharmed. This carries on till the final skirmish onboard a cargo plane on a take-off run, on what has to be the world's longest runway! Real pilots in the audience would probably wet themselves laughing. But despite its flaws, some even absurd, FAST & FURIOUS 6 is a high energy action movie and competently made. Fans are treated to having Rodriguez back and there is a whole subplot about her 'new' character. Tyrese Gibson is also back but this time, more than ever, serves one real purpose and that is to shoot out some well-timed one-liners. As a summer opener, it not only revs up the fun-o-meter but also hurtles past the competition as a lucrative action film franchise. Bruce Willis - kindly heed that last line. While it is unusual for sequels to get better with each release, the FAST & FURIOUS franchise seems to mature with age and there is a very strong suggestion of a seventh installment. An end credits scene confirms this with the introduction of a new character. Pay attention to the film's baldness joke and you might just figure out who joins the cast in the next movie. If you do, you might also win premier passes for FAST & FURIOUS 7!",LloydBayer,9/8/13,2013
211,1,You will love this movie... if you're 12 years old,"I got suckered/tricked into watching this movie with friends, otherwise I would never have watched it. I quit watching the F&F series after the second movie; so I haven't seen parts 3,4 and 5.The whole concept and the plot of these movies are of course completely ridiculous. But obviously many people don't care about that. At the time of writing this movie has a rating of 7,7 at IMDb. This high rating can easily be explained. Since it's part 6 of the series, most people know what to expect. People who don't like the previous parts, will not bother to watch part 6. So I'm assuming mostly die hard F&F fans have watched it in the cinema and they have given the movie a high rating. You can't rate a movie if you haven't watched it...I won't go into details of the movie, but trust me, if you're an adult and not easily impressed by all things shiny, this movie is not for you. I watched this in an IMAX theater and still not a single action scene could impress me. Don't get me started on the plot, humor, dialogue etc.Since many people use IMDb ratings to find out whether a movie is any good, I have voted 1 out of 10; to offset the high ratings that a lot of F&F fans have given. Otherwise I might have given it a 2.",diniz-702-167623,6/3/13,2013
212,7,ride on the 6th gear.....,"thumps up for Justin Lin...he captured the speeding cars tremendously...the action scenes were awesome.Plot was just OK for the movie.. Tyrese Gibson..created good humor cast performance was good...but diesel rocked. action scenes were played in a very nice and synchronized manner. Cars were out of the world .The plot was not that catchy ... the movie opens on a speeding scene between Vin diesel and Paul walker,speeding to Mia Toretto as she was on to deliver.the all were settled family man until Dwayne Johnson..seeks for their help to solve an on going military utilities robbery..the team of Vin agree's to help in the condition of his and his teams freedom ,he was also very desperate to know how his x girl friend Letty Ortiz was alive,this is the basic purpose of the movie.the plot of ff6 is very much related to fast and furious 4 and 3.so it will be better if you know the summary of both the movies THE TANK SCENE AND THE PLANE SCENE will rock u .. overall the movie worths your money..,nd will leave u exited for its next sequel..which stars Jason Statham..",asu-ray20,5/29/13,2013
218,7,Exaggerated Villains....,"First of all, this movie is quite awesome, but not as good as Fast 5 which IMO is the best of all FF franchise. The plot is more simple with a predictable twist in the end. The story also serves for wrapping up all the FF series for a grand finale in FF7 so it loads with lots character and effort to tie those loose ends (but not convincing enough) in previous sequel and rearrange the series in order so we can see now that FF3 is actually the FF6. So no wonder, there are some unnecessary scenes (ie Connor meets Braga in jail) which make less portion of actions scenes.The FF team become more solid in this sequel, everyone has a good portion to show their character and role in the movie. I think Han & Gisele relationship here somehow is more subtle & memorable than ""it'a all about family"" excuses that Dom and others bragging about throughout the film.However, the villain team is under my expectation. They are not as Hobbs, Braga or others picture them to be. They don't look scary, mean or dangerous to me, they just look tense and a bit nervous, except Shaw and that big Russian guy. While Shaw indeed is a cool and thinker mastermind, it's hard to believe that he is as powerful as Braga said. He doesn't have that powerful and dominant charm/aura.So 7 out of 10 from me.",adhipar,5/27/13,2013

224,7,"""Furious 6"" Review","Let's get it out of the way, ""Furious 6"" is an insanely stupid movie. The acting is horrendous, the writing is worse, and the plot is thinner than a playing card. However, despite all of these flaws, this film is immensely entertaining. It's fast, full of energy, and one liners that will have you rolling on the floor. It's a film that knows exactly what it is and what it wants to achieve. It isn't afraid to mix over the top action with sappy melodrama. The film has its own unique style and is filled with what young people today refer to as ""swag."" Justin Lin has done wonders with this franchise. The racing/car chase sequences are well shot and edited. The audience really feels apart of the experience. Along with the fast and adrenaline infused car sequences, this film has the best hand to hand combat so far this year. The fights are well choreographed, shot, and edited to a point were I almost feel every punch and kick being thrown. There are some ridiculous set pieces in this film, but they are exciting and entertaining as heck. I was literally at the edge of my seat even when my brain was telling me that what is happening is totally idiotic.I feel that I don't really have to talk about the actors or characters at this point. Mainly due to the fact that they've been around for so long and also because they're not the main reason for why we go see these films. I know they have a special place in our hearts now, but they aren't all too interesting or filled with enough depth to go into detail. However, I do love how we feel apart of their family.Overall, ""Furious 6"" is a very entertaining and fun film. The plot, writing, and characters may be dumb, but hey, this series is like family and no matter how stupid or dumb it can be, we love it no matter what. Especially when we have physics defying stunts, a great soundtrack, and The Rock. I give it 3.5/5, a popcorn flick that knows exactly what the audience wants.",TheConnoisseurReviews,5/29/13,2013
226,7,Super fun but very OTT,"Fast and Furious 6

*** (out of 4)

130 mins/ 12

Cast: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Jordana Brewster, Luke Evans, Michelle Rodriguez, Sung Kang, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Gal Gadot

Director: Justin Lin

Plot: After discovering Letty is still alive, Dom and Brian help Hobbs take down the criminal she is now working for.

JJ's Verdict: The Fast and Furious franchise has come a long way since the first instalment back in 2001. That film was all about cars and racing and its first three sequels followed suit. That all changed with Fast Five in 2011, which was more of a heist film and involved more action and less racing to attract a larger audience. This was welcomed back then, but with Fast and Furious 6, director Justin Lin has made the action bigger; but not necessarily better. Earlier this year, I said A Good Day to Die Hard had over the top action but this film is over the over the top. It is however, unlike that Die Hard, stylish and enjoyable. And although the actual concept of Vin Diesel jumping in the air and while still in the air, head-butting a man twice the size of him, is cool, you can't help thinking it is completely unnecessary and ridiculous. The action scenes themselves had such good editing and precision that it was hard to concentrate on them and it certainly hurt my eyes.

The plot itself is a bad one. The idea to resurrect Letty considering she had a funeral and burial in Fast and Furious 4 is totally absurd. It does however not distract too much from Luke Evans' villain Shaw. His character is certainly the most memorable of all previous Fast and Furious bad guys and the Welshman plays it sinister and cold , bringing a fresh air to the scene as the film's only new principal character. Paul Walker's acting has come a long way and along with Diesel, shows off great emotional acting skills which have previously (although attempted particularly by Walker) failed to impress. Tyrese Gibson gets some very funny lines in this one and his chemistry with Ludicrous is nothing short of both brilliant and hilarious. Dwayne Johnson is once again robbed of his hard man status as baby oil and 'Captain America' jokes are made at him constantly.

Not only is the action unrealistic here, but the setting itself. Set partly in London, the film depicts London as a street-racing city with races taking place straight through the centre of it. I can assure you that no street racing anywhere near this scale takes place in London and although I don't mind them smashing it to pieces, I wish they could put some realism into it. Another realism point is that if 200 people were watching 3 policemen being beaten up by a criminal, would one of them help them? Apparently not.

Fast and Furious 6, although terribly unrealistic, even for an action film, is lots of fun and certainly enjoyable. And to add to the excitement, it gives us a brilliant hint to what Fast and Furious 7 will be like on its release in just over a year.",jjgooner,7/6/13,2013

***************************************

For those that are fans of Fast & Furious, and those that like super action movies, this is totally entertaining times 10. The stunts and the race scenes were over the top, and the comedy one liners added to a good plot for our heroes. The cinematography and music score was excellent, and the occasional rap song even had me moving to the beat.

Dom ( Vin Diesel ) and Brian ( Paul Walker ) and their crew are living lavishly all over the globe after the big heist, but can not return to the United States for fear of being arrested.

Luke Hobbs ( Dwayne Johnson ) is tracking an elite group of lethal mercenaries across 12 countries trying to foil their master plan. Hobbs tries to recruit Dom and his team to take them down, by using a picture of Letty ( Michelle Rodriguez ) whom Dom thought she was dead.

This movie is fast moving, and takes several surprise turns that keeps the story line realistic.

Then the big surprise in last 3 minutes reveals another bad guy that that will take us to FAST & FURIOUS 7. Who is he ? Someone we all know as an action player, and one that most people would be the last to guess.

So fasten your seat belts. You will be in for a bumpy ride !!!",iMovieCritic-666-701399,5/21/13,2013
231,1,terrible,"I cannot believe that someone can give this movie 5 or more stars and says it is great. Ha, ha. I give it 2 stars, but I rate it 1 to counter balance the other overrated reviews. Basically terrible script and terrible story. Acting is a joke. Let's see one example. Terrorists want to grab a computer chip from the military base but soldiers instead of protecting it in the base send it out somewhere. Very stupid idea generally since military base is a fortress. But OK, let's pretend that this is some kind of protocol. So what does this convoy have? One truck and two jeeps. Really??? Come one, the whole movie is like that. One big joke. Scenery looks good however, but that is not enough to give it more that 3 stars.",vardown,7/9/13,2013
232,7,Worth a watch for Dom and Brian,"The movie is a fast paced action packed movie, as expected!Fast 5 ended with Letty being shown as alive, so obviously the curiosity was high regarding the suspense. The second thing to look forward to was the partnership between Dom and Hobbs.The suspense regarding Letty was nicely built up but probably ended up being weak in the end. Dom and Hobbs, together had a nice going with muscles and bashing all around. They find an able enemy in Klaus and Shaw.For me, the revelation of this movie was the chief villain Shaw, played by Luke Evans. He brings a certain arrogance, suave and menace, as expected from any villain who would be fighting against the likes of Dom. He does a good job. The movie has nice suspense in between and the end. It does go a little slow in between but that is a relief as it will gave u time to catch your breath amongst all the fast paced action with cars speeding and flying all around. The movie does not fail with the core of the movie, car racing! New cars, new stunts and new tactics. Some of the scenes, although, were blown out of proportion! Overall Justin Lin and Chris Morgan do good justice to the series.And yes! The movie does answer the question whether there'll be another one in the series. Go watch it for the answer, mine got ruined because of the social websites, go and watch it before someone spoils it for u (if it still hasn't happened already!)",ankitbahri,5/31/13,2013
236,6,Above average below expectations,"First after watching Fast Five I was very excited about the movie but sadly it did not live up to my expectations.

The first half is okay and offers nothing new. Some scenes are incredibly ruined by shaky cameras during the whole movie. The comic scenes and sound design is cool.

The tank scene is beautifully taken and Vin Diesel stunt is awesome and over the top.

The final chase scene is quite long and due to darkness it is completely wasted. No one cares when Gal Gadot dies!

Finally Jason Statham entry to the franchise is awesome move.

Overall the movie is watchable but not remember-able like Fast Five. Go with a very little expectations and you won't be disappointed for sure.",ravi_maniyar_2007,6/3/13,2013
239,8,Good but not the best,"We're at the sixth movie of the high speed franchise. Dom and his gang are recruited to capture mercenaries who want to create a weapon that will destroy the world. I might as well tell you guys how I feel about the other movies. The first one is good, I know it's a Point Break rip off but it still feels different kinda like Home Alone 2. The second one is good or decent, not bad, I can write one or two paragraphs on this but I won't bother. The third one is decent for sure and it's the worst. It's a spin off, not exactly a sequel and it easily could have a straight to DVD movie. I allowed myself to see it three times and I won't watch it again. The fourth one is good and it's the first true sequel because Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are in it, not just one of them. The fifth one is the best, it's a heist movie and Dwayne Johnson's character Luke Hobbs is introduced. Back to Fast Six, it's bigger than the previous movie but not better. The plot is thin, it's bloated and Hobbs is no longer an antagonist. Before the premise was announced, I thought Hobbs would still be chasing Dom and his gang and maybe they would be forced to work together again. Hobbs is still interesting, he doesn't have any boring conversations with Dom but their previous relationship was better. Who knows, maybe they will become antagonists later on. The action is good and yeah it's ridiculous. Dom is like a superhero and the Iron Giant just popped into my head. There's no shaky cam bullshit and there a lack of CGI. The villain is insane mercenary Owen Shaw played by Luke Evans. He is cliché but still threatening. He doesn't say why he wants to destroy the world, maybe he feels some destruction will help improve the world later on. Unlike the last villain, he doesn't sit around doing paperwork, he drives around and hurts a few people. He smiles during the tank scene which shows he's sadistic. This movie is lighthearted, it's not gritty like Fast Four or the Dark Knight trilogy or the upcoming Need For Speed movie which I'm looking forward to. There are some jokes and most of them work. I didn't write this review earlier because I didn't feel like writing any reviews and I recently decided I should write some reviews because I enjoy writing. Fast Seven will be coming out on April 2015 and only time will tell if Brian will get killed off. James Wan is the director, Justin Lin dropped out because he naturally wants to do other movies. I read James wants the action to be more realistic and I like that idea. I also like Jason Statham who is playing the villain and I read he doesn't want to destroy the world. Okay I'm done yapping.",ty-jensen,12/23/13,2013
241,3,Lame to say the least,"This film was properly lame, i only watched it because 21 and Over had been cancelled. I was astounded by how stupid some of the scenes are and some of the main parts of the storyline are 1: horrendous and 2: completely unrealistic and just plain stupid. If you want to watch a properly crap film then this is the film for you, and when the titles start rolling just run out of the cinema. The acting was pretty lame, and I am sick of seeing Dwayne Johnson in all of these sort of films. i haven't yet seen any of the previous Fast and Furious Films, but I do not plan on, judging by how bad this film was. i am quite glad that the next films in the series will have a new director, for humanities sake, I also think that a new cast, and crew, definitely a new writer, or even just cutting the films altogether would make a massive improvement!",edwardo-walsh,5/24/13,2013
243,7,Amazing furious,"Selection of Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson, and the line-up of actors from the previous films makes this film very impressive. Through this film, viewers were exposed to what actually happened to Letty in the fourth film (Fast & Furious). The film begins with the introduction of the cast with gazette from the previous Fast franchise playing in the background. This is very creative as viewers get a glimpse of the previous story lines. The car chasing scene between DK and Han on the road of Tokyo and 'Jason Statham' appearance at the end of this film is not only surprising to the audience but also provides clear picture of what's happening and creating exciting new plot for this movie sequel which is also the sequel to The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift.",murgy86,9/24/13,2013
245,10,Fast 6 & Extra Details,"Don't know if this is a spoiler but this is a Very good movie ! i've have been a fan of this movie since i was kid. I recommended you if you are first time watching this film, please watch, in order to understand the movie, and understand how the characters met.

1. The Fast and the Furious 2. 2 Fast 2 Furious 3. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift 4. Fast & Furious 4 5. Fast Five 6. Fast Six

When you finish watching fast 6, watch The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift again, to understand how the ending of fast 6 happen.

In my opinion, the film is setup like this

1. The Fast and the Furious 2. 2 Fast 2 Furious 4. Fast & Furious 4 5. Fast Five 6. Fast Six 3. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift 7. Fast Seven (In the making)

Since the first time I saw 'The Fast and The Furious' 12 years ago, I knew I found my car/mayhem fix. Although I never thought it would last to see iteration #6, I was more eager this time around than for the first. No surprises, besides the unpredictable nature of Owen Shaw. The only real curveball was the substantiation of an Internet rumor that Jason Statham joined 'Fast 6'. Well, sorta -- end credits. After the audience ""ooooohh's"" at Statham's revealing, I couldn't wait, yet again, for the 7th! Fun factoid: This movie marked the reuniting of 2 'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' characters. Jason Statham (Bacon) and Stephen Marcus (Nick the Greek) playing the CCTV supervisor opposite Lucas Hobbs. :)",Solarwinds78,5/31/13,2013
248,6,Finally feelings took over the muscles,"We all know up to now Fast & Furious has been one of the most successful movie franchises. I remember the time when I watched the first part of Fast & Furious. I really fell in love with this movie! I loved every single detail about it: story line, actors (that was when I knew about Vin Diesel and Paul Walker and got addicted to them), cars, but mostly car races. Then there was the second part of Fast & Furious that was not less interesting and exciting. I thought there wouldn't be any continuation, but deep inside hoped for that. And then, some years later, Universal Pictures announced the release of Fast & Furious 3, then 4, and 5. I was anxious to see those parts and loved them. But, frankly speaking, already starting with Fast & Furious 4 I was getting bored. There were less and less new things in the movie and it looked like this franchise started to be exhausted. With the release of the 5th part, honestly, I hoped it would be the end. But, as you know, this year we saw Fast & Furious 6.I admit, I expected too much from this part. I believed the director and producer would add some new things, new intrigues, but in reality everything was the same, just like in previous series. Here the story repeats again: in order to get freedom and clear his crew's criminal records Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) has to cooperate with the agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) to help him to take down a criminal organization led by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) and in which Dom's presumed-dead ex-girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is involved. Of course, there are fights with superman deeds (for example, when Dom saves Letty from falling out of the track), a bit of car races, shoot-outs, some humor scenes. Everything is just like in previous parts. But at the same time there are some attempts, unexpected though, to insert into the story line moral and human notions, such as love, feeling, freedom, betrayal, friendship. I can't say it worked. For me it looked a bit awkward. Imagine the scene where the fight is at its highest point and suddenly a jockstrap declares his love to the girl (the moment when Dom is talking to Letty when he finally meets her). And there are lots of such scenes. What I am trying to say is that for many people Fast & Furious is an action movie where people are not only used, but they require action, a lot of action. And now the director in order to prolong the existence of this franchise tries to turn it in some kind of soap opera by adding all this moral and emotional elements that don't match at all even with the characters. When you expect tough races and fights, but instead you get gentleness and tears – this is a bit confusing and disappointing and even boring.Well, my general opinion is that Fast & Furious has exhausted. It doesn't have anything new to suggest to its audience. Now, this movie is not about the cars and action, but about the morality. So, if you want to see a film full of fights and intrigues, you'd better chose something different. And I don't think the 7th part will be different, don't have any expectations from it. But we will see",eatakmakova,12/30/13,2013
251,1,Most overrated film since the Avengers,"Are you f u c k i n g kidding me? I guess this got positive reviews because compared to the other installments in the franchise, this one is like a masterpiece. But still absolutely ridiculously stupid & can barely be called a film.Not sure what we are supposed to take less seriously: Paul Walker's acting, Vin Deisel's monotone delivery, or that this is the 6th one of these pieces of garbage. Is this all Hollywood has to offer us these days? Reboots, remakes, and sequels? May as well continue the theme of making board games into major motion pictures because this is just absolutely horrendous. Fast and Furious is slowly becoming the Police Academy of our time.

255,8,Growing it shall,"(Fast and) Furious 6

(8/10) Entertainment is a small word for this..

I could safely say this is one of my favorites of the world-wide famous franchise, The All-Star Hollywood hit, managed to get the most talked about topic in town. (when in theaters), Big explosions, gun battles, negotiations. Just a classic Hollywood action movie.

No matter how much I loved the action in this film, there's one thing i'll miss a lot and maybe you'll agree, and that is the underground street racing we've seen in earlier films of the series. Really what the films are supposed to be about, but i'm not hating, I couldn't be more entertained, and I'm sure if you liked part 4 and 5, you'll absolutely love this one.

Haven't seen it yet? Go quickly!! and enjoy the epic open ending. A new movie star has joined the pack.

(about the franchise) I don't have to come up with a big story for this, but I love how finally fast and furious 3: Tokyo drift, got a linked with the other films, it felt so weird and wrong before this movie. Before it looked like it was, 1 and 2 together, 3 alone, and 4 and 5 together, now they suddenly all fit.

WORTH THE MONEY, You'll want this movie on DVD/Blu-ray into your collection.",texzhd,7/31/13,2013
256,6,Fast and Dubious 6,"Yeah, well... what can I say. I enjoyed the last Fast movie even with the ridiculous safe towing chase scene. But this one.... not so much.

It was still a fun ride, with all the characters doing their roles well, but I can't help think they tried too hard to top the last one. The focus was very much more on ""How ridiculous can we make it and not make people go Huh?"" The answer, unfortunately, was that they overcooked it a little.

The tank chase scene is enjoyable right up until the mid-air leap of faith that Dom performs with Letty. Then it was a ""Huh?"" moment. Mainly a ""Huh, why aren't they both suffering shattered bones?"" moment, in fact.

Later on, they indulged themselves ever more. The runway sequence went on for far, far too long. I don't mean that it was boring, just that there isn't a paved runway that long anywhere in the damn world! The bad guy drives onto the runway and, thirteen minutes and five seconds later, the chase concludes on the same runway. I'm going to be generous and say they were going only about fifty mph (the drama suggests far faster speeds). That gives a runway length of ten point something miles. Edwards Airforce base's longest runway is seven and a half miles long and it isn't paved. So where this foolishness is supposed to take place I have no idea.

I wouldn't mind, but the runway scene is blatantly overlong. Even knowing nothing about airports or the like, it leaves you wondering about it.

Character-wise, I get that Dom loved Letty and thought she was dead, so he moved on with the Brazilian chick, Elena. But character-wise, is it so hard to think he might find it just a little bit more difficult to dump Elena in favour of Letty again when he finds out she's still alive? I'd have been happier if his character had stayed with Elena. Letty had lost her memory, so she had nothing more than vague feelings to go on to tell her that he was anything special to her. A perfect opportunity to have things work out without making it the usual saccharin-fest, everything works out in the end type of deal that Hollywood is so fond of.

All this ending left me was feeling that Dom had shafted Elena (and not in the fun way, either!). No amount of ""She's okay with all this"" convinced me otherwise. It all smacks of ""Let's get Michelle Rodriguez back in the franchise 'cos it needs a boost."" followed by ""Wait! What about that other chick Dom was going out with at the end of the last movie?"" and then blank looks all around until ""We'll hand-wave their relationship away!"" Still, I suppose it was better than ""Let's kill her off to clear the way for Dom to get Letty back!"" All in all, though, a disappointment at several points. In between, it was fun and entertaining. However, it did leave a sense of dissatisfaction due to the nonsense scattered throughout.

Here's hoping they don't try and top the action in this one next time around.

It seems like even numbered Fast movies are not the best of the bunch.",Rob_Taylor,7/22/13,2013
257,8,Easily worth the price of admission,"Movie review:When I saw the first Fast and Furious, I very much enjoyed it for what it was. Racing action. That was it, no plot needed, although they put a cop in, blah blah. Well, the evolution of the Fast and Furious universe has changed dramatically.If you haven't seen the previous 5, it's OK, you will only miss out on some inside jokes, and character traits. The change it took was going from street racing to pro street racers performing high end heists (this occurred in the fifth installment) and now in 6 we have the culmination of all the characters that have appeared in the 5 others back for one last (?) big job. So, the crew is re-assembled by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, this time not for cash, but to stop a terrorist attack. This includes (not limited to) O'Connor (Paul Walker) and Toretto(Vin Diesel) who are the main players ever since the first one, O'Connor the ex-fbi agent now rogue, Toretto, the street criminal turned hero. OK, can't sum up the whole backstory so now the ""family"" has been reunited to stop the bad guy from stealing the final piece to creating a weapon capable of disabling the entire military infrastructure (they don't delve far into what/how exactly, just knocking out all communications). The mastermind behind this, Shaw (played very well by Luke Evans), is the one-step-ahead of everyone else criminal. Well, ultimately, Toretto wants nothing to do with it but there is a catch, a photo of Letty (thought to be dead Michelle Rodriguez) who was Torettos love and part of the family.So with this information, they decide with two goals in mind,save Letty and stop the attack, to take on this mission. One problem that occurs is Letty is now working for Shaw due to her memory loss after her attack as shown in flashbacks. OK, enough blabbering about plot, which there is more of it, and I dare you not to act surprised when several plot twists are revealed. Let's talk about action which there is plenty of. Keep in mind, checking things like physics and reality at the door are a must for these types of movies. The director (Justin Lin) does a superb job in choreography of the racing/car chase scenes which must be seen to be believed. Even though these scenes are impossible to fathom being possible, Lin films these scenes so precisely with every bit of attention to detail possible, edited together perfectly to inspire jaw dropping moments that may lead to disbelief and even clapping when you see them. No, really, it looks that good. Lin doesn't just stop there, he also utilizes his expertise in other action sequences including gun fights and also a very well filmed hand to hand fight. It plays out as a ""how to"" manual for making an action flick, especially a summer blockbuster (Domestic Total as of May. 27, 2013:$117,036,995 + $197,000,000 foreign). But a movie being strictly eye candy wouldn't be enough. A major step up that is present is the incredible on screen chemistry of the ""family."" Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous play off one another so well, giving us some of the biggest laughs and one liners of the movie. All the characters are played so well, you will be surprised at how you actually are drawn in to the depth they provide in between explosions. Not what you would expect to be another major selling point of this type of movie. The evolution of this franchise now has taken the old die hard fans of the straight up racing from the earlier movies and brought in a whole new group of fans by introducing more of the action elements and complex (for action) stories that are not just fluff. At the end of the 2 hours, I believe you will leave this movie experience extremely satisfied with all aspects of this film, and also do to a major cliffhanger (don't stand up the second the credits start, trust me) that will leave you anxiously awaiting Fast and Furious 7, which I believe will be the final one (do not hold me to that unless I am right). Do yourself a favor and see this one in the theater. 8.0/10 IMDb 7.8 OK, I can't stop there without saying one thing that Heather and I could not hold back laughing about, no spoiler but the ""check reality"" thing is so in focus in one scene it is really stupid, luckily it is surrounded by tons of action, but the runway a plane takes off from has to be somewhere around 500-700 miles long to accommodate the scene. That is all I will say, you will know what we mean when you see it. Thanks for going to the movie with me, Heather, those who read this (including you) know I 99% of the time watch movies at home, so it was a nice change of pace.

260,7,Think 'Ocean's Eleven' on Red Bull,"I used to scoff at this franchise. ""It's just 2 hours of souped-up Hondas and rap music."" I said, feeling rather smug. But a funny thing happened. They tweaked the formula, and suddenly a franchise of over-glorified music videos became entertaining popcorn flicks. No, the plots aren't great, the dialog is cliché and the acting won't win any awards (unless you count The Razzies), but I can't recall having more fun watching a straight-up action movie in a long, long time. A lot of it doesn't make any sense if you think about it too hard, but then again it's a Summer action movie. You're not SUPPOSED to think too hard. My advice; Buckle-up and enjoy.

261,1,This sucked,"This was by far the worst of the series. Fast and Furious used to be films about car people for car people now it's just another brainless action film for brainless viewers.

It's become too mainstream and that has ruined it for the people that matter- their core audience. It actually makes me sad how ridiculous this film is, I don't know where to start the Escort jump, the explosions, the tank, and don't even get me started on the runway.

There was one street race and that included a ridiculous wheelie and some impossible cornering. Why do they also think that changing gear immediately makes you faster?

Seriously, if you are a mindless sheep you will enjoy this film but if you were hoping for a proper fast and furious film you will be seriously disappointed.",al-742-113866,7/19/13,2013
262,7,"Good fun, as far as you don't compare it to Fast Five","After having watched the trailer to the new addition in this exciting, edge of the seat action, it immediately went on my list of 'Must watch' titles. 2013 had a lot of interesting films coming out, but after the post credit scene of Fast Five, which according to me was the perfect action film that would appeal to almost everyone, with its great cast, heart pumping car races and solid plot, I obviously had big expectations for this one...But having said that, the first half of the film was a bit of a let down. I understand that they wanted to re-establish the characters, and try and emphasize on the concept of 'we don't turn our backs on family', but I'm not sure that's what audience usually expect in the Fast and Furious franchise. And the villain gang, despite it's potential, weren't established properly, and we didn't get much of a chance to create an opinion on them. With the slight disappointment of the first half, there came the second, which made up for all the lack of cars and speed up until that point. And it was completely worth it. Here, I can say that the trailer didn't show all the best parts, and there was way more to 'They got a tank' and the super cool scene with the car bursting out from the plane. As far as the cast goes, Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson were great playing their tough guy roles and they did fairly succeed in their attempt to match the Dom-Hobbs face off from the predecessor. Michelle Rodriguez reminded us what we felt was missing in the series after she was assumed dead. All in all, it was good fun, and does prove to be entertaining despite it's flaws; as far as you don't compare it to its predecessor. And watch out, for this one has a surprise ending as well, and you will not be disappointed (This time placed before the entire end credits, so you shouldn't miss it, like you probably did in Fast Five...not unlike me)",sanjna-polamarasetty,6/9/13,2013
263,6,Same movie over and over again,"This is the sixth installment in the Fast and the Furious franchise, so fastened your seats and enjoy this 2 hour and 10 minute thrill ride that has real movie car chases at top speeds, real movie stunts and join Toretto and his gang as they go on a high stakes adventure through Picadilly Circus, Moscow, the Canary Islands, Tokyo and Hong Kong. There's British guy who wants to buy their old-fashioned garage car business while their in England and Russian villain who doesn't want them to have a happy ending. The cast includes Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Chris Ludarcis Bridges, Dwayne the Rock Johnson, Tyrese Gibson, Michelle Rodgrieuz, and Sung Kang. The film feels rushed but that's alright by me, it's supposed to feel rushed and fast. I really enjoyed this movie, you got supercops and supercriminals going way over their heads and keeping it cool and straight and out of the jailbox. The cinematography and camera-work is outstanding and the sound effects are vroom. This is even better than ""Fast Five"" and better than that movie ""Erased"" that I saw on On Demand. What I learned about this movie is that if you trash a old-fashioned car and you could always put it back together again or fix it with the powerful mechanics and tools we have today.",jpc8024-956-993529,5/28/13,2013
264,8,From guilty pleasure to quality heist film!,"I had kinda given up on these movies after 2 Fast, 2 Furious, skipping Tokyo Drift.. When Fast Five came out i had SO many people at work telling me ""oh it was awesome"" and with all the buzz Fast 6 was getting, i splurged on the Best Buy 10 buck deal and picked up Fast 4 and 5 and watched them... They were entertaining...

Fast 6, though, really does take it to a whole new level. The action and stunt choreography were incredible, the twist of who the mole was in Hobbes' team was a legit surprise, and Giselle's death really caught me off-guard and struck me emotionally.

You knew Han had to die eventually (he had become my favourite character in the 3 films), and i think i might actually go back to watch Tokyo Drift just to see the end of his character properly.

I have never seen a movie pull from all previous movies to make up it's opening credits! Having all the old crew mixed with the new crew from Fast 5 is what put this movie over the top for me! I honestly CANNOT wait until Fast 7 next year! If this one is any indication, it will NOT disappoint. I highly recommend catching this one in theaters. It will be awesome on DVD, but the full effect of the movie can only be had on the big screen!!! Will definitely be buying this the day it is released to DVD!

I won't say much about it, you should go for it. Though it is a one time watch, but it is worth every penny and the time that you will spend on it. The bottom line, You won't be disappointed after watching this movie. This movie has done justice to the series and the expectations. And don't walk out of the theater as soon as you see the credits coming, because there is a BIG and i mean BIIIIIIIGGG surprise coming.

269,6,Fast & Furious 6,"Fast & Furious 6 stars Vin Diesel (The Chronicles of Riddick), Dwayne Johnson (G.I. Joe: Retaliation), and Paul Walker (Fast & Furious).

In this one, Agent Hobbs (Johnson) recruits Dominic Torreto (Diesel) and his gang to help track down a criminal named Owen Shaw, played by Luke Evans (The Raven). Shaw specializes in ""vehicular warfare"". Obviously, there would be none better to handle the case than the Fast and Furious crew.

If you are a fan of this series, then surely you have come to expect the cheesy lines, bad acting, and far-fetched, if not, impossible, action sequences. These are the main reasons why I myself am not a fan. Without giving away too much, I do feel the need to mention a scene that takes place on a runway. After a while, I thought, this runway has to be about 30 miles long in order to accomplish all that is taking place. It was laughable.

Okay, now that I have that out of my system, I'll try to focus on the positives.

The cars are awesome and there are some exciting chase scenes, big stunts, and some decent action and fight sequences. There is also some good comic relief, most of which came from the characters played by Tyrese Gibson (Four Brothers) and Ludicrous (2 Fast 2 Furious). I thought that Luke Evans, by far, gave the best performance in the movie --- and come on, who doesn't like to see Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson kick some ass?

Look, the fans of this series will love this movie and I think it's going to be a big box office hit. One other thing, be sure to stick around for the credits. You'll be glad you did.

My grade for this film: C

270,5,"They started out defying traffic laws, now they defy gravity laws.","It is not good but nor is it bad. Fast and Furious 6 is a bit above average movies that was flawed. I found the story predicable and cliché. It was pretty much unoriginal from a person having amnesia to a person who betrays the groups. Also, too much was going on and after one thing got fixed more problems came in when it should of just ended at that point. It is also really stupid when the villain is right in front of your eyes who you are trying to capture and yet you let him go and wait another time for the real deal. The story is not as clean as the last one but is it far better than the earlier movies of this franchise. I also found the dialogue ridiculous and unnecessary and kept on face palming each time they add a line. As for the positives, obviously the action scenes were awesome especially the plane scene at the end. Also, make sure to stay after the credits, it will give you clues to what F&F7 is going to be and possible villain for 7. Overall, Fast and Furious 6 is a mediocre movie that is worth a one time watch. Nothing really special but if someone wants some action this is the movie to watch. Not the best so far this summer but neither is it the worst. Fast Five will remain the best of the series.",gee_lok,5/18/13,2013
271,6,London Baby!,"Who would have thought back in 2001 that The Fast and the Furious would somehow because a movie series that would last to six movies with a seventh on the way? Even more surprising the Fast and Furious series has become of the premier action series and being one of Universal Studios' biggest cashcows.After the Rio heist all of Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew have gone their separate ways and now multi-millionaires. But despite longing for a quiet life they are brought back into action when Diplomatic Security Service Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) gets the crew to help him stop a former British SAS officer turned mercenary Owen Shaw (Luke Shaw) who has been target military convoys in Europe to make a tech bomb. Hobbs has a big incentive for Toretto to go back into action by having proof his girlfriend and long-time love Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) is still alive and working for Shaw. With the crew in London car chases and fighting eschews.The appeal of The Fast and Furious films since Justin Lin has taken over the direction of the series has been his championing of practical effects. Whilst there is some CGI (which isn't particularly good) Fast 6 is still a feat of stunt work, fight sequences and in camera effects. Lin does know how to direct an action sequences, giving us an excellent car chase in London, the tank chase in its full ridiculousness and the final sequence involving a military transport plane (even if it takes place on the world's longest runway). Gina Carano and Joe Taslim from Haywire and The Raid were both added to the cast, bringing their fighting talents to the series and they are fine additions. Taslim has an excellent fight with Tyrese Gibson and Sung Kang in Waterloo Station (though it wasn't really filmed in Waterloo Station). I was disappointed by the fight between Carano and Rodriguez but that is because of the fight was shown in the trailers and it was intercut to much with the Taslim fight.Fast and Furious 6 has a massive cast with some members getting more attention then others. The big winners were Diesel and Johnson; both are massive screen presence with charisma and have the action chops. Johnson steals the shows once again, being a mass of muscle with one-liners and plenty of action ability: it is impressive the casting director was able to find a man bigger then The Rock so the pair could fight. Walker is his usual bland self and Joanna Bowster gets the shaft again, this time holding the baby. Carano is a woman of action and little words and Gibson is the comic relief to the point he was a bit annoying.A problem with the series has been the villains have been lacklustre. Evans is a man who is servable in the role and he is the best villain so far simply because he does feel more of a threat because he is a man of action himself, getting involved in the frontline, being a driver and a skilled martial artist: it is better then a middle aged crime lord with a load of heavies. But Fast 7 will have a better a villain with the post credit scene setting up the sequel.Whilst the action seemed like a step up from the Fast Five, the story is so much sillier. The Fast and Furious series has never been know for being strong storytelling but at least with Fast Five it felt a believable that these characters would attempt a massive heist, but Fast and Furious 6 was much more of a stretch just to reunite the team and get them working with Hobbs who has quickly become a fans favourite. The crew has shown to be expert investigators suddenly. We have American characters going round the more seedy side of London; they would be very noticeable very quickly. And as a Brit I do take it personally when the film used outdated stereotypes of British people like the snotty salesman.Like Fast Five, Fast and Furious 6 is long and baggy, but this problem felt more prominent as the film tried to give anyone a moment to shine and there were sequences that could have been cut. One example is when O'Conner goes undercover in a prison in Los Angeles which was just a plot cul-de-sac and reference more to Fast and Furious (which was a forgettable entry). It needed a re-write to just tighten thinks up because the running time could have been under two hours. Fast and Furious 6 is surprising convoluted for what is supposed to be a simple action flick.Funs of the series with be very satisfied with the sixth entry and on an action level it is solid. It is good to see practical effects in an action film. But it mindless and silly and it unlikely to appeal to detectors. Still the seventh film should be interesting just because of the villain.",freemantle_uk,5/31/13,2013

276,8,This movie is the best yet.,"I loved this movie great action scenes and amazing on screen chemistry between the whole cast. In my opinion this is the best Fast and Furious yet. I was on the edge of my seat for almost the whole movie and in tears for a couple of parts. I cannot wait for the Seventh installment to this franchise. I'm a huge fan of this franchise and the way it keeps you guessing time after time. Vin Diesel plays this character to a T and has since the beginning , Michele Rodriguez is absolutely brilliant in this film she is as good as it gets when it comes to female action hero's and shows it off several times in this film. The seventh installment in this franchise is going to be great based on the small snippet show in the credits of this film.",sidrah-harcourt,9/4/13,2013
277,10,"Leave your brain at home and ENJOY THE RIDE, 'cause you will!","Im giving this one 9 out of 10! Why, you ask?The Fast and the furious franchise are well-known for their amazing action sequences. Not for their average script or kind-of-okay acting. THEY GIVE WHAT THEY PROMISE YOU!The Acting: It was okay! They really didn't need to express many emotions, besides Angry, happy, sad and... ready-to-race-ish. The actors did their job well enough. 7/10 for the actingThe story/script: The story didn't have many layers. There are some plot twists you might not expect. But you don't expect them because you probably don't care enough about the characters involved in the twists. 7/10 for the story. They did tie up the third and the fourth to this one, which I think was a pleasant surprise though.The scenery: They chose some amazing places to shot at! London, Spain, a little bit of their old house back in the USA. The movie was very well filmed! 9/10The action sequences: Wow! Amazing! The list of actors contained THE ROCK, Vin freaking diesel, but you won't find ""Mr. Gravity"" in there! They were great shot, amazing performed and the CGI was very well used. I could not have wished for better action scenes! 10/10 for sure!#tank #plane #therock #awesomeComedy: Their was some comedic relief and It actually didn't feel forced at all. It worked very well!In general: This movie delivers exactly what you're hoping for! I would pay to see it again on the big screen! 9/10 FOR SURE! Go see it as Fast as you can!P.s.: Wait till the post credit scene! It will satisfy the fans and excite the audience in general!",gangstah_vino,5/25/13,2013
278,2,The plot gets thick,"By the time you see Han and his girl say that line about next is tokyo, you know it's going to roll back to the beginning of Tokyo drift, and because Han was alone in the movie, so obviously the girl friend die in this tragecly poor plot sequel of F&F.And then you realize Han's death was not of accident but murdered by mr. transporter here from out of nowhere... THIS IS HILOURISLY STUPID! I don't think I would care more about this franchise ... what an insult. Letty's pathetic survival was by all mean has no logic in it. This is cheesier than any soap opera I've seen all my life.Thank you so much to bring a period to this awesome series to trash and please put more trash cans into the next one if your intention is to praise trash anyway! still 1 star given to awesome action sequence",mixacase,9/2/13,2013
280,10,"Just one word, Breathless!","This is ""THE"" Movie. I am a big fan of the franchise and hence also the biggest critic of the series.

Let me explain, what i meant by saying that it is ""The"" movie, was that this titles redeems all the shortcomings and complains i had from previous titles.From the beginning to the end i was drawn into the universe of ""Dom Toretto"". As the story progressed i was completely mesmerised by the characters and the scenes.

Justin Lin is my new hero he made me remember what was it like watching John woo in my teens. Thank You. For making me remember what it felt like, to be the Kid in the movie ""Last Action Hero"".

The magic of Hollywood truly shines in this title, there is a trend of CGI (computer generated graphic's)dominating the movies in some titles, this one particularly justifies each and every one of them without making you feel that the CGI was intended to carry the movie. Even with all the action, the undercurrent of ""emotion"" is what i truly enjoyed, the way Dom feels about the Family, or how the equation between him and Hobb's has evolved over time, was simply brilliantly showcased. It was like in the 2002 movie ""Big Fat Liar"" the climax had a dialogue by actor John Cho, ""I told you Marty,the only way to shoot this scene was from seven different angles, on the rooftop"". And it applies truly to this whole epic. From Dwayne Johnson to all the cast this was one brilliant performance. the score in itself was subtly and yet in a adrenaline rising way suited the movie in true spirit without overshadowing the scenes themselves, it never felt out of place rather it enhanced the whole experience to a whole new level. And this something coming from a guy who loves blues over heavy metal.

Watch this without any disturbance, or better put; causing hindrance to this movie's showcase should be made an criminal offence.",killferd,9/21/13,2013
281,8,Not as bad as you people think.,"I almost laugh at commenters who give this movie 1 Star. One person referred to people as ""morons"", one said that having a seemingly dead character dead wasn't original, and another didn't even see 3,4,5. Went to go see the movie last night and it seemed to be much better than 5 in my opinion.

Similar to Fast 5, The Team(Diesel, Walker, Luda, Gibson, Kang, Gadot, and Rock) is back, excluding the other two guys. While amnesia is not the most clever and original idea out there, it is not something seen in most films and gives writers a reason for Diesel to take the job. If it were any other criminal, Diesel would probably refuse. The amount of destruction, the customized drag racing cars, the fights, it just goes to show how much The Fast series has evolved.

Fast 5 did have the rest of the cast helping out in the mission, but it was just some small stuff. Undercover work, opening safe, helping during the chase. Really, the everyone else wasn't that significant to the mission. This time, EVERYONE has a major part in this. You have Gadot with gun, Kang and Gibson get their ***es whooped and help more during the tank chase, Rocky is seen beside Diesel, and then there's Ludicrous standing on the sidelines. The members of the team seem more important this time around.

What some people do complain about, and I understand, is that this movie is less about Fast Driving and more about fighting. I get it; its easy to feel this way. While very slightly sad about that, 6 seems to have much more comedy and humoric jokes. They might mostly revolve around Tyrese Gibson, but nonetheless the jokes are still funny. Taking snacks out of the vending machine, foul mouth during the tank scene, the grappling hook, BIG FOREHEAD. So while less about the fast street racing like in the original, it has added a few more jokes and fighting which isn't that much worse.

What does impress me most is the progression of the Fast Movies. First the main ant was an Asian gang with Uzi's and motorcycles. 2 was a white guy with 2 Spanish henchmen, 3 was a Japanese teenager, 4 was(I actually never fully saw 4. lol), 5 was a corrupt Spanish police force, and this time involved guys from the same breed. As mentioned, these are not cops, these are the best criminals in Europe; they are fast and deadly. They have their own set of custom cars that are faster to begin with and have ramps on their hood. They have advanced and modified weapons like the chips. Last importantly, ""They Got a Tank"". The series went from something as small and minor as guys on motorcycles to extreme drivers with a tank and drag cars.

I do honestly enjoy this movie much more than 5, though watching this in a theater did hurt my eyes from all of the explosions and bright lights. The engagement of supporting characters is a good feature for the first time also, along with the twist near end. Can't wait until this comes out on DVD",mbh42498,6/15/13,2013

283,10,This is how fun movies should be,"The Fast and Furious movies are never going to be Oscar darlings but when you pay your money at the movie theater to see them you know what you're going to get and they deliver it for you. Not only are the F&F movies fun and great popcorn entertainment they don't insult your intelligence like the Transformers or Battleship type blockbusters do.Vin Diesel and Paul Walker have great chemistry together as the leads for the series. Great to see one of the original 4 characters of Michelle Rodriguez back in the fold. Her lack of presence was missing in Fast Five. Don't get me wrong Fast Five was a great movie even without her but the Brian, Dom, Mia and Letty characters make it feel like a true F&F movie. Without one of the 4 main characters it takes away from the F&F feel of the movie. That's probably why Tokyo Drift was the weakest of all the F&F movies.",Maniac-9,5/28/13,2013
284,10,They get better as they come! On to number 7!,"I am a massive fan on the fast and furious films. I love them all. The first, second, third, fourth and fifth! But this sixth film... This was definitely something else. I went to the cinema to see this. It wasn't sold out but the screen was packed with people! The film was bone chilling from the very start. Literally just sat on the edge of your seat. Nail biting.. Always wondering what type of brilliant action would you get next!Once the film had finished. I was completely blown away it was that amazing! So much better than the fifth one! Even though we looked like idiots because we were the only ones who did it, me and my dad stood up after and clapped! I'd say we were both happy to spend our money to see this!Everyone who is in this film pulls off their role as a character so brilliantly! Vin diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodrigez and all of the others! If I had a cold beer in my hand I would raise my glass to the cast of this unbelievably brilliant film!I really do recommend this to anyone who is a big fan of the fast and furious series.. Take it from a guy with experience who has been there and done that. You will be blown away by it all. The cars, the action, the storyline and even the tank.Lets all raise our glasses to Fast and Furious 7 which is released sometime next year in 2014! Can't wait for it. Absolutely buzzing!!",ferrarirocks,5/30/13,2013
285,8,Love these movies,"Fast and Furious won't let you down. Even it is a 6th installment on this series it still rocks. Movie is turbo loaded popcorn entertainmet loaded with testosteroine and smell of gas. The story isn't the brightest, but that can easilly forgive because this movie is exactly what you are waiting for. Movie is full of great action scenes which are so exaggeration that you can only laugh for them. Thankfully movie doesn't take itself too seriously, you understand that at the latest when Dwayne Johnson is to be called as a sumerian Thor. With the previous movie I was hoping that next movie get it's bad guy from Jason Statham. It didn't became truth in this movie, but the end scene promises that Jason Statham will be the bad guy in next installment. Can't wait to see that. Leave your brains to cloakroom and enjoy great entertainment.",tinovalkki,7/4/13,2013
286,5,A lost opportunity.,"The movie was big. It had a large scale. It had good actors and a big budget. But poor direction and bad story left it as a more than disappointing experience. The director seems to not have even the basic grasp of elementary physics. My woes arise from the many lost opportunities. There are many movies out there which have a shitty storyline, but great action to make up for it (Die Hard 5 comes to mind). But this couldn't even achieve that. The action choreography seemed to have been done by a child playing with action figures. The movie is plagued with bad dialogues and stupid attempts at comedy. Frankly, the only thing positive about the movie is the cast. Overall, it is not worth your money.",Krennex,5/25/13,2013
287,10,A Scoop of Awesome with sprinkles of greatness! A topping of delicious action packed goodness!,"I was surprised by the low reviews and so much trash talk about the film. I am so HAPPY that the entire cast from Fast 5 is in the movie. Film makers and Directors don't understand how important it is for the characters to remain the same, yet grow on screen. I am LOVING how the introduced the plot- which is another Job. Not to mention sexy sexy sexy cast! I'm only 16 minutes in, but I am LOVING, LOVING, LOVING IT!! The adversary in this movie is sure to leave you hanging on the edge of your seats, while I am getting some hint of the first Batman remake with Heath Ledger, by some of the cars and stunts. This ""bad guy"" in the movie is giving the Guys of Fast & the Furious a run for their money!",jsphillips831,6/18/13,2013

289,8,Exceptional Movie With One Anachronism,"This movie revealed a powerful sequel to the 5th in the series. With the classic car chases, incredible action sequences, and explosive ending there was more than enough entertainment to sate even the most ardent movie goer. The quality and quantity covered within the movie revealed rekindled relationships, further deepened intimacies, and unexpected deaths. The movie managed to keep the franchise on track in terms of both accuracy and success. This movie was a splendid creation that is a true testament to the art of mobile action. The one anachronism that I noticed, but not pinpointed by How It Should of Ended, was the scene in the preliminary car chase where the bad guys simply fired gadgets onto their pursuers' cars, which in effect, detonated a blow out of one of the car's tires. The question, why not replace this gun with a more powerful explosive. Just something to think about.",hdalby33,8/25/13,2013
290,4,"Action-filled, badly scripted, probably enough to entertain a child...","At first I thought it could be fun, otherwise why would they make a 6th movie? I even checked the reviews on this site, it had a fair amount of critical acclaim, so I thought - why not?

It wasn't until characters like Vin Diesel and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson started speaking their lines, that I realized how poorly written the film was... I'm surprised IMDb have even bothered to add ""memorable quotes"" because there aren't any. I would have expected a better script from a children's film, it was so clich� - but that was probably to be expected.

Don't get me started on how unrealistic some of the scenes were, the most surprising was the final runway scene, where the plane kept on going for 15 minutes, surely the runway would've ended? But you probably saw enough of that in the trailer.

Overall, the film had a good production value, some of the backdrops were impressive and quite well directed, but if I were the director, I wouldn't want to be seen on set with some of that acting.

I would only watch for the action scenes which are clich� but still pretty impressive.

291,8,A guilty pleasure.,"Everyone has something they enjoy that they really shouldn't. Lance had drugs, Tiger had women who weren't his wife and I have the F&F franchise. Thankfully my guilty pleasure won't get me into trouble, just weird looks from those who know I have zero interest in cars in real life. But that's the joy of this series: it's a souped-up fantasy with no interest in being grounded. With physics, common sense and realism all gleefully thrown out of the window, returning director Justin Lin concocts an awesome array of ludicrous vehicular set-pieces and bone- crunching fights, accompanied with tongue-in-cheek humour and amusing references to past Fast flicks. The cast know they are on a good wicket with this seemingly invincible franchise and are clearly having a blast. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker lap up the opportunity to play their most popular roles once again, Michelle Rodriguez is back in the part that made her big, Gina Carano and Luke Evans get in on the fun, whilst Dwayne ""Samoan Thor"" Johnson again commands your undivided attention as law enforcer Hobbs. If these movies aren't your thing then this sixth instalment won't change that, but if you're already a fan then you'll be in a supercharged, nitrous-oxide-injected heaven.",Troy_Campbell,6/6/13,2013
292,10,My favorite movie franchise,"The F-N-F crew has struck GOLD again yet again. Man, as long as you guys keeping making these movies, I will be paying to see them, and waiting on the Blue-Ray to drop. And a lot of sequels, they don't get better, they don't get it right on the second, to even get a chance for a third, but yours do. And adding more fire power as your franchise grows is an awesome touch for then fan base! The Rock was an awesome addition. Vin and Paul, keep up the great work.... And Paul, I'm a Nissan guy too, so seeing the GTRs and those 240sx pop up time after time is all the better. Vin you need to switch from the Mopor man, LOL. F-N-F, you have a true fan for life. ""Ride Or Die""!!!",tjbroaden,5/26/13,2013
293,10,Loved it!,"As great as the original Fast & Furious! High adrenaline and fast cars. Who would have guessed they would have put so much time into the storyline along with the time they put in these actor's appearances. It is a great movie for those adults & young adults who have grown up with these movies. Due to the fighting and drug cartel references not a great movie for kids. This is a movie you would want to leave the kiddos home with a babysitter as you enjoy it. Upbeat, high energy, and will leave you smiling! This is a great movie to watch with the full impact of the movie theater experience. An absolute must see! Never a dull moment!",Groovercare,6/9/13,2013
294,1,Movie was terrible. Don't waste your money.,"Horrible movie. The action sequences were weak and unbelievably bad. The acting was some of the worst I have ever seen and don't even get me started on the generic repetitive storyline. Even for an action movie, this was incredibly boring. They have been milking this series so long that it's barely lactating. Please, do yourself a favor and don't watch this piece of trash movie. Only good part was after the credits.The dialogue suffers from generic lines spat out from other movies and the plot armor on the characters is so obvious that there's no tension because you already know which can and can't die. The series is so afraid of losing one of the main characters that they make all the effort to revive them just to please the crowd that is obsessed with that specific character. So many of the scenes are just unbelievably bad and ignore every single law of physics. While watching the movie, I was hoping time would speed up because there was literally nothing to look forward to in this movie. The plot didn't get better throughout the movie and felt very stale. Slow progression and overall too long.",Zetram,6/8/13,2013
295,9,Brilliant!,"You would think that the plot for the Fast and Furies series would start to run out of gas and slowly die out,as all the characters ""retired"" after the job on Fast Five. But in Fast and Furious 6 We find Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), and the rest of the gang, all of who have retired from active duty to live lives of sumptuous ease, being called back by law enforcers (Dwayne Johnson and Gina Carano) and put to straight work.

Their task is to take out the another ""gang"" this one run by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). Toretto is particularly interested in this job as he find out his ex wife Letty(Michelle Rodriguez) who he thought was dead is part of this gang and still alive, and feels a desperate urge to find her and bring her back to the family. The film takes us through many set pieces and jaw dropping scenes and a few massive plot twists. One for example, is when Han (Sung Kang) is holding Gisele Yashar(Gal Gadot) hand as she clings for her life off a levitating car due to them trying to take out the engine, she lets go of his hand and open fires on one of Shaw's men standing behind Han, ready to kill him, if not for her sacrifice to save Han and fall to her death... rather than to see Han killed before her very eyes. The stunts performed were top notch, The acting, well that really surprised me i hadn't been too impressed with the acting in the previous Fast Five or other F&F films but this time round they nailed it, couldn't really fault them.

The ending leads us back to Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift where Han is killed in a car crash, but this time Ian Shaw (Owen Shaw's brother) played by Jason Statham exits a white car and makes a phone call saying "" Dominic Toretto, you don't know me, but you soon will."" So this makes lets us know that Fast and Furious 7 will have another big name actor- Jason Statham brought into the film series.",NicholasMilne,6/5/13,2013
296,10,Good movie,"
This is probably one of the best movie's in the Fast and the Furious franchise. It took a long time for it all to lead to Tokyo Drift and we finally find out what the ending of Tokyo drift was all about through this movie, Han goes to Tokyo. While most franchises lose their steam with each succeeding sequel, the Fast and the Furious franchise is that rare exception where its later films breathe in new life into the series.The cast seems to sleepwalk through the production with only the occasional chase or explosion or plane crash to jar the audience out of its stupor. And speaking of aeroplanes, the concluding sequence - which features a Russian cargo jet lumbering for takeoff with cars and the entire cast either hanging from it or chasing it - goes on so long the runway has to be at least 50 miles long. In conclusion, this movie was good, bye.",russell-360,9/4/13,2013
297,8,Pedal To The Metal!,"Hell yeah!! Now this is the movie to go see in theaters!! Hearing those loud car engines roaring,screaming, and rushing makes my ears tickle in excitement!! The cars are sexy and the Toretto family is still kicking in gear in a another action pack adrenaline rush manhunt.You think the movie will start off slow but, oh no it cuts right to the chase to not leave the viewer bored. Not only its filled with action ,but good humor as well. Especially, Roman who kept the audience filled with laughter mostly every scene he is in. I loved how The Rock simply kicks so much ass even when he is standing still giving orders. Very glad to see he is in the pack again. A great character to the franchise. Vin Diesel is still the same old Vin we all knew from the previous Fast and The Furious movies ,but pairs up with The Rock which makes it even better.Very good movie you wouldn't want to miss in theaters. Also extra ending at the end of the movie will blow you away!!",SuperRev9,5/27/13,2013
298,3,"Predictable, hackneyed, clichéd and canned","I was going to give this an honest 5, but when I saw how many people were giving it outrageously high ratings (7 for instance), I had to throw what little weight I have as a single reviewer against the sandbaggers. 7.8? If this hits 8.0 it's in the same class as Mystic River or Papillon.

Who didn't know there was a double agent within the first half hour? Who didn't know Letty would shoot Dom? Were you really surprised when Shaw kidnapped Brian's wife? And Vin... learn how to do something other than mumble slowly and darkly. I guess that's the director's fault, not yours, but still.

The action was all right in this film, but it mattered less to me because I knew how it would work out all along. The only thing that surprised me was when they killed off Gisele and (apparently) Han, the only two characters who seemed the least bit real. Guess they were getting too soft on account of L-O-V-E. Can't have that.

The good things I wish to say: Dwayne was fun if not funny (no one was funny). Tearing up the interrogation room was as unbelievable as everything else in the movie, but it was entertaining to see him spoof his rasslin' career. Um... that's it.",platonicbomb,5/28/13,2013
299,9,First time seeing any in series,"I had never seen any of the Fast and Furious movies and I say this one by mistake, and I am glad I did. I believe they did a good job at explain the back story for first time watchers. Will defiantly be watching the other 5! For me there was a little to much unrealistic parts but I believe that is what happens with any high budget action movie. Like I said this was my first Fast and Furious movie so I am not sure if every actor has been in every movie but I believe you can truly tell that they have an almost family like bond between the cast and even the crew. I believe that, the fact that they have this relationship with each other truly adds to the movie. Now I could be 100% wrong and they could just all hate each other and be great actors.",sweetcocoman,7/11/13,2013
301,8,Best Fast ever made.,"This was certainly best movie in Fast And The Furious series. Best in all 6 movies. Like always movie goes on series of events, whose solution could only be fast cars and action. Laws of physics do not apply to Fast Movies, because following laws of physics is something Hollywood has given responsibility to Christopher Nolan. So trailers made me to go watch this movie on first day and it was certainly the best idea. It was more fun that any of fast movie. Great mix of comedy, action, romance too. An extraordinary villain was present here, who was undoubtedly best among all the villains we have seen before in this series. Making money and steeling was not the focus, but something else was at the stake. So watching criminals work with the police, this was just amazing. Dwayne Johnson, The Rock again rocks the action scenes with his never ending style. Best Fast movie ever Made.",amitsingh2783,5/23/13,2013
302,10,Awesome movie!!!!!!!,"I don't know why people are bitching about direction of movie is bad. This movie franchise is all about cars and crazy stunts and well ya about cars. f**k the story story is secondary when we watch this fast and furious series it's all about gorgeous racing cars.. You want story go watch pearl seven borne. You don't go for story when you watch Stepup franchise all you care is freaking dance.. so to the people who did't like this movie you did't see what actually the director wanted you to look.If the movie had story primary then people would be bitching about ""there weren't enough cars in there franchise forgot what this series is all about"".get over it.

Bring On FAST 7....",shahsamir-96,5/18/13,2013
305,2,Complete and utter rubbish.,"Believability of this movie is on par with XXX (Triple X). As someone already said, there is unnecessary fight between allies that no one else but them sees. The part where Vin catapults himself out of his car to catch his girlfriend is... well.. I was pretty certain such scenes died out from movies ten years ago, but no. The movie is insult to intelligence. I came to check it on IMDb expecting to see not more than 4, and finding the people value it 7.4 is just another proof you quite often can't believe IMDb rates, both high and low. Watch it with your kids if you must, but be prepared for some royal punching in your believability synapses.",tompaxy,7/11/13,2013
309,1,I have no idea how it has reviewed well,"Literally the worst film I have ever seen, maybe barring Knight & Day. The ""action"" is ridiculously overdone and cringeworthy at times. Especially when Vin Diesel jumps 20 feet through the air to catch a person while being shot at by a tank, over a bridge, tackles her mid air and lands on a car. Many other moments in this film that had me laughing about how bad and ridiculous it actually was. Once more, the worst film I have ever seen. Although it is so bad, it's comical. Mindless entertainment. Would not recommend it to anyone, unless I know that they enjoy moronic films. I really cannot believe the reviews of this film have been as good as they are, absolutely ridiculous. Considering the Rock was a professional wrestler, he is probably the best actor in it and Jason Statham coming into it makes me want to never go to the cinema again, another awful over rated actor who optimises moronic films.",milburn_369,6/25/13,2013
313,2,One of the worst movies. Ever.,"Plain horrible. Why? Let me recap...the bad guys are asked to help the cops to get another bunch of bad guys. These are the worst and they got all two cops on it - yes you guessed it - Dwayne Johnson is one of them. Not sure how they got into the UK if Interpol was looking for them, incredible jumps through the air without scratches, 30 miles long runway and other fictional attributes in this one. If this was classified as sci-fi and was happening in another universe with a different laws, I'd happily enjoy it.

Full of clich�s that were just horribly bad, one thing I don't understand how this movie managed to get such high score (7.6). There wasn't even great car chase which you'd expect from the series, neither interesting story or enjoyment.

Make sure before you see it, you turn of your brain and do not question anything. Just don't and you may giggle twice and perhaps enjoy it. Big mistake on my part I didn't do that.",ewing24,6/24/13,2013
317,1,Words cannot fathom the ridiculousness this movie is!,"*****CONTAINS SPOILERS*****

Hmmm... Where to start??? How about the approval of the movie in the first place. How on earth can Hollywood directives approve such a terrible script/plot? A monkey could have done a better job. I am beyond words.

When you set out to watch a movie in the F&F franchise you know that you are going to witness some mediocre/bad acting and unrealistic scenes but this one is just off the rails from beginning to end. Really its laughable! 7,5 in rating. WOW!!!! Unbeleaveable!

The list of things to say about this movie is endless and through out the movie is just keeps getting worse and worse. The ending deserves a comment - it's that ""good"". In the end when you think it cannot get any more absurd the villain Shaw is set free at the risk of millions of lives because Mia has been captured. With zero leverage left to get her back they set him free only to race after him immediately!! Makes no sense. It is bad enough that Shaw manages to coordinate a huge cargo plane to a military base right when he is set free but don't even get me started on the runway. 13 minutes of 110-140 mph speeds - thats only like 20-30 miles of runway. Sure why not.

I cant wait for the next movie.............",therasmus86,7/7/13,2013
321,1,"After ending world hunger, this movie would be next on my list","This movie should be deported to North Korea and forever banned here in the United States.

Absolutely nothing about this movie makes sense. 15 minutes on a runway? What is this, a stairway to heaven or something? Also, the whole point of the movie was to save a member of the crew... and they end up losing a different member at the end. Agitated or disturbed in any way? Nope, they all carry on like nothing happened. Like what?

There were so many ""that doesn't make sense..oh it's just a movie"" scenes where either the protagonists or the antagonists could have ended the movie right there (was really hoping for that to happen so I could go home, take a shower, and go see a doctor for post-bad-movie-thermia)

I paid good dough for this movie and I want a refund for not only my ticket, but the mental and psychological torture that I faced in my Herculean task of keeping my eyes on the screen.

However, this movie did live up to its name. I am now fast and definitely furious.",bobalexander45,6/24/13,2013
324,8,A classic Alpha Male movie,"If you're sick of soulless excessive violent movies, Hollywood got a way to keep you calm as that's the reason why franchise like Fast & Furious keep coming back, each time better. I can say, to me, this is the BEST of all.

For once, we can see past the impression that Fast& Furious is just a car movie, it's about family, loyalty and on-the-road romances. On the last part, remember how we're madly drawn towards Letty & Dominic or Brian& Mia love stories. It's the action that glue all the high packed emotions together, making FF a complete platform of emotions

Secondly, Vin Diesel proves himself an irreplaceable asset to the franchise. Simply put, without him, the movie by and large will loose it magic. He deliver a solid walking tall alpha men stereotype that stands out from others. He can fight, He can lead, He can race. There is something about his voice that set him apart. It's beyond words.

Last but definitely not least, Fast & Furious always got a moment that you walk away from the cinema and can't help talking about it. In this one, that's the moment when DOminic catches Letty when she's falling out of the tank. he catches her, in slow motion of course, w/o being sure if there's another car to bounce off. He was just there for her literally.

and whatever it is, Letty's bitchy look and attitude always screams sexiness

With just these reasons, I can say Fast & Furious have made their way to a Hollywood signature franchise",thaibm,5/31/13,2013
325,1,Stupidest big-budget movie ever made?? Yep.,"OK lets get down to why I think this movie is utterly stupid.

1) When Shaw is trying to escape in the beginning in the low slung racer why the hell didn't cops just block the exit with their cars?? 2)Why didn't Hobbs just use the sniper rifle on Shaw when he was having the talk with Vin Diesel's character?? 3) DO I even need to mention the utterly stupid highway save of Liddie? 4) OK why is that runway scene feel like the longest stupid runway in the world?? 5) If they really wanted to stop the Antonov from taking off why not shoot the bloody tires instead of trying to harpoon the flaps??

Whoever wrote the bloody script and approved everything must've been targeting newborns.",TheDevilsNotetaker,7/24/13,2013
326,9,High quality movie with lots of action.,"This is a great movie. This movie grabs and holds your attention as you go for ""fast and furious"" ride with the now familiar group of guys and gals who are tough on the outside and strong and good on the inside. This is Michelle Rodriguez's best movie to date. She is a wonderful actress and delivers another great performance, and dominates her scenes. The rest of the cast is excellent too. Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson once again team up to create a lot of excitement. The story itself is great. It contains almost nonstop action interspersed with clever lines. The good guys are good and the bad guys are bad. Luke Evans delivers a strong performance as the lead bad guy, Shaw. Although the story is far-fetched and stretches the boundaries of plausibility, still it works, and as a result is entertaining, and for that reason alone this movie is worth watching.",PWNYCNY,5/28/13,2013
329,1,I've Already Seen It,"OK, OK, I'll be honest, I haven't seen this one, but what does that matter? I saw the ""Fast & the Furious,"" & then, thanks to friends I saw ""2 Fast, 2 Furious"" & outside of the cast change, I thought I was watching the same movie.You know, the same movie.The one with Nick Cage ""Gone in 60 Seconds."" No, I'm joking, ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" was a lot better.I think I missed a few, the next one I saw was ""Tokyo Drift."" It was really ""The Fast & the Furious,"" only in Japan, with a slightly different cast.Any way you look at it, if you have seen one you have honestly seen them all. And if you have an IQ above 80, you probably hate them as much as I do.So just re-watch the first one six times. You won't know the difference.",generationofswine,6/10/13,2013
330,8,Bizarro World,"Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is officially the new Arnold Schwarzenegger. But more importantly, the person in charge of keeping The Rock bicep-deep in arm butter should get some Executive Producer credits and be deemed the new hardest working man in Hollywood.Under the direction of Justin Lin, ""Fast & Furious 6"" sees the return of almost everyone from ""Fast Five""; including Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner, Dwayne Johnson as Hobbs, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, etc. as they come together for one last job...again. Also joining the crew is Gina Carano as Hobbs' assistant (and my future wife) who is apparently given free rein to go MMA on everyone she sees fit. And returning (because she's got nothing better to do) is Michelle Rodriguez, in a storyline less focused on, the better.Synopsis: Duhhhhhh.Fast cars go fast.Why the movie works: This is clearly Lin's best visual stab at the franchise yet, as he not only creates the best things-blow-up climax to come out of any of these films, but also (for the second time in a row) gives his audiences exactly what they came to see. Lin does a brilliant job of making sure there is either a car driving fast, a woman in a bikini, or the Rock giving someone the people's eyebrow and spouting off something fantastically WWE-ish, on the screen at all times. In fact, he has done so well with guiding this franchise into the realm of highly entertaining B movie fluff, that it is a wonder why he is being replaced by horror director James Wan for the upcoming ""Fast & Furious 7"".Side Note: I realize Lin did direct both ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" and ""Fast & Furious"" as well, but let's be honest, those movies are better left forgotten.Final Thought: Aside from the fact that ""Fast & Furious 6"" is a tad too long, that Vin Diesel still calls what he does acting, that there is an odd body distortion phenomenon which happens when Diesel and The Rock stand next to each other and that the storyline doesn't really matter (especially the more sentimental sections) I'm not ashamed to say that I was thoroughly entertained as I walked out of the theater. And while I realize that this is a lot to look past, if you are the type to spend your hard earned money on a movie entitled ""Fast & Furious 6""; a movie which is filled with unbelievable, yet well constructed, high flying, auto-centric stunts and enough comic relief to get the casual fan through, then this installment is clearly worth watching.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

332,8,They Got A Tank!,"No doubt that Fast & Furious franchise is the best in its genre (action, fast cars, adrenaline rush!), although Transporter franchise is also good. Justin Lin once again succeeded in bringing us a movie which is not just about fast cars and nitro packs everywhere, but he can also give character development. Like he did to Letty, who suffered from amnesia. But I must admit that it is a typical storyline of one character's memory loss.

The movie began with Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Riley (Gina Carano) in Russia, awesome opening credit containing clips from 5 previous movies which drowned us in nostalgia, then Mia (Jordana Brewster) was about to give birth, Brian (Paul Walker) rushed to be on her side, then Dom (Vin Diesel) and Elena (Elsa Pataky) in their house, suddenly Hobbs showed up offering Dom a ""new job"", Dom called all his team, all his team were enjoying their wealth from the last Brazilian Job, the team united again and met the antagonist, Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) with the help from Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and some other crews. Joe Taslim as Jah was also Shaw's crew. I'm proud of him as an Indonesian, and he got quite a lot of screen portion. He beat Han (Sung Kang) and Roman (Tyrese Gibson), too. But too bad that Rico and Tego didn't appear in this movie. They are hilarious!

This movie is good, adrenaline rush from the fast cars racing, the late night street race in London was a beautiful moment. Yeah, and don't forget the double-decker too. It's not London if there is no double-decker. Action, a (really little) bit of parkour, nitro packs, artillery, guns, fire, explosion, all the action movie lover will love this movie. You won't get sleepy at all during this movie because the sound effect is also amazing, bam in here, boom in there!

But some elements are just so predictable. Just like when Dom and Brian left Elena, Mia, and her baby, I know something gonna happen to the girls and the baby when the team were in London. It's true, Mia was abducted by Shaw and then, yeah, she was saved, but they lost Gisele (Gal Gadot). Han must have been depressed, but in the post-ending scene, Han died anyway, like in Tokyo Drift. But in this scene, Han was showed killed by Ian Shaw (Owen Shaw's brother) who was portrayed by.. Jason Statham! I know, it's about time Statham joined the cast of Fast & Furious.

And there are also many surprise elements in it; Riley was actually working for Shaw, Letty suffered from amnesia (I thought she just became evil), Gisele's death, and Dom saved Letty from falling (the best scene in the movie, made me almost screaming out loud). The most surprising is still the debut appearance of Jason Statham in the post-ending scene. The whole movie is just great, you don't have to think really much when watching this. Just enjoy the fast cars, hilarious scenes (mostly with Roman in it), sexy ladies on the night street car race, and the beautiful landscapes shot.",chrysoberylz,5/22/13,2013
333,1,You cannot do this as director/writer.,"Killing someone in the movie at the end and no one mention that while barbecuing is wrong. Thanks god for bringing Letty home and nothing for Gisele dying. I am giving one start just that made me mad.

What kind of family are they. That's a biggest goof you can do on such a movie. Think about it, they went to save Mia and get Letty, a member of family died trying to do that but no one cared afterwards. Really in real life I would be so mad and maybe turn against them. Hope this is not next FF, where Han does this.

I really enjoyed the move but this thing at the end made me think how whole crew could now say something about it and let it air this way. I had to make this whole explanation, but short one is : You cannot kill a key player like that, I mean its not about killing but its all about not mentioning, I was praying for her to appear at the end but no. Wrong.",flakerimi007,6/1/13,2013
334,10,fast and furious,"I looovvveeed this movie,we were glued to our seats.Let me just say,there is a lot of eye-candy in this movie. Justin and Vin did it again, those guys...I wasn't sure about another movie,but there will be another.Really, most of the action was so new unlike so many movies out today. I am not sure who I like the most, all of the stars are excellent and we hope the girl isn't really dead. The ending,who would have expected to see Jason,there are beautiful men in this movie,OMG. I am a critic,serious movie watcher,and I love talent.This movie is not a 10,but a twelve,easy.Great job guys,and us moms, really appreciate the fact that our family's can view this together. WELL DONE FELLOWS,WELL DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",parkertonea,5/28/13,2013
335,8,"Ridiculous, but very entertaining","Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his fast car crew scored enough from a heist in Brazil in episode 5 to retire (but outside the USA, where they are all wanted). Then Interpol supercop Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) talks them into helping him catch someone who has a fast car crew who may be even better than Dom's, in order to prevent a maguffin which is worth billions to terrorists from falling into the wrong hands. The hook here is that Dom's missus Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who died in an earlier episode, appears not to be dead after all.

Once upon a time there was a movie about the street car racing sub-culture in Los Angeles - notwithstanding the appeal of fast cars (which don't really appeal to me), one would have expected this to be something with limited appeal. Yet here we are with the 6th in the series.

And, while no-one expects it to rank high in the Oscar nomination stakes, it is still an entertaining movie. It has no pretensions to be anything other than a spectacular, action-adventure romp.

This is why it can get away with several high-speed car chases on London streets which are, in places, strangely devoid of traffic, not to mention a lengthy sequence involving a cargo plane trying to take off on a runway which is at least 5 miles long (do the maths). Oh, and - best of all - the most preposterous and exhilarating rescue since Arnie hauled Jamie Lee Curtis out of a limo in True Lies. I nearly cheered.

Roll on episode 7!",neil-476,5/24/13,2013
336,9,This moment. We Own It.,"At first when I heard the song ""We Own It(Wiz Khalifa ft. 2 Chainz)"" playing at the starting credits of the movie which is a collage of first 5 films, I said to myself, ""I have got my money's worth"". Fast and Furious 6 brings out an ensemble cast along with amazing action.In this movie, Hobbs(Dwayne Johnson) seeks the help of Torreto(Diesel) to catch a criminal named Shaw(Evans) by offering him to reunite him with Letty(Rodriguez) who was presumed dead. Then on its the story how Torreto assesmbles the team and takes on Shaw, along with trying his best efforts to get back Letty. The story doesn't have much to it, but its the action sequences with some nest jaw dropping moments in recent times along with one-liners, keeps you entertained. There are few over the top sequences, but Fast and Furious fans are not gonna mind that.Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, essay their roles with ease. In this part we see a lot of action from Dwayne Johnson and trust me its good. Gina Carano's fights are cool. But its Tyrese Gibson with his funny and loud-mouthed Roman Pearce who wins your hearts and a special mention to Ludicrous who has some witty dialogues.Director Justin Lin shows how genius he is at the end when he connects some missing links. Overalll Fast and Furious 6 is another super 'add-on' to one of the enthralling movie franchisees. Go and sit in the Driver's seat!",sujanfaster,5/29/13,2013
337,5,SPOILERS warning,"This movie was a real fun to be if u have not watched the last one hour of the film. from a great surprising plots and great fight and chase scenes the whole thing comes to a halt and seems like we r being made fool at. how can a person jump up from a car moving 80 miles an hour across the bridge , catch a 120 lb lady in air and land on the wind screen of car without getting a single scratch on your face is like having a dream come true utterly nonsense ,stupid and ruined all the charisma and beauty of film.the last 20 minutes were like watching a cartoon movie even that could make some sense .

338,9,One of My favorite Movie,"Will I like this kind of Movie....The Voice and Style of Van Diesel, the Power of Champ(Rock) Outstanding Movie... The F&F 6 I also liked Because the uniqueness in Style like in 6 Series they stole the whole bunch of Money Bank....And the way they carry is WOW... There's love between man and his machine (aka: shiny paint jobs on cars most of us can only afford to download images of); the love of the adrenaline (aka: there goes the neighbourhood, and the city's reconstruction budget); the love of a man with his fellow man.There's also love for the family and the urge to keep it together but most importantly to the antagonist of the movie – the love of money. These last two factors play a big role in Fast 6 (also known as Furious 6). The former of the reasons include the misleadingly deceased Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodrigues), Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel's) former girl- friend, turned amnesiac female muscle of the villains.Letty's actual necessity – as the necessity of any of the parts of the Fast franchise – is questionable. Perhaps it is just as much as the plot device about the villains needing a chip to make a 'Nightshade' contraption capable of blacking out the power of an entire region (seriously? Well we experience the use of same device daily, I guess).This matters not, because for whatever its worth, the Fast movies are beyond unexciting. Mr. Diesel and co. is the reason behind the sale of the tickets; later DVD's; much later the commercials on television. His recent workmates include Dwayne Johnson as Luke Hobbs and Gina Carano as Riley Hicks – aka the anti Letty. Seeing Ms. Carano and Ms. Rodrigues duke it out is one of the giddy delights of Fast 6 (they duke it out twice, so the ticket automatically pays for itself twice at one go). However, there's still more.In keeping with the style here's what you get:Hobbs and Dominic – with their bulging biceps – muscle out frames, trying out plans to knock out the bad guy mercenary (Luke Evans); Brian (Paul Walker), now relegated to a notch-above-extra status, travels back to the US to learn how Letty survived; Roman and Tej (Tyrese Gibson and Chris 'Ludacris' Badges) play with machines; Han and Giesel (Sung Kang, Gal Gadot) provide ancillary window dressing. And of course, let's not forget the usual': mean hot-rods, skimpily clad women and two road- crushing, people-crunching finales – one involving a tank, the other a runaway airplane on a hundred mile runway.Fast 5's climax involved a giant bank vault being through the city, so in keeping with reality is not really a priority here. But by now, you already know that.Starring: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Sung Kang, Gal Gadot, Luke Evans, Gina Carano, and Elsa Pataky.Fancylive.com",ooppssee,6/13/13,2013

340,9,The Fast and the Furious:Part 6.,"With having been left gasping for air after seeing Fast Five,thanks to it unexpectedly rejuvenating the franchise with an amazing confidence,I decided to pay a visit to local cinema with some friends,where we all buckled up,and got set to witness the sixth part in the franchise speed across the screen.

The plot:

Investigating a recent theft of military equipment from a Russian convoy,Dipolmatic Security Service agents Luke Hobbs and Riley discover that the attack was committed by a highly trained gang,led by a former British Special Forces solider called Owen Shaw.Fearing that the military equipment could soon disappear onto the black market,Hobbs decides that it is time to take drastic measures and fight fire with fire,by locating the leader of a gang who stole $100 million right under Hobbs nose.

Eventally locating the gangs former leader (Dominic Toretto) on an isolated erotic island,Hobbs is left disappointed,after Toretto gives him a stone face answer,that he has no interest at all in working for Luke.Pulling out his trump card,Hobbs calls Dominic's bluff by revealing to him a top secret photo that was recently taken of the thieves,which reveals that Toretto's ""dead"" girlfriend Letty is actually alive and well,and currently working with the gang.

Desperate top see Letty again,Dominic grudgingly accepts Luke's request and begins to gather up his old gang.As Toretto and the gang begin to investigate Owen Shaw's recent activates,Dominic begins to fear that Letty may not give him the warm welcome that he had originally expected�

View on the film:

Despite having to complete 18 months worth of post-production in a 12 week period (which led to 3 editors being hired for the movie!),director Justin Lin shows a new clarity for each of the tremendous action scenes,with the limited post-production time allowing Lin to give the film a real raw edge.

Smartly placing just enough character beats so as to allow each of the actors their moment in the one-liner spotlight,Lin takes the gravity defying action of Fast Five to a new,literally in the air defying the laws of physics level,with Lin giving the excellent London location a futuristic sheen,as he takes the viewer on a joyful,tongue firmly placed in motor-mouth thrill ride,which go from isolated, one on one street races in sections of London that are,in reality never anything less than jam packed, (the crew were only given 2 minutes every hour to film on some of the UK's busiest roads) to Lin finishing the movie on an epic car (s) V plane fiery race to the finish.

Bringing a striking new element to the franchise,director Justin Lin places all of the female character's of the film right at the centre of the movie,with Toretto's desire to uncover Letty's recent activates being used as the main plot thread which keeps the film speeding along.

Along with being much more involved in the story part of the movie,Lin also gives each of the actresses some of the films most intense action beats,with a hard-hitting,rough'n tumble fight between Letty (played by a feisty Michelle Rodriguez) and Riley (played by a take no prisoners Gina Carano) being the most gripping action scene of the entire movie.

For his terrific screenplay of the movie,Chris Morgan carefully balances moving the franchise forward with an espionage angle,that leads to each of the gang having doubts about their alliance's,whilst also making sure to include enough mention to past events in the films which allow for a side plot to slowly develop,which ends up delivering a huge scorpion like sting at the end of the film,as Morgan begins to fully display the new road that this fast,and very furious film is racing upon.",morrison-dylan-fan,5/25/13,2013
341,1,tired addition to the franchise,"I was actually looking forward to this, right up until the point i actually watched it. I always believed that the object of a film should be to immerse the audience and suspend disbelief, and while the former was possible the latter never happened. Let's leave aside the obvious issue with any law enforcement agency of any type based within the countries known as the ""5 eyes"" requiring a group of retired criminals to work on their behalf. It would never happen. Lets also ignore the obvious problem within the plot regarding surveillance cameras in London, the most ""watched"" city in the world being conveniently ""down for maintenance"". As there are multiple agencies controlling multiple cameras in that country there is no chance that all those agencies would be offline at the same time. ""Brian"" managing to spend less than 24 hours in a California maximum security prison, ""as a favour"", after flying there and back seemingly in a couple of days and securing all the information he needed. Anyone who is even remotely aware of the American justice system would find that laughable. The plane chase along a runway that must have been at least 20 miles long for the amount of time it took the C5 Galaxy/ Illyshin IL76 (take your pick of heavy lift aircraft) to not quite take off, making it the longest non existent runway in the world. Street racing in central London lets ignore the fact that this scene had no reason to be in the film at all for a moment, except as justification for the title. It's Impossible! Flat out impossible with traffic calming measures, and some of the most crowded and narrow streets in the world, not to mention enormous police presence. Let's not even discuss the tank! So a film with a very lose series of sequences, based basically in London, i guess because the film grants went that way, because there is no reason any international criminal on every law enforcement radar in the western world would base himself in that city, dialogue that was so poor and so clichéd that it is worth watching only with the sound turned off, and a plot that has absolutely zero possibility of ever being believable and you have this film in a nutshell. Let's hope they give the next part of the franchise to some adults for script writing, because while the 13 year old's had a ball bringing this one to the screen, it can surely only appeal to those with a similar mindset.

342,9,Best Fast and Furious to date!!!!,"Freaking AAAAA!!!!! Wow, best Fast and the Furious to date!!!! Everything you need is right here. Drama, love, suspense, action, comedy, non stop thriller. This movie has more twist and turns then most movies in the last 5-years. And that's saying a lot!! It combines the previous Fast and the Furious together.......with the added twist at the very end. Boy, if you guys have doubts about this movie, say no more. This is a must see. Worth the money? Hell yeah and more.All the cast and crew comes back so you won't be disappointed. It leaves off from the last one. The story all flow together extremely well. Familiar faces, familiar foes. I mean, it's huge. The ads and trailers don't this movie justice.

343,10,Awesome!,"Watched it 4 times already! Fast and furious 6 is equal with fast and furious one (fast 1 would only win because when it came out it was new and cool). The fast and furious franchise has, since number 4, improved dramatically in terms of screenplay, quality of acting, storyline and action sequences!The coming together of the team again together with ""The Rock"" Dwayne Johnson, really brings the chemistry of the team to another level. Watching Brian and Dom work together to run the team works so well, and each team member really brings in a special element that they can add to the team.The return of Letty to the franchise also helps to complete this and is good to see her character return to the story!Fast Cars, Amazing Soundtracks, Awesome Stunts and action sequences, overflowing testosterone and classic one liners really make fast and furious 6 the great movie that it is! 10 out of 10!Make sure you wait until the end of the credits!There's a reason why this movie was number one in the world for two weeks!",mooks88,6/27/13,2013
344,9,Arguably the best movie in the franchise,"The sixth and latest installment in the Fast and the Furious franchise sees Agent Hobbs ask for the help of Dominic Toretto and his gang help track down a wanted criminal.I have to say that this was the movie I was most looking forward to in the 2013 Summer blockbuster period, and I'm glad to say that I got what I wanted from it.The movie had a lot of exciting action sequences which made it an improvement to the previous movie. Given that a lot of action movies lately have been disappointing mainly because of the lack of action, this is continuing the resurrection of proper action movies following The Expendables movies and The Last Stand. Let's hope this path remains open. Being a UK citizen, I loved the idea of having it set in London and having some of the action scenes take place in London, even though they were actually filmed in Glasgow. It made good use of the London scenery and it was nice to see the fabulous Rita Ora make a cameo. It also had a lot of humour which made it funnier than most bad comedy movies and even some popular ones which in my opinion were overrated (*cough* The Hangover *cough* Ted *cough*). The story-line wasn't exactly good but then again, none of the story- lines in any of the movies in this series are. At the end of the day, it's more style than substance. If I have one criticism to make, it's that one or two of the stunts were unrealistic. But let me put it this way - at least it's not as bad as a lot of really terrible and over-the-top Bollywood movies.I seriously think that this is the movie that should've rounded off the franchise rather than make a seventh movie for next year. All I can hope for now is that without Justin Lin on board, they don't mess it up.",amalank,5/19/13,2013
346,8,Ride or die... Remember?,"This is not just a sequel, but it's a back to back sequel that goes back to all the five previous films. As we all know, Furious 6 stars the same cast from Fast Five (except Don Omar & Tego Calderon) and adds up new characters in the franchise who are Shaw (Luke Evans), Jah (Joe Taslim), Riley (Gina Carano) and brings back Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who was last seen in Fast & Furious (2009).This is definitely fast and furious if you compare this one to the other films. This is not about street racing. This is not about running away. And this is definitely not about another heist. Chris Morgan has sat down and written a predictable and strong script that drags ''The Fast And The Furious'' franchise more audience. But what we all should not forget is that this film is like a meal that has all types of delicious tastes. It has speed cars, amazing action sequences, sexy ladies, jokes that'll make you laugh for a while and at the end a surprise. Simply said, it's the action packed blockbuster of the year! It's actually pretty cool to see Dominic (Vin Diesel), Brian (Paul Walker) and the rest of the crew take side with Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson). When you leave the theater, it will give you a different, but satisfied feeling. Probably because all the actors in this film have important roles that just turn out to be bigger and bigger for each and every sequel. It's not just about Dom and Brian, but about everyone. Without one of all these characters, Furious 6 would have been a mess. That says how important each and every character is.Furious 6 is not a fun ride like Fast Five, but it is a serious ride. This is not the film you want to miss at the theater. Book the tickets as soon as possible, buy a pop-corn and soda and enjoy this ride. This is way better than what you think/expect.Dear Justin Lin, Thank you for the 4 fantastic films that you've directed in The Fast And The Furious saga. You will definitely be missed in the next film.",dkemathas,5/24/13,2013
347,9,More Furious than ever!,"I don't think there has ever been a franchise in which the sixth entry has been it's best. I also don't think there has ever been a franchise where it really started getting good with the fourth. But here it is Furious 6 is one of the most entertaining action films I've ever seen. I won't lie and say that the series isn't a pure unadulterated guilty pleasure but make no mistake there is quality here. Director Justin Lin seems to be a master of orchestrating grand action set pieces, family melodrama thats actually engaging and a group of actors that let's face it are coasting on pure charisma and presence in these films at least. It's also surprising to see a franchise whose numbers have grown critically with each installment reaching an all time high with almost 80% positive on rotten tomatoes. And it's completely deserving. Picking up where the super entertaining Fast Five left off we find out automotive heroes enjoying their riches when Hobbs played by the king of likable himself the Rock tracks down Toretto (Diesel) for help with a very attractive international terrorist played by sexy Luke Evans the twist that was displayed in the last film is played as he tells him that the supposedly dead Letty played by Micelle Rodriguez with fierce sneer is alive and kicking. He of course immediately gathers up the gang and they go after her. What unfolds is a bit ridiculous which should be expected but it's also explosive. From the film's twists to the utter charm oozing off these actors to the one of a kind testosterone fueled adrenaline pumping action sequences this is one hell of a ride. There's even a few big surprises especially towards the end. With this entry they prove the formula isn't a fluke and I look forward to loads of more vehicular carnage for years to come. Gone are odd character moments and insipid car themed dialogue and what's replaced them is something you shouldn't feel guilty about loving cause it's awesome! 4.5/5",rivertam26,5/27/13,2013
349,2,The stupidity of inaccuracy,"This movie contains just to many errors. OK of course a director could bend the laws of physics a bit in his favor, but this was just to much to handle. It starts with the opening scene, lots of really ugly edited sped up shots of 2 cars racing. For some reason a charger can keep up with a GTR, but OK. Then, since when is a landing strip 20 miles long? The airplane scene just doesn't seem to end, and when it does, hey there's the end of the runway... finally... after 15 minutes of 100mph driving and fighting. Also there are cars flying trough the aircraft as if it was made out of cardboard... Everybody is shifting gears (with the lever) in cars with automatic transmissions (also the ones with paddles on the wheel) probably to make it seem like they are driving ""really fast"". Please just hire pro drivers, put a camera on a lower point of view and actually drive fast, it will look fast. The tank is an ugly prop, when it breaks out of the truck it's in the canon hangs loose as if it's not even bolted to the tank. Someone slapped on some parts to hide the actual tank and the director doesn't even know what he's dealing with because in interviews he is talking about a WWII tank, but in fact it's a British Chieftain tank first build in the 1960s. (i believe WWII only lasted until 1945) It's driving over cars as if they are not even there (ok a tank can do that) but when he gets to the car of one of the main characters, for some reason that car just gets pushed forward for 2 minutes. Also apparently in Spain its the middle of the day while it's midnight in London (1 hour time difference in the real world). The whole movie is just really bad, the acting is horrible, the story is bad, and there's not a single scene that doesn't contain an error of some kind. Other Fast and Furious movies were over the top, but this just was to much stupidity for one movie.",nirvanaisgoed,8/17/13,2013
350,8,Firing on all cylinders!,"I haven't always had a love affair with the F&F series. I thought the first one was pretty dumb, hated the second, and never saw the third. The fourth drew me in - I rented it at some point and found it really entertaining. Then, they brought in The Rock for the fifth, and I knew I had to see it. Justin Lin made a near perfect action movie with Fast Five, including one of the best action movie sequences (as unbelievable as it may be) of all time with the safe steal. That heightened my expectations for Fast & Furious 6.Let's get this out of the way first - this movie has a terrible, terrible script. The dialogue is beyond horrible, to the point of eye rolling, and there are plot holes galore. However, you don't go into a F&F movie expecting to see a great script or natural dialogue - you go in to see over the top action set pieces, fast cars, and butt kicking...and on those notes, it hits on all cylinders.There isn't anything in this movie that tops the stolen safe from Fast Five, but a scene featuring a tank on a freeway comes pretty damn close. The finale is also really intense, but I wish it would have been shot during the day instead of night, because a lot of what's going on is hard to see. I understand it was probably done for editing purposes, but a lot of it was just so confusing during the end. We get to see a lot of classic cars, testosterone, and explosions - overall, it's just a really fun movie, as ridiculous as it may be at points.Don't get out of your seat right after the movie ends. There's a scene at the end that is surprising and amazing.",Jay-Klee,5/27/13,2013
351,9,A great addition to the Fast and Furious franchise,"*contains spoiler* I can't wait for the movie to be released since the first time I heard that Fast and Furious 6 is going to be released and on production. Since Fast 5 is awesome, I expect more from Fast 6, and I am not disappointed, the movie is even more awesome than the previous one, at least I think it is. It is a great addition to the Fast and Furious franchise. More amazing fight scenes, a car that honestly first time i looked at it i think ""wow bat mobile"", funny scenes...and a TANK! Yes, a tank. Though, there's a scene when i thought ""is that even possible?!"", the 'catching scene'. However, you will not be disappointed. And the very last scene, Jason Statham..I can't wait for Fast 7.

Joe Taslim, playing as Jah, he is an actor from Indonesia, and Indonesians are all eager to watch this movie, we are all surprised (those who have watched it) that Joe said two words, yes even two words, we are all excited, in Indonesian language. And for your information which is not exactly necessary, but those two words are ""hantam mereka"" which is subtitled as ""i need your help"" is kinda wrong. It's actually like ""hit/beat/smash them"". Congratulations to Joe Taslim, it's really huge to be in this movie. (excuse my English)",kenziavaletta-696-515824,5/27/13,2013
353,3,"""Too gimmicky""","Horrible. Very flashy lost tack of who was flying where and whose not hurt and how many punches were thrown. They should have just made them all drag racing super heroes instead this, it was too gimmicky. A three because there were some funny witty moments but overall not a must see at all, would only recommend seeing if its a gift card you are trying to use.I was not a fan of the serious at all, and to be honest with all of you this is the VERY FIRST of the series I see. I am do not watch these types of films with far fetched intertwined over the top plots that later on make all the characters become involved in very elusive almost cartoonish stunts. But hey its memorial day weekend and I was dragged. So do not expect much of this film just watch it with a grain of salt :) ha",kcg45,5/27/13,2013
355,9,A great fast and furious.,"Very enjoyable Fast and Furious that won't disappoint the fans. Tons of action which looks great especially in Imax, and all the favorite gang is there.

Highly recommended if you like this type of film and especially if you're an FF fan.

What I didn't like (warning - MASSIVE SPOILERS):

The ending was pretty sad in the bottom line. The bad guy basically got away (he got kicked off the plane but there's every reason to assume he survived). Han and Gisele both died, each on a separate occasion. Dom and Elena broke up once Letty got back into the picture (still not remembering anything about their past together).

Yes I know, Hollywood movies are mocked for their uncompromising happy endings, so what was this, an attempt not to be a Hollywood movie? LOL. If you are an FF fan who relates to the characters, it just sucks to see favorite heroes die or break up like that.

Yes I know, probably the actors didn't sign up for the next sequel so they had to ditch the characters. But I'd rather they ditched them in a happy ending way. How about Han hooking up with Elena for example ;)

So that's what I didn't like. Everything else was great.

Go watch in Imax! And rejoice that it's not 3d because that 3d is getting tiresome (and the proportions are twisted more often than not). FF6 was made just right!",gabriel100,5/28/13,2013
357,1,I didn't enjoy,"Well as a fan of action movies , i should say this movies couldn't impress me at all, i had really expected something more interesting to watch . i kept pressing the forward button . because this movie was just predictable. i just like one dialog . maybe its just me , but i think a movie must be able to keep the audience on it for every second of the movie. if it can't do that its better to not to be released . i wonder what the hell critics do over there .shouldn't they watch a movie before they let it be released ? the director truly wasted all the talents on this movie.waste of time , money and everything .avoid watching",machamkon,6/18/13,2013
359,9,The Best One Yet. READ 9/10,"OK, After seeing the trailer and seeing the ""Airplane"" i thought ""this is gonna be horrible"" and guess what... IT WAS AWESOME. Honestly there isn't a single franchise that has the 6th film be the best, until now. Everyone is back, the story was great, then action was seriously out of this world. This film makes Iron Man 3 look like garbage. I mean that. This is without a doubt the action film of the summer, and is going to be very difficult to top. And like all great movies, the ending was perfect. Go see it, I will be seeing it again, and without a doubt buying this one on Blu-Ray. If the trailer is stopping you from seeing this, don't let it, it's so worth your time and money.",creepyhoodedboy,5/24/13,2013
361,5,Ridiculous,"Parts of the movie were decent, but there wasn't a whole lot of a plot line since we already know Letti is still alive. To me, and many others I've talked to that have seen the movie, it's just so freakishly unrealistic that it ruins the whole show. Most notably would be where Dom jumps out of his moving car, flies through the air, catches Letti and they crash into the windshield of another car and no one is hurt. This film series has devolved into nothing more than a cash cow with mediocre acting at best, and a bunch of unrealistic stunts, and virtually no plot line. Sad. For the first F&F to be so good, and they just keep getting worse. Since I need to add more lines to submit this, the entire sequence involving the plane on the runway was absurd too. I expected some ridiculous stunts, but not over the top ridiculous, and that was the bulk of the entire show.",Jayme96,5/30/13,2013
362,10,..aw sum movie.. just like old times...,"an excellent movie having great fun action & little bit romance..the sixth gear actually builds up the franchise into one of the best movie franchise of all times....""...a superior piece of classical action craftsmanship... Lin and veteran screenwriter Chris Morgan have labored to add depth, dimensionality and inner conflict...""""Remember the second you go through those doors,"" says Vin Diesel's Dom Toretto. ""Everything changes."" Now that's wishful thinking. The Fast And The Furious films have never strayed too far from the formula, just doing enough tinkering under the hood to keep the franchise purring.This time the gang decamp to London after Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) – the dogged DSS agent who pursued them through Rio last time out – comes asking for help.Wisely, he wants to use the street-smarts of Dom, Brian (Paul Walker) and the rest for a their crew for a particularly dangerous mission. The target? A gang of pro hijackers led by ex-Special Ops soldier Owen Shaw (Luke Evans, excellent). The reward? Full pardons for Dom and his crew. The bait? That Dom's ex Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) – thought dead after a car accident in the fourth film – is alive and working with Shaw.",darkknightrises45,5/23/13,2013
363,10,Start Your Engines!,"I watched ""Fast & Furious 6"" earlier yesterday, and I must say that this movie is amazing! I didn't think Lin could top 2011s FAST FIVE but this sixth installment is bigger & better! With extensive, explosive & entertaining action sequences, big laughs & lots of drama - Furious 6 delivers everything you'd expect + more! the pacing is perfect, it's great to see the team working together again, and the story is very intriguing - if you're a fan of the previous movies than this one will mean even more to you.Letty's presence is carefully scripted, and Shaw's ties to a former foe lead the team down some dark paths.. but thankfully they have Hobbs to help clear the way to take down this very dangerous gang.Everything comes full circle, and while it is fulfilling - it's also very dramatic how everything ends. You can never really go home again, it's always a different experience.Lin does a great job of balancing the characters, action pieces & story. Some really unexpected twists throughout - you won't see 'em coming!Make sure you watch(ed) 2009s FAST & FURIOUS & FAST FIVE before this- otherwise you'll be quite confused. And just to clarify - this IS another PREQUEL to Tokyo Drift! I highly recommend this movie to all movie-goers, it's a gem. Congrats to Lin & team!",JamminRon,5/19/13,2013
365,1,De gustibus...,"To start with: I'm a film amateur and I appreciate those old fashioned films that nearly no one bears. Given this preamble I have to say I'm really astonished by the votes here on IMDb. I give this film the worst possible vote not since it deserves it but just to push a balanced judgement as it's now on cinema and the actual average is 6,5 (I'd give it a 4-5). The film is a standard B-movie with the standard ingredients of the series. Races, pursuits, and everything authors could think when dealing with cars. Add some nice guys, some nice girls, a bad guy and expect authors to force their minds to find something more engaging than the 5th film finale (I admit it: 5th film final 10 minutes scene was really good from an action film perspective). Everything is predictable. Irony tries to be there but fails. Characters seem to follow a 200y old theater script. This seems to be just the summary of what producers think about the audience of their series: vroom, boom, bang, boobs, lol. Not good at all. I could give it a 6 only if I'd be with no money and I'd need to justify myself after spending my last 10 dollars on this flick. Fortunately I'm not so desperate.",Ladiloque,5/31/13,2013
366,10,best movie ever!,this movie is the best ever it is so exciting to watch if u see the trailer then u really feel like watching it because it has a lot of action and brilliant cars the actors are exceptional and the action is very good. i really like the cars in this movie when ever they drive the cars they drive them really fast and thats why i have rated this film 10 out of 10 it is 100% phenomenal the best part about this movie is the actors they are really good. i have never seen so good actors that can drive cars so good. the best thing about there driving is that they know hot to control it when they turn corners they just act like they know there is a car there. Vin diesel is a really good driver in this movie he really knows every police mans move he knows were to turn he even knows the whole place t the back of his hand.,hamza-ali57919,7/12/13,2013
368,9,Probably the best yet,"I don't want to go into too much detail because I hate when reviews contain spoilers and I want to make sure I don't do that. To keep this short and too the point this is probably the best movie in the series so far. If you've been a fan since the first film you will definitely enjoy this one as they go back to more of the street racing and such that was so prevalent in the first film. There are a few twists and surprises to this one, and yes a few scenes where you sit back and say ""Not possible"" or ""Only in a movie"" but what would an action movie be without completely impossible scenes at times?

Truth be told, go see it, I highly, HIGHLY doubt you will leave feeling like you wasted your time or your money...and make sure you stay past the initial credits.",Miller_K,5/27/13,2013
369,4,Going Fast made me Furious,"Fast and Furious 6 is the sixth installment in the popular, Fast & Furious franchise. I think Fast 5 is absolutely awesome, but this is just so... DULL. This film has been done before and better. Fast and Furious 6 is just so dumb. It has good cinematography and placement of the camera, but not much else. It definitely chooses style over substance, and that got annoying when you heard this characters speaking every major plot point... BOOOO!This film is just so uninteresting, but it does have some promising visual effects.4 out of 10.",joe-is-sexy,6/25/13,2013
373,2,Fast & Furious 6...1 out of 4 Skittles,"So after 6 installments of the Fast & Furious franchise this is what we know for sure�1. A good story and/or script aren't necessary to have a successful movie franchise, 2. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson really likes his muscle juice and 3. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker still can't act.

Fast & Furious 6 (Dear God�why have you people let them get to 6) is absolutely ridiculous. And not the good kind of ridiculous like�did you see what Walter White just did on the last episode of Breaking Bad kind of ridiculous�I'm talking about the dumbest, most absurd, I can't believe people actually go to tanning beds and purposely get beamed with cancer rays kind of ridiculous.

The first few Fast movies took themselves soooo serious it actually made them kind of funny to watch. Similar to seeing an episode of Honey Boo Boo on TV�it's mindless good fun, but after a while you just need a shower to wash the stench of stupidity off yourself. But the sixth installment has gone off into a distant planet that has yet to be discovered. Is the film campy? Are they intentionally trying to make a bad movie, or is this all a joke that Hollywood is playing on us to see just how stupid the audience actually is? It's hard to say�but one thing is for sure�this is not a good movie no matter what the bulked up nimrods at your gym tell you.

The story is just plain dumb, the dialogue is unrelatable to the way any humans I know speak, and the action sequences are so unbelievable they make The Avengers movie seem like a true story. These characters literally jump from car to car traveling at top speeds, and walk away with minor scratches. Are you kidding me? At least John McClane gets a little bloody when he leaps through glass windows in all the Die Hard movies. **Spoiler Alert** Vin Diesel's character actually gets shot in the chest, then pulls the bullet out himself, and walks away like nothing happened. Seriously???

I get it�most people go to the movies to escape their normal boring lives. You want to see unusual people doing unusual things, but seriously�if your life is so hard pressed for escapism that you find these Fast & Furious movies entertaining then it's probably already too late for you. I hope you enjoy the next Honey Boo Boo episode, because intelligence has waved bye bye to you for good.

374,9,Traditional Fast and Furious movie with surprises in it.,"The story line is continued from the previous part. So you will find relations and references to their previous parts. It is satisfactory actually. In here they have added back a few characters, lost a few. And I should say, they are gonna introduce a really special character in their 7th part (I should keep that a secret for now). Totally combined package of guns, blood, bullets, cars, and everything you can imagine in a Vin Diesel + Dwayne Johnson kind movies. And for action, I should say they have really worked hard. Forget critics. If you are in the FastnFurious line, this is a must watch. Also, they have got a tank!!! Worth the buck.",bnitishpai,5/30/13,2013

This movie is a really really enjoyable fun packed in a superb dose of action. Maybe 10 is a very high note, but thinking on the kind of movie we decide to see, is what it deserves. The movie have a lot of jokes that really work well with the plot. It's hard to get that combination (plot-jokes) work properly but this is one of that rare cases. About the action, the scenes looks very natural maybe some annoying close ups but overall very good job with chasing scenes. Funny, nice twists, nice action scenes, by far the best of the whole series. People was laughing, wowing and clapping. You love cars, action and fun? then you have to see it and enjoy it asap.

377,3,"Should be renamed to ""punch and furious"" it has nothing to do with cars",I just watched the movie in anticipation of seeing some cool cars and unbelievable races like in the first two installments of the franchise so here is an opening scene with a new Skyline playing catch with a Dodge Challenger in twisty Spanish mountain roads and I think to myself GREAT start I'm gonna love this one! So about an hour passes by seeing a couple of stationary exotic and classic cars but nothing exciting in terms of racing and a few nonsensical hand to hand combat. Fast forward about another hour and the only thing that has to do ANYTHING with vehicles is a tank rolling over small old cars in a highway and yes that was it SERIOUSLY??? Is the franchise about cars or not? Even as an action movie it sucks big time as the plot is very superficial and the clich�s were predictable long before they said them. Really if I didn't have any ironing to do to keep me busy it would be too painful to watch. a five years old would catch up to the plot and the acting full of goofs. For example Letti is hanging from the window seal with one hand pointing the gun with the other hand and guess what her arm that hold her from falling is bent and relaxed... now unless you are incredible Hulk it is impossible. In bullet points: Bad Acting Superficial plot (I wouldn't mind that if the movie was about cars) Nonsensical violence (time fillers) NO CARS!!!!!,christoforospaphitis,9/8/13,2013

Somehow, they continue to seamlessly weave the story lines of all previous f&f's together so that it all comes together with a big aha! Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel (wow!) are both very good in their respective roles. There really is no supporting cast in this movie because everyone carries off their roles like lead actors.

379,8,Must Watch!,"Fast & Furious 6 Review : A team of lethally skilled mercenary drivers led up by a criminal master mind Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) attacks and rob some parts of a satellite from a military convoy in Spain now Agent Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) is given a responsibility to hunt them down but given that they are fast he needs a team to catch them and that's where comes in our Daredevil Duos Dominick Torreto (Vin Diesel) & Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and their team. Apparently at the end of Fast 5 they are ultra-rich retired international criminals sipping beer in Spain living life peacefully until hobbs recruit them. The team come together ones again but this time to rescue the old gf of Dom. Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) who presumed to be dead but revealed to be still alive with total memory loss and works for the bad guys now. As the story goes on you'ii be thrilled with awesome car chases, explosions, action, humor etc.. at one point as Roman says they are hunting their evil twins! as the movie come to its end Gisele (Gal Gadot) sacrifices her life to save Han (Sung Kang) and all bad guys are dead and Letty is now good girl and all goes well!!

Now Han goes to Tokyo to keep his promise to Gisele where all events from The Third Franchise of the series The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) happens so we can assume Tokyo Drift is chronologically the final chapter in the current series. And guess what they show the events of Tokyo Drift where Han dies of car crash. I was thinking they are showing how Han survived that crash and lived but they were showing the plot of the next film and Jason Statham one of my favourite action hero is the bad guy who killed Han and is the villain of Fast & Furious 7!

380,9,This series just keeps getting better,"This is one of those rare occasions when a franchise goes from being okay to being absolutely awesome. 12 years ago, I would have never expected this series to make it this far and not only that, to evolve into what it is today. Furious 6 does not pretend to be anything else but a high octane summer action movie and it does it better than any other movie this year so far.In Furious 6 agent Hobbs request the help of Dominic and his crew to find a dangerous mercenary in exchange for full pardon, but also to find Dominic's believed deceased girlfriend, Letty. This movie almost feels like a testosterone 007 movie. The series takes us to Spain and England. The chase sequences are just amazing, the stuns are great, and the cars, well; it's a Fast and Furious film. The acting it's what it is, but the thematic of family and friendship are believable and heartwarming. The main villain this time around is pretty solid and does feel like a true challenge for the protagonists. This movie was so well made and so fun to watch that after watching the surprise revelation at the ending credits I can't wait to see the next one. Furious 6 has it all, action, comedy, women, and a lot of insane cars. This is what true blockbuster movies are all about. I highly recommended.",nvillesanti,5/27/13,2013
381,1,Seriously,"Why is this movie rated higher than Paul Thomas Andersen's The Master or Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. It isn't shocking to see a mindless movie like this gross a lot of money at the box office, since it is 12 year old's that frequent cinemas, but i can't understand why this movie has a 7.4 rating on IMDb where 12 year old's don't own accounts.I liked fast 5 because, so i went to the theater with my friends with bigger expectations and came out highly disappointed. the movie is full of plot holes to begin with. I usually forgive summer movies for this sin but it way to much here. It wasn't as half as funny as the first one. Some of the lines between Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous, who isn't a good actor by the way, aren't amusing. What is worse is that some times other conversations are introduced just so as to bring in a line between these two. It must be the epitome of bad script writing. My 13 year old sister could write better lines. The action sequences are also ludicrous. I know this is a fast and furious movie but the guys here do some stuff here that Spider-Man only dreams of. What is even more insulting is that the critiques aren't all that hard on this movie. I don't know why some summer movies are admonished for minor misdemeanors but this one gets a pass. One critique wrote that the fast and furious movies are getting so good that by the time they get to fast 16 it would be up for best picture. Do you value time and money? Do you have an IQ above 70? Are you older that 12? If your answer is no, then you are in for a treat.",christian-tesfaye,7/24/13,2013

Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson and the rest of the bunch are back for FF 6, including Dominic's ex g/f Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) back from the dead (don't you love how they do that in movies?). The plot has something to do with preventing some international bad guys from getting the final piece to some dreaded weapons system, and...oh who cares?

What's great about FF 6 is, like it's last couple of predecessors, it doesn't take itself too seriously..at least not too often..or get too distracted with silly things like a story. There are a few obligatory moments of feigned drama, but it's once you get past those and get to the racing that the movie really gets fun (there's one bad-ass racing sequence in particular, through the streets of London). Racing, shootouts, cool cars and hot babes bending over..what else do you need?

Stay tuned for FF 7.",eti55,6/17/13,2013
385,5,"throughly enjoyable, but who the hell wrote the script","*****************This Review may contain some spoilers******************

""this is just an action film so who cares about the script it's all about the action"" Well not anymore people are not as dumb as they used to be anymore i mean hello it's the 21st century so here's what i think was wrong with this movie.

The Dialogue was one of the worse i have ever seen, i've seen so many awful films with better dialogue.


The script was at moments so confusing for instance can anyone explain to me how the bloody hell Gina Carano's character turned out to be a traitor who works for Shaw I know i'm not watching a Christopher Nolan Film but shouldn't there be any hints or something.


Last time i checked there is no 100000000 mile long Runways.


The Tank scene when Dom jumps out of his car to catch Letty and then they crash on a car which becomes bloody junk but the couple just manages to walk out without a single scratch. at some point i thought that this is the twist where Dom discovers that he is in fact Hancock jr or something.


Shaw is an ex special forces turned terrorist fighs like a girl, or it's just like i said before Dom has some superpowers of some kind he is so strong that Shaw was left hopeless.


Brian O'Connor and ex FBI agent now a crook goes back to the united states as a prisoner with another name but no even one of the prison guards recognised his face.


Am I the only one who thinks that Roman is not funny.


I think it's too late for this but apart from Thr Rock and Michelle Rodriguez the rest of the cast should work on their acting it's pathetic.",Jqn_Hgar,8/19/13,2013
386,8,Enjoyable and spectacular instalment! 8.,"I must say this is a saga I like. I liked the first installment, hated the two and third movies (awful) and was positively surprised by the next three, in fact, these are the best, specially the sixth. It is not an epic saga, like ""Star wars"", ""Indiana Jones"", ""Mission: impossible"" and ""007"", but it is very enjoyable and worth watching for the action fans like me. Justin Lin managed to revitalize the saga with the fourth part of it after those two piece of rubbish. In fact, the six one fixed in some way the third one (I should say it gives some sense to the third movie at the end). He really knows how to deal with action. It is true the action scenes are inverosimile, but they agree with the movie's tone. The car chases, gunshots and body fights are spectacular and one of the main attraction in the movie. The pace is another strong point. It never made me bored in spite of its more-than-two-hour-duration and poor performances. It begins by introducing the characters and their situation and then, the action begins with many explosions, chases, shots, twists, etc. The sceneography is very nice, the best in the saga: the Canary Islands, London and L.A. The soundtrack is very good and proper, too (listen to the song ""We own it""). The cast is attractive: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, The Rock, Elsa Pataky, Ludicrous, Gina Carano, Luke Evans, Jason Statham... Except the last two, these are not very good as actors, but are very appropriate for this kind of movies and deliver fun (not deep and dramatic) performance. This is not about character development at all, however it is true there is an evolution in the main character's lifes, which is good indeed. Vin Diesel is one of the least expressive actors in Hollywood's history (The Rock acts better even though he is not a real actor but a wrestling factor, unlike Vin). Paul Walker is dull and they should dress him better to take advantage of his beauty. Fortunately, Elsa's character is unimportant and the script contains many jokes. Anyway, in this aspect, this is the best movie in the saga because the cast contains both Jason Statham and Luke Evans. They are evil characters. The first only appears for a few seconds but very intensely. Luke Evans as the main villain plays a very believable and tough role which represents an added value for the movie. In conclusion, the worst in the movie are its lack of originality, rather flat characters and dull performances from many actors. The best thing is that it gives sense to the threequel, the pace, the capacity of entertaining, the cast, the action scenes (specially the first car chase in London), the sceneography (London is the city I visited I like the most), the main villain, Statham's cameo and the cars. I recommend it to the fans of this saga. 8.",manusanchez90,5/30/13,2013
387,10,This is a review on Fast and Furious 6,"How should I start off this wonderful review? Hmm... Maybe I should start off by saying this movie is probably the best one yet in the ""Fast and Furious"" serious! Maybe I could even say this movie is the best movie of 2013! This movie is what some people like me like to call diversified, I mean it has a little bit of action, comedy, and a slight bit of romance. There's this special type of bond that Paul Walker and Vin Diesel have when they are acting together, it's like they bring out the best of each other and when you have two good actors that can do something like that, it helps the other actors in the movie step their game up. Ide also like to give congrats to the director of the film Justin Lin for another job well done. He never fails to amaze me with greatness. To sum this whole thing up this movie is great and should be seen by any and everybody!",bigsean863,6/18/13,2013
388,1,"blah blah boom stunts...fine, but how in the world did this script make it to screens?","Fast 6 starts out as a promising film. Brian feels something is missing and he's not at home. Han is trying to figure out his life with his girlfriend while Tej and roman are making it rain dollar bills and Euros. things change and they're all called when high stakes blow out in Moscow. After that, you will be treated to some junk CGI stunts including crazy armored cars, tanks, monster airplanes and an insane leap that is more suited to a superman movie but still entertaining. however, the movie comes short in dialogue and plot.

SERIOUSLY WHO WROTE THE SCRIPT??

And How on earth did it make it to production? A first grader can collaborate with a three year old and write a better story using crayons on a drawing book. Is it that bad? YES!!!

In fact,the script was so bad that it made the actors look stupid. And this is a top drawer cast we're talking about. I'm not going to attempt to point out each of the thousand plot holes but allow me to appeal to common sense. -What if the British government people decided not to be stupid and let an international threat walk away from custody because some chick was kidnapped (plus with no guarantee of her safety). -What if the crew members decided that they're millionaires and they wont be willing to risk their lives again so Dom and Letty have a notebook reunion? -More importantly, what if governments decided they should prevent a disaster using trained operatives and secret service instead of a group of runaway carjackers? And people, this must go down on record as the longest runway ever built in history. But still, grab a popcorn and enjoy the stunts because that is all the movie is good for. and there's a good twist of events in the end that makes the two hours spent sitting there worthwhile, a tiny bit. try not cry over spending your money to watch it. I did. Far as script goes, this is AWFUL AND TERRIBLE AND AWFUL. as a screenwriter myself, it makes me sad whatHollywood is coming to. -Plus The Cop is a bad cop? like wow!!! After she looked sooo.. serious about destroying Michelle rodriguez. Why did they fight, if they were on the same team? Forcing the plot twist, you think?

And the movie got a 7.3 rating. please kill me right now, I mean right now.",mttafesse,8/11/13,2013
389,8,Summer Popcorn Movie,"I saw ""Fast & Furious 6"", starring Vin Diesel-XXX , Pitch Black, Dwayne Johnson-Pain & Gain, Tooth Fairy, Michelle Rodriguez-Machete, Resident Evil, Luke Evans-Immortals, Clash of the Titans-2010 and Gina Carano-Haywire, Blood and Bone.

Sometimes sequels will run out of steam as they go along and sometimes they continue to be watchable. This one is more than just watchable, it's still a summer popcorn movie. It is action packed with over the top stunts-jumping from moving cars to other moving cars, for example, not too believable, but fun to watch- but it also concentrates on the characters. Luke plays the bad guy here, a terrorist that is tearing up different countries in his pursuit of a weapon that will make him rich. Dwayne is the super-cop on his tail, but he is always one step behind him. Dwayne decides to enlist Vin and his team to help catch Luke. Oh yeah, Michelle-who supposedly died in an earlier movie-returns and she is working for Luke-it is explained how she pulled that off in flashbacks. Gina plays Dwayne's new partner and if you have ever seen Gina in action-see Haywire-then you know she can fight. Gina and Michelle have a couple of good dust-ups. There is a scene right after the credits start that perfectly sets up the next movie, introducing a major actor as a bad guy-I am a big fan of his. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, language and sexuality-no nudity and has a running time of 2 hours & 10 minutes. I really enjoyed this one and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",stevendbeard,5/24/13,2013
390,8,Fast 6,"I'll admit I was always a fan of the Fast and Furious series, but I wasn't a true lover of the series until it was revamped in 2009 with Fast & Furious; from there the series took off and became bigger and better.With that, Fast Six was a great flick don't get me wrong, the action, the story, and the cars were great, but I feel the movie was slightly too long and dragged out. I feel if they stuck to the pace of Fast Five, the film would have been perfectThe Pros: The cars were great! The actors sexy and believable and the action bigger and better than the predecessors.The sets amazing! had this been a straight racing movie, I feel the film would have fallen flat and not been as great.The Cons: The story had potential, it made sense and was definitely obtainable, having said that the story had too much going on that made the film jump around and wasn't cohesive. The action while amazing, was insane and probably would never happen in a real life setting (still was amazing to watch).Regardless of the cons that didn't float my boat, I still loved the movie and it was a pleasure to watch, i'm super stoked for Fast 7, if you want a taste of Fast 7 go watch Fast 6, enjoy a great car action movie and have a good time.",nflores342,6/1/13,2013

392,1,"Insulting to one's intelligence, CGI action lame!","There's a lot of things I can say about this, none of them complimentary, but who has the time? Instead I will restrict myself to a few questions I hope someone may answer, so I can maybe have a better appreciation for this mess.

1. Is an army commander allowed to give orders that put the lives of entire nations at risk in order to save his own skin, such as happened when whatever-his-rank-was had a gun to his head by Hobbs, so as to let the bad guy go, so as to possibly save the spouses of those two guys who can't act? Not to mention the troops heavily outnumbering our so-called heroes plus the bad guy. 2. Once he was let go (the baddie at the army base scene), why did they immediately try to recapture him. I mean they had him, then let him go, then immediately tried to recapture him without there being any change in the situation as far as they knew. Did I miss a key detail somewhere there? 3. If a properly forewarned army base is not able to defend itself against a bunch of thieves, what's the point of having such a base? Couldn't they call reinforcements just in case? 4. Why send the worlds most dangerous chip out with the world's most smallest convoy? 5. Why did the baddie put up with such a flaming red security risk in the person of Toretto's presumed-dead-but-alive girlfriend Letty? Why not put a bullet through her head soon as Toretto starts pitching up? Why believe in amnesia? It's not like you can see it. 6. On a related note, the Letty character was actually a genuine baddie. Why was it assumed that we sympathized with her?

There's so many other questions but honestly I don't have the energy.",samkaysam,8/19/13,2013
393,8,A blast!,"This movie was a blast! It was an action packed, humor thrilled action film with cool stunts and fights. The way the characters are laid out and used in the film is how Joss Whedon would use his character in a TV series he would make. My Example being Firefly. This is a prequel to a few of the previous films, though I will admit I lost track of the order. However plot and characters and all of those tie ins with the other movies wasn't too much of a concern since I went into this movie to watch an action packed thrill ride that would take some time out of my night, and then help me sleep and dream about fast cars and beautiful women. It's not as good as Fast Five 5, but its just as entertaining.",jayore3,5/25/13,2013
394,8,Action Packed,"Lots of action here from start to finish. The story plot I thought was better in fast 5 but Fast 6 doesn't disappoint with it's ambitious action scenes. Undoubtedly the scene that got the biggest pop from the crowd was the second ending. The ending after the credits but thats saying a lot considering we saw a full slobber-knocker scene with Michelle Rodriguez and the MMA chick, a ambitious air plane scene, and insane highway-bridge sequence. Oh yeah...we still got to see some cars and some hot girls with daisy dukes on.THis franchise definitely got better as time went on...a welcome change since usually most movie franchises go down the drain.",jfm358-88-873130,6/8/13,2013

But one must appreciate the one liners which keep us interested always. All in all may be we expected too much.But tanks , planes shooting it reminds me of THE EXPANDABLE rather that a F&F sequel. The director is giving a good into to the 7th of the series with a nice ending making it something good .

397,9,All around great film!,"I think this one is the best in the series! It has action fast cars and great stunts. The franchise is just going to get better and better. I would make one change and that is to return to its roots, Drag racing and a bit less circuit racing. Don't get me wrong I love the movie but Drag racing is just so much more exciting. I was really pleased with the return of Michelle Rodríguez, I love her character. The car selection is great from the Nissan Skyline to the '74 Ford Escort RS2000. The casting is great all my favourite actors and actresses are back and looking good. The fight scenes where very well choreographed and very entertaining. And the way the audience is told about Letty was very well planned out and brilliantly executed.",stefantheron3,5/27/13,2013
399,8,Michelle Rodriguez and Gina Carano worth the price of admission,"For those who've watched all six of the episodes, we have to admit that the second and third instalments were a let down from the initial and innovative first of the run (pun intended). When the fourth instalment reunited the Dominic Toretto and Brian O'Connor characters, along with some of the old gang, things started picking up again and the stage was set for the next two (and third 2014) episodes which are the most interesting and fun ones to watch thus far.

In episode five, the addition of Dwayne Johnson to the series, and the setting in Rio, made for the best improvement and comeback of a series yet, in my opinion. The family, extended kind of course, loyalty theme came into its own as originally championed in the very first movie and the prospect of the next episode with much of the full crew promised to be a winner; it is.

The action and the twists we come to almost predict, is present just like the fans want it. The return of Letty, played by Michelle Rodriguez was a welcome site, even if the character has lost memory of the past, the spunk and sensual appeal of the character is there in fine form. What I didn't expect was the addition (unfortunately it's only for this one episode) of Gina Carano. Carano has the credentials to play the action part her role required and she delivers very well. By the way, if you haven't seen her starring role in the movie Haywire, 2011, rent it.

Watching Carano and Rodriguez go at it not once but twice in no holds barred fight scenes was for me worth the price of admission. There are more fight scenes in this sequel of Fast & Furious than in previous ones; not that one would let the presence of Dwayne Johnson go to waste, right. We are also sort of spoiled because in the sixth episode, the action and story take place in more than one country. Watch the previous one before you catch this one; they go very well together.",JohnRayPeterson,6/11/13,2013
400,4,Most Ridiculous Film I've Seen All Year,"I've rated this a 6, because it is well made, the visuals, cgi and effects are all well done, they clearly made good use of the budget they had. It's saturated, contrasty and glossy.

However, it is single handedly the most ridiculous film I've seen this year. The story line is OK, it's your standard naughty boys after some top secret tech. But the stunts in it are just unbelievable.

When you make a film in a specific genre, there are constraints to that genre. You don't get alien spaceships flying around London in Bond films and you don't get scenes of real life snuff in Finding Nemo. But in FF6 they over stepped the acceptable mark. This could easily pass as an X Men film the way some of the scenes are played out. The characters are indestructible, there is no ""protocol"" - basically American police come to England and start pulling guns and violence on officials whilst making their demands all whilst American civilians are allowed to wonder the city shooting automatic weapons without so much as an eyelid bat - and there are more plot holes than an 24 hour Syfy film.

Whilst the film does the typical americanism of portraying the British police as bumbling fools who are easily beaten up - probably a poke at us not all carrying guns - they do portray London very well indeed. On the subject of police, it's quite hilarious to see these ""street racers"" in some of the worlds fastest most powerful cars, screaming down the streets with their lives on the line, with the London police cars tailing them by only a matter of meters.

So yeah, the portrayal of London was very nicely done and there is a scene or two showing a lot of armed response police which makes a change.

There's one women who I particularly liked, she had a big bag of balls and a great mma fighting style.

The only other thing that stood out was Ludicrous' acting which was a lot more toned down and believable, instead of the usual ""nigga you be trippin on ma wraps up in her'"".

Amongst other things, and trying to avoid spoilers, they have the worlds longest runway, chasing an aeroplane as it takes off for about 30 minutes which also climbs at a rate of about 10cm a minute - if that. They have a tank that vapourises EVERY car it touches - apart from the American protagonists which it just pushes along. And these people can repeatedly jump great heights / several stories high and hit the floor (or moving car) without a scratch. If they shot a scene where the Rock jumped from the moon and landed in a 2ft swimming pool in Iceland, it wouldn't look out of place in this film.

And that's what ruins it, it just goes WAY too far.

If you like ridiculously over the top unbelievable films, you'll love FF6. But they really do push things WAY over the line from ""maybe plausible"" to just being a complete joke.",Cinobite17,11/16/13,2013
401,9,Its Fast and Furious 006...but its 007 they're aiming for!,"We here in London are getting it a week early as a present for it being shot here.

The ""Fast and Furious"" is one of those surprisingly long lasting pulp B- series that alongside ""Underworld"" ""Resident Evil"", ""Mission Impossible"" and ""Scary Movie"" are now into their second decade and umpteempth instalment. All of those have become family cottage industries for the reoccurring cast and crew, rather like the greatest long runner of them all James Bond, and it is a good advertisement for what this kind of ""house"" production style can achieve as opposed to the more cynical quick cash grab approach taken by bottom line studios and their disinterested hacks.

When the first ""FF"" came out in 2001 it was an intimate family-crime drama based around the then unknown Street Racing scene, with a couple of chases and races but mainly stayed on 2 legs. A dull sequel came in 2004 then a totally separate story strand in 2006 which nonetheless showed the technical competence of director Justin Lin and writer Chris Morgan, who became entrusted by the returning original cast (whose expected great careers had never really materialised!) with the transformation of the series into a sort of ""Avengers"" or ""Mission Impossible"" on wheels, a team of recurring characters who take on the big crime bosses street racer way. In that form we now have the 6th movie and 3rd ""re-launch"" instalment.

The trailers tell you pretty much the whole story & there is little to spoil here. Agent Hobbes (Dwayne Johnson) comes knocking to the team's door with the promise of pardons if they help bring down a crew of dangerous ex-British and Russian special forces operatives headed by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) with the added enticement of the presumed dead Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) alive and well and running with them. Seems she did not die in ""Fast N'Furious"" but merely lost her memory in a classic case of plot convenient amnesia and was reshaped by Shaw, who was working with FNF's Mexican drug cartel villain Campos at the time, into his number 1 deadly driver girl. So the crew ups and moves to London where Shaw and co are stealing components for a deadly ""Goldeneye"" style EMP bomb that they will sell to the highest bidder or else! Cue chases and fist fights in Mayfair, Canary Wharf, Kings Cross, Piccadilly, Camden, Waterloo, and Battersea, even down the Underground, all great fun for Londoners like us after ""Skyfall"", and a nice touch of exotic foreignness for World audiences. The third act takes place in Spain, where a deadly battle on the suspended motorways of Las Canarias against a hijacked Tank gives way to a final showdown on and around a Russian Antonov transport plane attempting take off.

This unashamedly 007-esque climax appropriately tops off what is really a Spy adventure with the team working with the intelligence services to stop an evil villain and his high-tech scheme, making it different from the previous instalment (Oceans 11 in Rio) and the one before that (Revenge in Mexico). Same beats different set up � The key to a good franchise!

The film has several big action set pieces, starting with chase between the team in black BMWs trying vainly to capture Shaw and co in London, followed by a gun battle in Elephant & Castle and a nasty girl fight between the 2 toughest chicks around, Michelle Rodriguez and Gina Carano,(making good on Soderbergh's gamble to launch her as an action star) in the confined corridors of the Tube station. The Street racing roots are acknowledged with a car show-street race between Dom and Letty from Green Park through Piccadilly Circus to Battersea power station, then the Las Canarias tank-car battle, and eventually the airport- Antonov climax. All are slick and exciting, at least for those who enjoy exotic cars going fast.

The cast of returnees are all excellent, though some show fatigue, mainly Sung Kang's Han and Gal Gadot's Giselle, supposedly lovers but obviously not of this franchise anymore! Jordana Brewster's Mia has her baby and promptly misses out on most of the rest of the movie, as does previous love interest Brazilian cop Elena (Elsa Pataky) who becomes the spare wheel once Letty turns up (She is very noble and dignified about it of course). Evans is hardly tough guy material, but is actually surprisingly convincing as a cold blooded SAS hard man, reminiscent of Robert Shaw's Brit mercenary in ""Taking of Pelham 123"", while his crew is composed of generic stereotypes like evil Asian dude, big heavy Russian, cute blonde but vicious Russian girl, evil bald guy, evil bald black guy and evil handsome black guy. Carano does well in a supporting role, not having to carry a movie as she bravely attempted in last year's ""Haywire"", and her muscular brawn sets her well apart from the other supposedly tough chicks. Even Rodriguez is outmatched by a woman twice her size, but uses dirty tricks to even the odds in their various encounters.

This instalment is good dirty fun, and delivers what its inspiration, the 007 series, used to before they decided that it was all somehow beneath them (good luck on the future there guys!) The ending returns to the series roots, with the Toretto's Italian-American family values at play in a round table barbecue, but of course it won't end there, not yet at least.

The ending, which retcons ""Tokyo Drift"" (which finally happens in this continuity) sees the arrival of a new adversary for episode 7 � The Transporter!

Roll on Fast and Furious 7 � And along with Mission Impossible take 007's mantle and give us something to look forward to in a couple of years time!",s_campanale,5/17/13,2013
402,8,My First F&F Film and I Liked It!,"I have not seen a single installment of the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, one of only a few, I am sure. I never got around to watching the first one at all, consequently I never did get to watch the second, nor any of the five. There was very big buzz about the last one ""Fast Five,"" but unfortunately I was not able to catch it. Now, this time, since Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez made the effort to come over to our country and grace this film's Premiere here last week (the first Hollywood premiere in Manila). I made it a point to watch ""F&F 6"", and I'm glad I did.Now I see what the fuss was all about, and why this franchise has lasted this long and still goes strong. The car chase scenes, on which this franchise's fame lay, were amazingly planned, executed, shot and edited. There was that chase scene on the freeway with a tank, ending with a superhuman midair rescue you simply have got to see. As if that is not enough, the entire last sequence was about cars trying to get a Russian cargo plane from taking off, all the while fighting off the enemies mostly mano a mano. I commend director Justin Lin for these ace pieces of action direction.In between these big action sequences, there are the scenes of the team led by Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker) talk about about being a family and never leaving anybody out. Among the members of the gang, Tyrese Gibson stood out as the loquacious Roman, the film's main source of comic relief. His funny one-liners also came fast and furiously hilarious. Matching big and beefy Vin Diesel is big and beefy Dwayne Johnson. The Rock plays a cop, Agent Hobbs, who sought help from Dom's and his team in apprehending another team of mercenary drivers doing terrorist errands led by Owen Shaw (played by Luke Evans). In return for their help, they asked Hobbs to work for their amnesty so they can all go back to the States, instead of hiding in countries without extradition as they are now. The unexpected return of Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who was apparently thought to have been killed in a previous episode but now was working with the enemy, provides dramatic focus for the characters, particularly Dom. Overall this is one very entertaining and exhilarating film, which I understood and appreciated well even if I have not seen any of the previous films. Well, I am sure fans who have seen all the movies will love it even more than I did since they have known and loved all these characters already. The top-notch action sequences left nothing to be desired, really breath-taking. These heart-stopping stunts are all admittedly downright ridiculous and impossible, but that was why they were all so awesome to watch.",3xHCCH,5/24/13,2013
403,8,Has good as Fast Five,"Agent Hobbs(Dwayne Johnson) is hot on the trail of a gang of ruthless hijackers led by Shaw(Luke Evans) in London, and this gang is too clever, they always manage to stay two steps ahead of the law. So Hobbs figures you need criminals to catch criminals. So Hobbs ask for Toretto(Vin Diesel) and gang for help, and promises them full pardons if they succeed.The action is incredible, so where the characters, everybody plays off themselves perfectly. Luke Evans is calm, cool, villain. Dwayne Johnson really owns things up in all most every scene he's in. Vin Diesel is entertaining has Toretto. But it's Tyrese Gibson who steals the show has the nitwit of the group. It does have good fight scenes, and the car chase scenes are pretty intense.",DarkVulcan29,5/27/13,2013
408,2,Just plain silly,"Doesn't seem to understand a Jenson Interceptor is NOT an American Muscle car, went down hill from there.

Also gotta be the longest runway in the world by ohh about 3 major sized countries I look for action films which stretch the imagination - this was just stoopid. This Franchise should have stopped at #3 Tokyo Drift. I don't mind that Li tries to mess with the sequence of the movies - but I do care when he gets its badly wrong. #6 is definitely the low point in the franchise.

409,8,Damn it's furious!,"Sometimes you wonder why people watch movies in the first place. More and more I hear people bitch and moan and are critical for all the wrong reasons. Normally I encourage criticism but in this case I honestly feel the need to smack around to slap some sense back in to them. First of all The Fast and the Furious was never a film with cinematic values so high that it would challenge you or change your mindset. That it did rock some people's world was because of it's awesomeness. I know someone who got into auto tuning because of it. All his well earned money went into his car. Must have driven some parents or wives completely insane.That the Fast and The Furious had impact is a given. But let's get real. It wasn't really an intelligent movie. It was just fun and pure adrenalin. The fourth entry in the franchise for me was a sign that they needed to stop because it was nowhere near fast or furious. The fifth changed my mind and now this latest part rocked my world again. So how come a lot of people seem to be very critical all of a sudden? Exactly what were they expecting? Fast and Furious 6 is a non stop no nonsense high octane blockbuster action movie that delivers! This sixth entry is pure fan service. It has a little of everything from all the parts in the franchise. OK,there is less racing and more brutal and over the top stunts and action. How is that seen as a problem? Isn't that what we expect from a blockbuster? Hell yes! Complaining about plot and character development. Are you kidding? Sorry for getting worked up here. But see I enjoyed this film from beginning till end in such a way that I am actually looking forward to the seventh entry. I was so against any sequel made after the first two but have become a believer. Which is very rare I might add. Are there really no points I am critical about? Sure I have some points. But they aren't huge enough because this film is never pretentious. It knows it is being ridiculous and revels in it. There are many little nods back and forth to the other parts which makes it fun for the fans who have seen every part. It is also one of the few sequels where it is required to have seen previous parts otherwise you will just scratch your head and don't get the jokes (which I assume is a large group of the reviewers who complained about this one). Do yourself a favour don't act like a grandpa or grandma and let go of if a certain event is possible or not. It's a movie not reality. Fast and Furious 6 is a movie that is one of the best action movies in a long time so go watch it.",chrichtonsworld,7/24/13,2013
410,9,Faster than Five,"This movie was by far the best installment of the series. Dwayne Johnson does an excellent job returning as Hobbs to rival the size of Vin Deisal in a battle of bravado. Seeing them as allies truly makes one feel invincible. The only issue with the movie is that the villain, Shaw, is slightly less believable than previous villains. The actors voice is perhaps, too mild to pass as pure evil and the evil plans really aren't going anywhere. Perhaps this was a build up character for the evil brother of Shaw who is to become the villain of Fast 7. Other than this minor flaw, the cars, the women, the actors, the action, the romance, unexpected deaths, and the drama add up to make Furious 6 a 9 star movie for me.",garyguitarking,6/12/13,2013
411,9,Not Out of Milk Just Yet,"This movie has all the elements going for it than the previous film, much more emotionally involving because it's moral of family really reaching the audience. This flick consists of intense stunts that will stun the audience as well as surprisingly more exciting stunt driving. Humour wise, they solidified Tyrese Gibson as their comedic symbol churning up most of the laughs. The intro credit scene is as always attention grabbing, with a scene after the ending credits to predict another sequel. This franchise still seems fresh due to all the Fast and Furious films not having generic plots, it is not out of originality/milk yet. There are twists that will for sure surprise you and the performances are in no way stale for a pretty dumb action flick. Even though you've seen all the trailers there are still unexpected shocks. The music score is extremely modern and ""hip"" that brings every scene alive, I already have some of the soundtracks in my play list. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson again reassures the public for the 4th time this year that he is a force to be reckoned with action star. With a very epic climax it truly delivers high octane entertainment to all of it's hardcore fans. This is an extremely satisfying pre-summer flick that still has a kick-ass future ahead of it.",DMurill23,5/24/13,2013
412,5,"Jumble, Mumble, Okay at times, Yet Mess, What Acting?","The story has been repeated multiple times with various movies. The acting needs a lot of work. Jason Statham shows at the end for an upcoming lead to a sequel. His acting out shined everyone even though his part was minimal. I rather see Jason as a good guy rather than a bad guy. Vin Diesel looked a little chubby around the face and needs to hit the gym or diet a bit better. It seems the Rock tries to hide his limited acting with his perpetually pumped wannabe Arnold's biceps. Paul Walker's acting was good. Tyrese's part added comedy, however, his acting ranked a little better than the Rock's. Sung's expressionless acting worked. Michelle Rodriguez acting was okay but I've seen a lot better performances by her in other shows. Character development needed more work and better acting needs to occur. The special effects existed however, we found ourselves daydreaming, bored, and unimpressed because the visuals kept repeating endlessly and pointlessly. The climax with the cargo plane had amazing special effects but seemed as it would never end. It became boring and ridiculous. World's longest runway? The movie ranks a bit higher than the latest Die Hard. Is it worth to see? Maybe.",ronshav,5/25/13,2013
413,8,As brilliant as the 5th,"Here the brilliant means many things, the pictures, the driving, the pretty girls, the cars, and the friendship.Following the last one of this series, the 6th shows us a new competition which will be the conflict between two professional criminal team rather than our drivers and the police. The plots of the 6th are awesome but also not perfect just like its brothers, however, this kind of movies aim at showing us the dazzled cars and driving skills. There is not a big flaw I can easily find during the whole projecting, maybe it is because I paid most of my attention to the sexy girls, the cars and the extremely cool driving.At least, one thing I am sure is that this kind of film would not step into the academic awards, but it can be popular among the world, can attract plenty of fans following the series year by year. That's it, no need for anything else.For the last point I mentioned at the beginning - friendship, it is the most valuable element in this kind of movie, it's not surprise that the film like this can also teach us something important. It can be a inspiration for those directors struggling in making junk every day. So, just ust think about it dude.",JolinKnight,7/7/13,2013
417,10,Amazing. (Just a quick review),"Im not going to talk too much about the film and I only have a few words.Amazing!! To start off with, from beginning to end, the film sucks you in and engages you in. The film has a serious enough plot but with the character Roman, the film manages to have its comedy element throughout. Decent story line and a good build up to the final 40 minutes of the film which is all action pretty much. Overall. The performances were great, the action was spectacular. Just a fun film to watch. So my final rating. 5/5 Stars. (10/10)Other FF movie rating's by me. The fast and the furious, 4 and a 1/2 out of 5 stars. 2fast 2furious 3/5 stars. Tokyo drift 3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars.

422,8,"Fast, Furious, and Fun!","The crew have gotten $100M from the last movie two years ago due to stealing from a kingpin. But they are on the run. And that they can't return back to the USA if they set foot, they will be arrested asap.

But Luke Hobbs the fed, played by the Rock Dwayne Johnson who has developed from the first time we saw him, gets a partner in Gina Carano's Riley as she has some acting skills. But something has come up.

There Brian played by Paul Walker and his girlfriend, played by Jordana Brewster now of the new Dallas, are new parents to a boy. And Vin Diesel's Dom is now the boyfriend of the cop that was trailing him in the last movie.

Hobbs manages easily to track down our heroes, as Luke Evans, the main antagonist in this movie, is a former special forces soldier turned ruthless mercenary and to top it all off, Dom's former love Letty, played by Michelle Rodriguez who thought was dead in the fourth film. Is involved with Evans! Is back but with no memory of her own. As Hobbs if he gets Dom and the team needs to be reunited in order to take Evans and his team down. In return, our heroes to get full pardons and returning back to the USA without threat.

424,3,Haven't been this bored in a long time,"Im not a big fan of the Fast & Furious movies, but some of them are OK, and i went to the cinema because my girlfriend wanted to see this. I thought this one got good rating and heard from friends that it was a pretty good movie. I went to the cinema all ready with my snacks and drink thinking i'll have a good time based on the ratings from IMDb which i most of the time agree with. Although, this time i was very disappointed, what i thought when the movie begin and started to know what it all was about i thought ""oh no are they going to recap from previous movies?"" going back to an old character that all of the sudden is alive, surprise! From that moment on, i just thought things couldn't get any worse.. The nonstop shooting from cars and Vin diesel sounds ridiculous, i almost couldn't hear what he said if it wasn't for the subs, he sounded so stupid trying to sound so tough i almost laughed at him right at the spot. I was sitting at the cinema feeling this itch in my body i just wanted to run around all the chairs, i had to finish it though so i could rate it. This movie was a huge disappointment, wont ever pay for a ticket to another Fast & furious movie again it's gone far enough they don't have creative writers enough i don't get how people can enjoy this movie.",LLinus,7/11/13,2013
425,8,They're not deep but they're fun movies...,"I'll just say it; I think these movies are just fun. I never really tire of them. Sure, some of the action is ridiculous�stupid even�and the characters are one-dimensional. Sure, some of the acting is hammy and cheesy and much of what happens not just laughs in the face of physics but actually punches physics in the gut before it runs away with its girlfriend only to leave her behind at the first gas station it comes across BUT, despite all these factors, these movies are massive guilty pleasures for me and ""Fast and Furious 6"" is just another fun addition.

I watch these movies because they are just action, octane and testosterone thrown into a blender and set to puree. The fast cars, the exciting action and the pointless, impossibly attractive women who seem to inhabit this clearly fictional world are all here and why this movie is not watched for narrative, character nuances or even plot or story. ""Furious 6"" appeals to the primitive desire to see things blow up and see cars go super fast�and that's why I think these movies are fun.

My only complaint was the decision to bring Michelle Rodriguez back to the franchise (I think she's a terrible actress who can't play the one character she is constantly typecast into playing) and the decision to add Gina Carano to the cast (like Rodriguez, Carano can't act to save her life; the exception being she is a million times worse than Rodriguez); however, the presence of The Rock (let's face it, the dude just bleeds cool) and a decent antagonist in the form of Luke Evans, my complaints are non-existence�plus, more cars drive fast and things go boom, so ignoring Rodriguez and Carano is easy.

""Fast & Furious 6"" is just a wild, action-packed thrill ride that keeps reminding us why these movies make money.

426,9,All thats promised,"Sometimes trailers are fast and original movie fails to deliver. This time, its not the case. Fast 6 is exactly what it promises to be. Fast, Stylish, Crafty and Intelligent. From the montage video in the title song (We Own It) including important scenes from all the movies (except Tokyo Drift) - the series finally connects Tokyo Drift to Fast 5. The stunt scenes including the tank are one of the best ones I have seen ever. And the emotional side of Vinn Diesel is one of the best. Its sad that they took Han and Gisele out of the equation, since they are one of the coolest people in the movie. This movie is definitely the finest Fast and Furious Movie ever. Loved it. Must Watch.",vish2407,6/30/13,2013
427,8,Nice Tie in To the other fast and furious movies,"First off let me say i can't in good conscience give this movie a 10 because there is one scene in the movie they could have did a bit better. I will not spoil it for others, go see it and decide for yourself. However, I still give the movie a good review because it met my expectations: Good Action Flick, It gives you more insight on the character Hans and I felt it tied up some of the past fast and furious films together. The other fast and furious films now make more sense as an extended story after watching this latest one. The ending of the movie definitely set the franchise up for more films and I hope they continue to do good on building the storyline. Now to the critics, It is very terrible that i have read some reviews and see some people say i would give the movie a 6 but to balance the reviews that are higher than they should be I'm going to give it a 1. That is the most retarded crap i ever heard and it is those people that are making the review system faulty. Rate the movie based on how you really feel about it. You are not helping anyone make an educated decision on taking a chance to go and see the film. I feel its an eight because they built more on the storyline compared to the past fast and furious films and i also felt there was good chemistry between the actors and I really enjoyed it. Yes the movie has some faults but overall it is an enjoyable film.",icheckcheckers,7/7/13,2013
428,1,"7,5 rating? This is not good","for the IMDb users community. To give a 7,5 stars to a movie full of clichés, bad acting, kid written plot and a full bucket (or a sea) of flaws is a insult to this community. Except the making of the stunts (the making, not the idea of it) the whole movie is a mess. At one moment you will think that you skipped a part of the movie: not, the script is completely chaotic. But this is democracy: unfortunately everybody can vote. Gosh, Tarkovski's ""Mirror"" got 7.9 stars! I watch this movie with a friend and we laugh like we did it to ""Naked gun"" or ""Hot shots!"" series. And this was a good news for the ""Furious 6"" if it was a parody. But is not.

430,8,Got caught up to see what the hype was about...,"Thoroughly enjoyed this film. Totally unbelievable at times, but it's a movie for entertainment purposes. Not a documentary.I had never seen a F&F movie, so I got the DVDs (except for the Tokyo one; heard it was not so hot). I enjoyed 1, 2, 4 and 5 so I was expecting to enjoy 6. Did I ever. I love the fast cars, the sorta over-the-top machismo of the guys and the idea of family. Taking the movies from the racing scene to heists, etc. is an interesting maturing of the franchise. How many race motives can you come up with to stay interesting and relevant? Getting into the heist-action is a good turn, I think. The guys/girls are growing up and it's nice to see some change while keeping in the great fast car scenes. Dwayne Johnson is too much (in a good way) and he seems like more of a caricature of a man. He's just so dang big and ""hulking"" over anyone else. But that just adds to the fun of the movie.The photography is so good - to my eye it's flawless (and I'm always on the lookout for those details about the scene that are missed between ""cut"" and ""action""). The character development is maturing, too, as we get to know these guys through the years. The funny lines are good and some are so small & quick, you might miss 'em.Looking forward to 7 - I love it when you get involved in a movie franchise where you look forward to seeing your ""friends"" again. This is one of those for me.",coastdaze,6/10/13,2013
434,9,Can't Wait for #7,"I am a huge fan of The Fast and The Furious Series. The movie was very good because 'Epic' bits to parts of the film where it seemed unrealistic.

I feel that Fast Five seemed a bit better because it seemed more realistic. In the ending moments there was a runway scene which went on for ages another was that Dom acted like Superman about 5/7th of the way through the film.

It was a very good film and no wonder it is the 2nd Highest Grossing Film of 2013. The story line of the film was very good as we knew towards the start that they had to take down as 'Bad Person'. Music by Lucas Vidal was very good, especially 'We Own It' and 'Bandoleros'. Justin Lin has been a very good Director for the main part of the Series except for Tokyo Drift which has been the worst in the series and will be sad that James Wan takes over to direct the 7th one, however we can only hope that he takes the series to even greater heights for the Big Finale.

I am so pleased to say that the movie exceeded any of my existing expectations and did some things I didn't expect at all.

The Old Gang are back and they are great.. Vin was spot on, but the coup de gras was The Rock. Johnson is great in everything but he was born for this role. I think the goal of this movie was fun.

It's well written and I'd say one of the best written trilogies. They have 6 about to be 7 of these and it is still awesome. Usually sequels don't last after the third one but this one is at 6 and it is still an outstanding movie. I don't know anyone who wouldn't like this movie. I also think this it one of the best movies I've seen and I can't wait for the seventh to be released but I hope the fact that it's a different director doesn't change it in any way.

The entire star cast looks well adapted to their respective character which makes the plot more believable. The action sequences are crazy! Letty returns,makes it even crazier. Inspite of such a crowded star cast,there's no confusion whatsoever throughout the movie. Gal Gadot's tragic end is touching..so is Han's. Overall,the movie may not have such a strong storyline,but it more than makes up for it with it's soul,it's 12 year old core,superb action,great actors,crazy stunts and of course,that background score.

447,5,"Better, but far from being good.","Warning: There will be spoilers in this review, specifically one scene, that I really need to talk about.

Alright lets get facts, I liked the first three movies, I honestly can't remember what happened in the forth one, disliked extremely the 5th one and I'm at a neutral stand point on the 6th one.

Story is basically Hobbs played by Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson needs help catching a gang of terrorist who stole billions of dollars worth of Military equipment. He seeks out our main character Dominic Toretto played by Vin Diesel. (I always found it funny that his last name is Diesel.) Which is pretty much a criminal and likes to break every law out there, including laws of physics it would appear. And of course he gets the team back together after their last adventure of stealing 100 million $ to try and catch these terrorist. But why would Dom want to help a cop you might ask? Well lets just say, he saw a ghost.

Lets talked about what I liked about the movie, well the action was a lot of fun. And they had 2 races this time, (Car chases don't count as a race) Though they had a lot of those which I can't say the same for Fast 5. Needless to say they were more in a car than before, and that is what I want to see from these movies. Not a Drama Flick, which needless to say, there was a lot of that as well. It had some comedy to it that also I found enjoyable. The Characters were relate-able as well.

Now lets talk about what I didn't like about this movie. I know, just as much as anyone else who likes American movies that Hollywood, really goes the extra mile at bending laws of physics, especially when it comes to movies that are suppose to be based on reality and not fiction or fantasy. What I really don't like is when they go beyond the extra mile in racing movies like this. Purely Critic talking, you have to obey laws of physics if your going to base your movie in real time. You are using real places, real cars, in areas where things could really happen. You cannot bend the rules and make cars rip through a cockpit of an air plane.

Let me elaborate on this. The final action scene of the movie, is where the Antagonist is trying to make an escape through a moving plane, and our heroes need to stop them before they get away. THANK GOD THE RUNWAY IS AT LEAST 20+ KM LONG!!. This scene literally starts off with the Bad guys, and the good guys chasing each other on a runway, for a good 2 minutes as what I'm assuming judging by these cars 220 km/h+ then the air planes comes in, lands on movement, and we now have them trying to get in through the cargo area in the back of the air plane. They get in the plane, getting out of their cars, then fighting. Meanwhile the others are shooting these grappling guns on the wings (attempting to hit the engine). And as the plane starts to take off, it stays a the same height for another good 5 minutes not going any higher. Before you say, they were making a (meanwhile) kinda thing by going back and forth outside of the plane to where the cars were, and inside to see the fighting, shut it, it's still to freaking long! After 15 minutes of being on this runway, the Power ranger Turbo (seriously it really did make me think of that) got to bring the plane back down, and might I add that this wasn't a little power jet, no this was a beast of a plane, with like the 8 wheels. They bring the plane down, and Vin Diesel, drives literally THROUGH THE COCKPIT OF THE BLOODY PLANE MADE OUT OF STEAL, LANDS IN FRONT OF THE PLANE. Mind you he does lose control of the car, but he roles out of the way just in time.

You cannot do that. Sure it is really cool to watch, and it's all action, and most people are like ""Holy crap that is so wicked that I wanna name my first born Vin Diesel"" But you don't know better, you really don't. This isn't the kind of movie to be bending the normal laws of physics. Sure, take this story, put it in a planet called ""Nos"" then do that stuff. Non-Ficton Action flick demand to be realistic. This was the biggest scene of the movie, and I'm picking on it, because it was the worst. But they do it all over the movie. The part about the tank, and catching the girl in mid-air. There is so many things I could talk about in this movie that pisses me off when it comes to realistic. But I made my point. I'm giving this movie the rating that I'm giving it because yes it may have ticked me off with the realism, but it was fun to watch for the most part.

I give this movie a 5/10.",jason-godin232,5/28/13,2013
449,8,"Still Fast, Still Furious, Still Entertaining","Fast and Furious has become the most awkwardly successful franchise in the history of film, and the sixth installment just adds to the insanity. Since when does a Part 6 to ANY film find any success or quality? This is an underrated first in cinematic history (Star Wars: Return of the Jedi does not count) as this testosterone-laden monolith of an action flick delivers the women, cars, action, comedy, and themes of family that has become a staple to the franchise since its subtle revival in Fast and Furious.If you have enjoyed this new direction of the Fast/Furious series then there will be nothing here that will disappoint you, from the stunts to the direction to the manly cast that makes the male viewers watching this look like Steve Urkel. The plot is a simple stop-that-man tale that involves the entire cast from Fast Five as well as a couple familiar faces from previous installments, which explains the opening sequence playing out like a flashback. The rest of the movie plays out like an extremely expensive music video with likable characters and high octane action sequences attached.What keeps the motors of this movie (and franchise overall) running is the very likable cast of characters and the connection they've developed with the dedicated fanbase. Even though certain characters like Brian and Mia (Paul Walker shines but is limited) have taken less screen time and we have more focus on Dom and Luke (Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson), they each have their moments to shine and get the audience excited. The writing doesn't totally excel but it goes straight to the point of the conflict at hand and what is at stake.But the cars and what happens to them is the heart and soul of Fast 6. Justin Lin is improving as an action director as he delivers the sequences with precise camera movement, surprisingly crisp cinematography, and enough space so that you can see the sheer scale of the mayhem occurring. While Fast Five still has the ultimate action sequence in the past half-decade, the latter action scenes will leave you breathless guaranteed.This is a very you-get-what-you-paid for film, as it doesn't quite take the franchise to the next level, but maintains delivering what you've come to expect out of these films. The beautiful women will be here, as well as the buff men, the tough-as-nails action, the beautiful cars, the good soundtrack, and a pace that matches that of a car---once the engines are running it truly takes off. While there is no evolution, there is plenty of entertainment to go around for everybody willing to watch.And do stay tuned for the credits. Just when you think that eventual next installment might be overkill, you will leave the theater excited.",diac228,5/24/13,2013
451,5,Fast & Furious 6- A Consistent and Idiotic Continuation of the Franchise that Boasts Typical Adrenaline Infused Action and Stodgy Dialogue,"A key aspect in achieving success in the entertainment industry, at least in terms of obtaining a dedicated audience following, is keeping a strong sense of what defines your product's particular genre or style and confidently presenting its strengths in full force but also accepting the weaknesses presented in self-aware jest. Ever since director Justin Lin took over the Fast and Furious franchise the series has taken the route of self-aware confidence where it has embraced its strengths for nonsensical, physics defying action as well as the weakness for having leaden dialogue coming from expressionless characters and fans have been thankful for the consistency. Fast Five might have been the franchise's peak because of its tongue and cheek attitude towards its Looney Tunes environment of unrestrained adrenaline and exaggerated stunts making it difficult for any continuing sequel to match it unless the creators upgraded the storytelling parts of this clumsily custom built machine. The latest in the Fast & Furious series, eloquently named Fast & Furious 6, remains consistent to fan expectations with its fondness for stunt driven spectacle yet it exists in a plot that thinks it's far superior than it is in reality, showcasing screenwriter Chris Morgan's wrongful assumption that more dramatic breathing room between implausible action sequences gives your writing more credibility. There is an existential quandary that lives within Fast & Furious 6 as an attempt at seriousness, either in the renewed relationships or predictable plot twists, in an environment of ridiculousness practically derails this speeding vehicle from its intention on being unadulterated fun. On face and in execution the Fast & Furious films are reminiscent of experiencing a live action version of an anime cartoon (a point of view a friend of mine has reinforced) with its cartoonish embellishment of its physical environment but with far dumber plot lines and exceedingly bland dialogue so when there's less of the latter it's for the better. As guilty pleasures go there are few as technically executed as the Fast & Furious franchise and though the sixth installment showcases some of the series dumbest dialogue exchanges through purely rigid performances it remains a consistent entertainment outlet for those who have been initially conned by the fast and furious appeal.Read more: http://wp.me/py8op-yG; more reviews: generationfilm.net",generationfilm,5/25/13,2013
452,8,Pure entertainment. Faster and Furiouser,"¨You don't turn your back on family, even when they do.¨Fast and Furious 6 and The Hangover Part 3 were both released today in what looks to be a tight box office race for the Memorial Day weekend. If you would have asked me a couple of years ago which film I would prefer to see, I would have definitely chosen to go see The Hangover Part 3 because I loved the first movie and thought it was a great comedy; I also enjoyed The Fast and The Furious film but wasn't too pleased with the following three sequels. Then in 2011 when both Fast Five and The Hangover Part 2 came out, things completely changed for me. I was hooked with The Fast and Furious franchise while part two of The Hangover was a major letdown. That is why this weekend I decided to go for Fast and Furious 6 without a doubt, and I wasn't disappointed. This might not be as good as the last film (which I think is the best in the franchise), but it lived up to expectations and was highly entertaining. This is Justin Lin's fourth time in the director's chair in this franchise and he seems to have had a great effect on these movies converting them into entertaining thrillers with some great action scenes. Screenwriter, Chris Morgan, is also back for the fourth time and he has managed to actually put some brains to these fast car races and create better characters. He's developed these characters very well and made them interesting, and has also done a decent job at creating some memorable villains. The film is fast paced, has several thrills, great car chases, and some decent character development. Of course there are several flaws as well: unbelievable and laughable scenes involving guys jumping off moving vehicles and landing safely all the time, and some very predictable moments and foreseeable twists. I still had a fun time with this film and laughed more than I thought I would. If you thought that Toretto (Vin Diesel) and O'Conner (Paul Walker) were retired after their latest heist in Rio, then you were wrong because Detective Hobbs (Dwayne ¨The Rock¨ Johnson) has an interesting proposition for them. He is pursuing some dangerous criminal mercenary drivers led by Shaw (Luke Evans) who have been creating chaos all over Europe. In order to stop them, Hobbs knows that he will need the help of Toretto. Hobbs discovers that Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Toretto's former love interest, is alive and working for Shaw, and therefore convinces Toretto to help him. The rest of his crew decides to come out of retirement as well and try to bring Letty back home with them. In exchange, Hobbs promises these men full pardon, and they accept without hesitation because they are tired of running and not being able to return home. Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Chris ¨Ludicrous¨ Bridges), Han (Sung Kang), and Gisele (Gal Gadot) are all back in order to help Toretto and O'Conner to stop the ruthless criminals pursuing them from London to Spain, but Shaw and his men seem to be always a step ahead of them. This sixth film in the franchise seems to tie some loose ends from the third and fourth installment in a very thrilling and entertaining way. The franchise has really picked up and it seems to have a lot of life left in it. It even ends with a cliffhanger, so it is certain that the seventh film will be coming out soon as well. Most everyone in the franchise is back again (only missing Tego Calderon and Don Omar) and the interaction between these characters is very entertaining. Ludicrous and Tyrese pretty much steal all the laughs in the scenes they are together in, while Gadot and Kang bring in the romantic touch. Toretto and O'Conner have put aside their differences from the first films and their bond is pretty strong now as they are family. Despite some of the insane and absurd action scenes, this film stands above most other action films thanks to a strong performance from the cast. This film is really a lot of fun as long as you don't think too hard of all the physical impossibilities of what they are achieving. The franchise just continues to grow faster and faster, and it works really well for a summer blockbuster movie. Fans won't be disappointed, it is a very satisfying film. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",estebangonzalez10,5/24/13,2013
453,10,Ride to Die!,"i personally think i am the top fast & the furious fan :D.. because i really really enjoyed every bit and piece of all the main 6 movies and the 2 short movies as well. still now i put my DVDs and watch it all over again when i feel excited about something or even if i feel down. the fast & the furious series make me feel good. I love the cars, i love the car chases, races, crashes and all the actors in the series so far.

I was little bit disappointed when they bring back Han from dead in Fast & Furious (2009). But after watching this it makes perfect sense on how he died and make perfect sense about the order of the movie series.(despite the release dates)

i am not going to talk about other movies in the series, but let me first tell you generally why i think this series is so good. 1) this is pure action 2) this is about family values, love, Friendship, standing up for your loved once rather than backstabbing 3) this is about trust, broken promises, letting go, forgiving, payback 4) this is about living your dreams 5) or i forgot the best, man this is purely about cars.. cars cars cars.. there are lot of things i can think about this movie, but i let you decide.

Lets talk about Fast & Furious 6 the latest. although my favorite one is 2 fast furious i have to agree myself that this is the best movie in the series so far. it has great effects, awesome fight scenes, adrenaline packed car races, destructive car crashes, good sense of humor and a great twist and a great ending and also a great post credits scene which gives a perfect clearance to the confusions about Hans death and also signal you about the plot of the next franchise. what else do you need from a movie? also another thing i noted is they update there cars very well, they don't use old grandma type cars in the movie.

one last point, this is not the movie for twilight, harry potter, notebook fans, this is not for Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Robert Pattinson fans also.

If you loved Transporter,Expendables,Bad Boys,Danny Oceans,Rambo,Terminator,National treasure,Hancock,Lethal Weapon type movies.... yeah this is the movie for you, this is the series for you. Enjoy! CheerZ!!!",chathux10,8/3/13,2013
454,8,"The Series Remains Both Action Packed and Entertaining,","Fast and Furious 6 is a brilliant movie with a really well thought out and developed storyline and like the other movies,a very inspired cast.I didn't like it as much as Fast and Furious 5,but it is my second favourite in the franchise,after six movies their still going strong and are only improving with the cast and story.Dwayne Johnson is fantastic in this movie and I think he is one of the biggest reasons this one and the fifth are so great,he plays an even bigger role in this one and joins Dominic,Brian and the rest of the gang.The ending was probably the best part,I won't spoil it for anyone but it gave great potential for what will probably be a great seventh Fast and Furious,and for as long as Vin Diesel,Paul Walker and the rest of the cast agree to do them,i'll want to see more.Fans of the other Fast and Furious movies will be very pleased.Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) gets the help from Dominic (Vin Diesel) and Brian's (Paul Walker) crew to help track down a man who commands in several countries.",lesleyharris30,8/12/13,2013
455,3,The furious(est) movie yet,"The movie had too many logic or writing flaws for me to enjoy it. Flaws:

-Predictable double agent.

-Letti and the double agent fight early on in the movie. They are on the same side at this point since Letti hasn't defected yet (quite possible Letti does not know about the double agent, meaning that this isn't a flaw)

-They find the paint from the compound inside the base BEFORE they head to the compound

-Vin Diesel can fly

-Steroid Chef Ramsay is not a parody of actual Chef Ramsay (also predictable fight with The Rock)

-Bad guys shoot little devices onto cars that: a) can override a motor b)are for whatever reason not packed with an explosive charge (they even had a remote to trigger them)

-The trip wire guns shoot chunks of metal into rock so hard that the wire stops an entire armoured truck from moving yet has little to no recoil

-They have vending machines in their super secret covert hidden base(those things are kept track of)

-The convoy to hide the chip from the bad guys known for using fast cars to do their work consisted of slow cars

-The convoy did not consist of a helicopter

-There was a tank inside the truck.

-The tank was armed and unmanned.

-The runway was a million friggen miles long

-Tokyo drift's girlfriend died predictably (it was predictable because they settled their conflict too early)

-Predictable wife kidnapping

-After sniper showdown Shaw drives away. Vin stands there and does nothing as The Rock leaves his sniper post to join him. They are both at the mercy of other sniper who does not shoot them for whatever reason.

-Super bad-ass antagonist Shaw is killed by freak accident. Very unsatisfying.

-Jeeps drive as fast as a plane can fly.

-Vin catches Letti in the air and completely reduces her speed rather than exploding into a rain of gore.

-Vin drives his car from the storage part of the plane out the cockpit

These are just the ones I can remember from the 20 minutes I spent on this. In short, this is a movie for dumb people. On the more optimistic side, the cars went fast, the ladies were buxom, and the fights were pretty cool. Did I mention steroid Ramsey? If you want a good rental to watch with a couple of buddies, this is it. If you want to feel stimulated, go watch something else.",lord-of-frogs,5/28/13,2013
456,10,All eyes lead to this!,"More than a decade has passed since the first ""Fast & Furious"", still like all series this one calls for whistles, applause and OMG moments.Now, the movie sort of takes start from where it let off in the last flick. But the comparison ends then and there, this is a whole new thing.Kudos to Justin Lin for making such a fantastic movie with an amazing star cast and not to forget the beautiful yet brawny CARS. This movie is much more than an eardrum tearing acceleration sounds or big muscled people delivering punchy dialogues, this movie is more emotional yet full of action. If you thought Fast & Furious 4 was emotional, you need to see this one. All actors did their job wonderfully as expected.This is definitely one flick you should watch if you are a Fast & Furious series fan and if you are not then give it a try, you are bound to watch all of the series then. Brilliant flick, just plain brilliant.And at last there are two things worth mentioning that would increase your appetite for this movie:- (i) The scene where Dom save Letty's life is breathtaking. (ii) Do not leave your seat when the movie ends, this too like the last one has a BIG surprise.Enjoy the torque!!",siddharthkrishnadwivedi,5/26/13,2013
458,8,"I wanted to hate the movie, but I've enjoyed it quite a bit","There have been interesting Furious films, there have been really bad ones and there have been good ones. The sixth part of the franchise is immensely ambitious in terms of special effects and body count, it features all the actors in the previous films, cool machines, scary villain (British, of course) and, against my better judgement, was fun! So in terms of car chase films, it was one of the better ones.This doesn't mean it was perfect. High speed chases through London, tanks killing tens of people by driving over cars, the damn American movie arithmetic that counts a victory the saving of a main character over a lesser one and the huge amount of physical violence that has to not show blood in order to be OK... all of these made me cringe at times. Also some one liners, but that was to be expected.So it is a viewer choice if the movie is good or not. Mainly it is a gang fight between ""professional criminals"", only some are uselessly cruel while the others are ""family"". I am not going to even go into tribal irony here, but you know what I mean.Bottom line: rated it above average for a movie of its kind. The music was not memorable in any way, as in other films. The chases were flamboyant, but not really focused on driver skill except a few of them. Simple, high budget movie, lacking substance, but fun.",siderite,7/5/13,2013
459,4,Entertaining for teenagers .. forgettable,"Hello everone I hope this my short review on this movie will help you to decide watch it or not. First to say this movie will attract younger audience who seeks lots of destruction, chicks and nice cars..

Those who want a action movie with little reallity wont find this move interesting

This film has moved a little in wrong direction since first one...its not based on street racing and cars but are heroos are now specialist on weapons, some sort of super anti terroristic crew...hehe that is funny but who cares..thats the way it is...

there are many scenes like in mission impossible...I thought I am watching some kind of cartoon! Thats one of the biggest reasons I am giving this film 4 out of 10

The scene with the tenk on highway when Leti is flying towards Toreto over the cliff and they grab each other on air is for kids ..really that thing makes me go to toilet

Storyline is very predictable and not deep so your brain will relax watching this.",vuc2010,7/7/13,2013

464,8,Casey's Movie Mania: FAST & FURIOUS 6 (2013),"While it doesn't quite reaches the dizzying height of FAST FIVE in term of action sequences, FAST & FURIOUS 6 is surprisingly more fun and more entertaining than the previous five movies have come before.Just how far one can go with a franchise like THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS that originally centered on illegal street racing? In 2011, director Justin Lin and screenwriter Chris Morgan are smart enough to revitalize the series in FAST FIVE by tweaking the formula with a heist-movie undertone. Now, in this sixth installment, Lin and his company has upped their ante by turning FAST & FURIOUS 6 into a MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE-like international intrigue filled with vehicular mayhem. It's hugely ridiculous, alright but FAST & FURIOUS 6 has no doubt exceeded my expectation for being the best movie in the series I've ever seen so far.Chris Morgan's script has considerably improved this time around. All the returning cast shows more colors and winning chemistry and the jokes are funnier (especially involving Tyrese Gibson and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges). While Justin Lin can't really matches the height of FAST FIVE's action scenes, they still delivers nonetheless with each set-pieces are outrageously silly but hugely entertaining than the last.Better or improved as it may be, there are still rough patches within Chris Morgan's sometimes long-winded script -- particularly involving the convoluted revelation of Letty's back-from-the-death scenario. At times, Justin Lin tends to get overwhelmed with his hyper-kinetic direction. Some of the action scenes -- particularly hand-to-hand combat -- are mostly shot in rapid zooms and tight angles. Even the first two chase sequences during the night are sometimes hard to decipher what is really happening.Despite some of its flaws, FAST & FURIOUS 6 remains a solid action-movie blockbuster that both fans and action fans will find this a true crowd-pleaser. Likewise, don't leave the cinema yet once the credits roll. There is a mid-credit teaser that ties back the event of 2006's THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT and a revelation of a certain iconic actor who will be appeared in next July's FAST & FURIOUS 7 (which will be directed by SAW helmer James Wan).",caseymoviemania,5/24/13,2013
465,9,Even better than Fast 5! Didn't think that was possible!,"Between exiting the cinema after watching the enthralling fifth entry of this fender-bending franchise and entering to watch the latest installment, most viewers would have asked an important question: has the series reached its zenith? Suffice to say, the answer to any such query is a resounding no!Fast & Furious 6, unabashedly and unreservedly, is the best iteration of the series yet. Like its predecessor, the film follows soon after events that took place in Rio de Janeiro. The crew is all displaced in non- extradition safe havens. However, after hunting the team for the length of Fast Five, DSS Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) enlists their help. The crew must apprehend a skilled group of mercenaries, led by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), in exchange for full pardons. Undertaking the mission would also allow Dom the chance to reunite with Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who has resurfaced and is now aiding and abetting Shaw.Helming his fourth consecutive entry of the series, director Justin Lin has gone from strength to strength. Lin has ameliorated as an orchestrator with the progression of each film since he joined the venture with Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. Fast 6 is grander in both scope and scale compared to its precursor. Simply put, Lin has crafted a machine running at optimal efficiency.Moreover, Lin has at his disposal an impressive ensemble, each given their moment to shine. Vin Diesel portrays Dom with ease, while Tyrese Gibson, who plays Roman Pearce, is also prominent, providing a welcome comedic element to proceedings. The banter and camaraderie shared by the characters in general is evident throughout. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, now a bona fide action star, impresses yet again with his charismatic screen presence. While Fast 6 is essentially another testosterone fueled caper, the females are also part of the action, whether it includes a physical confrontation or getting behind the wheel.Furthermore, Lin employs creativity and variety in a number of breathtaking action sequences. The flamboyant exhibition of mayhem includes vehicles such as cars, tanks and even an aircraft. The hexad episode in the series also contains exquisite cinematography. Similar to his fascination with the landscape of Rio in part five, Lin captures the vibrancy of London. The movie also benefits from a cohesive screenplay, enabling Lin to delve straight into the action, since establishing characters in unwarranted. In addition, the editing of the film is also top notch.Last but not least, Fast 6 also ties up loose ends in the franchise, such as a significant link with the anachronistic Tokyo Drift, which may have been perceived as a spin off until now. The significance of family is an underlying theme throughout the film and Lin manages to create an emotional bond with the characters as well. Fast Five may have raised the bar, setting high expectations for the future of the franchise, but Fast & Furious 6 is able to exceed those expectations emphatically. The aforementioned cast and crew ensure there are no signs of franchise fatigue. While sequels predominantly experience a decline in quality, Fast 6 proves to be an exception, perhaps similar to the Harry Potter series in its progression. All in all, Fast & Furious 6 proves that the series is operating at full throttle in the fast lane, with plenty of gas still left in the tank.",mynameisibrahim,6/29/13,2013
467,5,Seems like the director took his hands off the wheel...,"It seems that nowadays directors are trying to out-do each other with the most number of unbelievable action scenes and unnecessary plot-twists. It's like the 80s all over again. Fast and Furious is transitioning into Die Hard.

The good part is that it was enjoyable, with a lot of good comedy. The rest though, left something to be desired. Reviewers Carl-Walster and Justin Curtis do a great job of pointing out everything that's wrong with the movie. Apart from what they've said already, why would a supposedly calculating criminal mastermind like Shaw suddenly go on a murderous rampage crushing innocent people on a highway?

Somewhere late into the movie they had decided that they needed another plot-twist, and turned Gina Carano's character, who was a good cop throughout the whole movie, into a dirty cop at the last minute.

While this movie packs excitement and is still a fun night out, it's a disappointment for F&F fans. All in all I wish Rob Cohen would come back to this franchise and take it back to the roots.

Looking forward to the sequel with Jason Statham. But that's from a horror movie director, so I'm not having high expectations.",dinuks,6/10/13,2013
470,8,Still going strong,"The movie is silly! The action is ridiculous! But you'll either love it or hate it. And if by now you're not sure which side you're on ... It's especially funny for me, because I'm not even into cars! But the movie and the characters we learned to love (yes even Paul Walkers ex-cop turned many other things) are there. And judging by the general vote here on IMDb, this might easily be one of the highest rated sequels and surely the highest rated entry number 6! There are a few things that even the fun part of the movie can't disguise. One of them being the relationship between Diesels character and the woman he's with. It's too convenient, not that anyone would start asking about things like that. There is also a love scene in the trailer of the movie that did not make it into the final theatrical version of the movie. It seemed too sexy anyways for a PG-13 movie.There is also a time-line thing that you have to be aware of. It's a bit complicated I guess, so while you don't have to have watched the other movies, some of them will make more sense (I think), after watching this. Especially the last one Michelle Rodriguez did (not Fast 5!). Although don't try to understand what happened there and how it's possible or anyone would think that ... well again, try not to over-think it! It's supposed to be fun! As are the action scenes! Realistic? Hell no!",kosmasp,8/29/13,2013
471,4,Fans of the series will like this. I found it too ridiculous to get into. The chases were so unbelievable it was almost laughable.,"""You wanna catch wolves, you need wolves."" After their heist made the gang all rich they have all settled in nicely to normal life but not in the US. When Hobbs (Johnson) needs a way to catch a criminal mastermind there is only one call he makes. Dom (Diesel) and Brian (Walker) get the crew together again but this time they are working with the law. This is a movie that doesn't really need much said about it to convince you to watch or not watch. Since it is the 6th in the series you have either kept up or not. That said...I have seen all of them and only really liked the 5th one because it was more of a heist movie then ""I have car, I go fast."" I know what your thinking...if you don't like it don't watch, on the other hand I can't really talk about it if I don't watch them. This one was, how do I put this...not good. The plot seemed OK, help catch the bad guy and you can go home. The problem is that this seemed to be that last thing on the movies mind. Five minutes after they agree to catch him they find him, and let him go. Then Dom and Hobbs meet him face to face, and let him go. The only way to catch this guy is only during long car chase after long car chase. The stunts and chases got more and more absurd to the point of being laughable. ***SPOILER*** Taking down a TANK with a smashed up Mustang to taking down a PLANE with a car that looked like a GEO Tracker on a runway that must have been 60 miles long. I mean seriously! ***SPOILER OVER*** There are also so many people jumping onto moving cars I lost count. I will again say I am not a fan of this series...and this movie is an example of why. Overall, fans of the series will like it, I struggle to find anything good to say...even the dialog is bad. I give it a C.",cosmo_tiger,12/9/13,2013
472,8,"""Slow & Laborious""","Expectations were high after the inexplicably positive reaction to Fast Five. That film, was completely over the top and thoroughly cool. It seemed as though the Fast franchise was on the precipice of becoming the perfect example of straight-up popcorn cinema; unabashed, silly, and awesome. The ads for Furious 6 gave the impression we were gonna be taken to yet another level this time, (did they frickin' crash a plane with a harpoon!!?) Things were about to get even more insaner-er, i mean we talking' VE-hicular warfare. What's left to say?Unfortunately, Fast 6 is not even awesome for what it is. Yes we get a couple pretty sweet moments here and again; the highway-tank battle being the prime example. But who would've thought the sludge weighing a movie like this down would be too...much....talking. I'm serious, there's about 35 minutes of setup which covers precisely the same material the trailer compressed into about 25 seconds. This is not good for a movie like this. But this wouldn't even be much of a problem if all those interaction/""character development"" scenes were remotely interesting...or good. They are not. The first half is snore inducing, and the characters are not only unlikable, but shallow...no, I mean like even for this kind of film. A good example of this is the movie introduces another hotshot, car-driving crew, and one of the characters has to outright spell out how they are the evil dopplegangers of our favorite nice, team of criminals. The other crew of characters, even for the one-dimensional stereotypes they are, are somehow flat. There's literally not one memorable thing about any one of them.Another issue the movie struggles with is focus. We've got Toretto with his whole ""get Letty back"" plot line, we've got the Rock doing his thing, and then there's this whole subplot with Paul Walker's cop past coming back for him in prison as he's ambushed by some dudes he put away, all of which could've been an entirely separate movie. The film jumps and cuts back and forth between so many different ideas, it loses all sense of direction. And the one- liners...OMG! Suffice to say, the one-liners on the trailer are the absolute best the film has. As I said, there's a couple amusing set-piece moments, but hardly enough to offset the dullness and trudgy pace.Undemanding viewers may derive some pleasure out of Fast and Furious 6 on a completely brainless, intentionally dumb and juvenile level. But Fast Five showed us we can do better.6.0/10",danamadeus,7/4/13,2013

Was disappointed that they let Gisele die because I was hoping that they would somehow remake that scene from Tokyo Drift where Han dies and show some miraculous escape. O well.

475,3,It is a action movie with little logic,"It was good at times but most of the time had me thinking someone didn't think this trough. First off some of the vehicles should have easily driven faster than the ones chasing them. Then there was a convoy scene were one of the most dangerous threats to man kind is a computer chip that was only guarded by two vehicles that had little to no armor and no major weapons. Then after the take out a tank Letty almost falls to her death until Dom rams his car into the bride wall and somehow catapults himself out of the car and caches her smashing the windshield of a car on the other side. First off when a car hit the wall earlier it went through the wall falling to its doom and now it can withstand impact. Then Dom somehow doesn't get hurt from crashing into the wall or landing straight on his back at full force.

The last part of the movie is just as bad because they are trying to stop a plane on a never ending runway. All they had to do was destroy the engines with the cable guns and the plane couldn't take off. There were more problems with the logic of this movie, but I'm done thinking about it.

477,9,In Response to carl-walster's Review,"I composed this originally in response to carl-walster's review of the movie. But I figured, since I've written much, I might as well post it for others to read.I'd like to comment on your review of the movie Furious 6. I really enjoyed the film so I would to give you reasons for your ""whys"".Riley fought Letty even if nobody else was looking so that if ever she successfully captured the latter, Hobbs would trust her more (remember that Hobbs and Riley just met at the start of the movie). Besides, Letty couldn't have known that Riley was working for Shaw. And about Shaw sending Riley ""to her death"", he didn't specifically send her to chase after Letty. It just happened that Riley went after Letty. Besides, Shaw was portrayed as someone who didn't care about his team personally.About your doubt about Dom's car going at high speed then drove into the plane without shooting forward, the TV series Mythbusters had proved that the physics of that scene was accurate. If you think about it, the plane was also moving so the momentum of the car (a term you mentioned in your review) did not actually diminish in an instant; it was still moving when in got to the plane (from the perspective of someone outside the plane).Then about the part where people were crushed by the tank and no one seemed fazed by it, it was not shown in the film (for obvious reasons) but surely ambulances came afterwards.I do agree though that the Military should have involved themselves in some of the situations but still there are lots of reasons I can make up why they were not there.Notwithstanding my disagreement with you, I also don't understand why Hobbs let Shaw get away when they have him to trade for Mia. He did not know she was going to be in the getaway plane. There would be no point in chasing Shaw again and capturing him if Mia was not there.However, movies should be rated, first and foremost, on their entertainment value and not for the logic behind the scenes. And I was very much entertained by the movie. It did not deserve a 5/10 rating.",arsiniryan,5/26/13,2013

479,3,"Brainless action with colorful cars, tanks and planes...","I see lots of people here defending this ""masterpiece"" with the claim that action movie needs only great action. Plot, acting and everything else is just irrelevant. ""It's not a documentary."" I read in numerous reviews...To those people I can just say to be careful what they wish. And I wonder why they bother with movies? Why not just watch Wrestling, NASCAR and cartoons? Mix that, ad few explosions, and you have Furious 6...This is a B movie that won a Jackpot and spend it all on visual effects. And underneath the sparkles it is still B movie with B movie actors, B movie script and shiny, but completely unbelievable action.Acting is wooden and most actors deliver their lines like they don't believe whats coming out of their mouths. Script is full of plot holes, plain stupidity and attacks on logic. Action scenes are just plain old fist-fighting and marshal arts bore, or elaborate stunts involving various forms of vehicles at high speeds and no considerations for laws of physics at all...I believe it's possible to make action movies that are not insulting viewers intelligence. But if we keep paying for this crap and saying to producers that crap is what we want, then crap we will continue to get... Sad.",pijavica,7/20/13,2013
481,8,Anglo Precision or Latin Love for Family,"Well Toretto went for the right thing as far as I am concerned. Those black pants with the white design were worth the fight!! I couldn't help noticing all those Land Rovers travelling at break neck speeds. Way back when I purchased a surplus British Land Rover Series IIA. With Fairey Hubs/Overdrive the best you could ever do was about 50MPH. But I guess with a V8 engine you can really push it now. Despite all the pyrotechnics, I think the storyline was quite believable and the actors were well chosen. Michelle Rodriguez is striking not so much for the tough fight scenes but more so for a moral toughness. I bet she is like that in real life. The other characters were well played and fit their roles. Even though intellectually you know that the scenes can't possibly be real, your body believes it. The tank and huge aircraft scenes were scary beyond belief. I can't figure out what type of tank that was, sort of a cross between a Chieftain & AMX.",clarkj-565-161336,5/24/13,2013
484,8,Upgrades!!!,"Well today i watched Fast & Furious 6 and I'll give you a quick review about the movie. Been watching all fast n furious series, and these are my thoughts about their 6th movie:

1. The story? Kinda twisted and unpredictable. The plot seems a bit forced to fit the criteria of an action movie. But after all, it kept me on my seat. The idea to bring someone from the dead, is not really good, though. Some plot holes were found. 8.1/10.0

2. The character? I was hoping that there would be another character to join the team. For those of you who haven't watched the previous sequel, will find it a little hard to understand the characters in this one. Same old Dom, same old O'Connor and Mia, same old Tej and Romey Rome, and so on. But one thing that i find interesting from the characters is the existence of a new ""super""villain, Shaw. If you are a Fast n Furious series fan, you're going to like him. 7.5/10.0

3. The actors? hmm... not much of improvement here. But they were all good. 7.0/10.0

4. The action? More cars, more explosions, more actions than the previous movie. I found some glitches in the movie that i find a rather disturbing. Glitches here means the nonsense level of this movie is beyond average at some point. 9.0/10.0

Sum up: So where are the upgrades? Everywhere! This is definitely better than the previous movie. The car chase, the action, the nonsense, the shootings, the fighting, the story, the actors are all upgraded. If you are a hardcore action movie lover, then you're going to have a good time watching this movie. Maybe it's a little bit forced, maybe it's a little bit ridiculous in some part, but one thing you have to remember: This is an action movie, so f* that. That is the X Factor of an action movie. All in all, Fast & Furious 6, is definitely entertaining. Final score: 8.4/10.0

P.S. : Don't leave the theater too soon. They gave me a surprise after the credit!",indra_pertamax,5/24/13,2013
486,9,Fantastic,"This was one of the most action-packed movies I've ever seen. And no, I'm not an adolescent.Those reviewers who complained about the contrivances or plot-holes, apparently didn't get the point. In this kind of sub-genre, you have to be willing to sit back with your popcorn and allow some inconsistencies or fallacies. The action makes up for it more than enough. The acting was decent; and aside from the moderate cheesiness, which was actually less than in certain James Bond flicks, I couldn't see anything to complain about. In my opinion this film deserves its high rating and is worthy of a second watch. It's one of the very few movies which I've ever rated 9/10. To say it once more: the action was fantastic, breathtaking, exhilarating and really fun!",joseph45-732-714081,7/8/13,2013
488,8,"As ""Fast and Furious"" As Ever!!!","The latest installment in the ""Fast and the Furious"" franchise ""Fast and Furious 6"" (*** OUT OF ***) resembles a James Bond extravaganza more than a urban epic about illegal street racing. Some cinematic franchises live and some die, and I'm still surprised that this one didn't collapse when Vin Diesel refused to star in John Singleton's ""2 Fast 2 Furious."" Afterward, the second sequel ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" (2006) looked like a surefire blow-out. Channing Tatum slipped behind the wheel for Asian antics, but Vin Diesel graced the end credits scene, imparting his official blessing. Diesel reprised his role as streetwise Dominic Toretto in ""Fast and Furious"" (2009) and teamed up again with FBI Agent Bryan O'Connor (Paul Walker). You can always tell a franchise by the number of characters that each entry cuts loose, and the ""Fast and the Furious"" has been conservative. Dom's girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) died in this outing, and our heroes exacted maximum vengeance on the villain. ""Fast Five"" (2011) reunited Dom and Bryan along with everybody else. Our heroes went to Rio de Janeiro and stole a bank vault with enough loot in it to relax. In a tacked on, end credits scene, the filmmakers revealed that Letty hadn't died! The franchise sacrificed one obnoxious character, Vince (Matt Schulze), who radiated all the charisma of a zombie. ""Five Fast"" introduced U.S. Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), and provided our heroes somebody to elude. Hobbs returns for the sixth ""Fast and Furious"" opus, and Letty reappears. The revelation that Letty suffered from a bout of amnesia after a near-death experience sounds like something from the Universal Pictures' franchise ""Bourne Identity."" Incidentally, Universal also produces ""The Fast and the Furious"" franchise. Until ""Fast 5,"" the ""Fast and the Furious"" movies didn't knock off any of their own like the ""Rocky"" movies. ""Fast and Furious 6,"" however, doubles the toll, shuffling off two additions going as far back as ""Tokyo Drift."" Of course, we won't know for sure if they're kaput until ""Fast and Furious 7"" comes out.

When ""Fast and Furious 6"" opens, Dom (Vin Diesel of ""Riddick"") and Elena (Elsa Pataky) are living in the Canary Islands with Brian (Paul Walker of ""Pleasantville"") and his new wife, Domini's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster of ""D.E.B.S.""), who has just had a baby boy. Nobody can extradite them. Eventually, Hobbs shows up and hands Dom an envelope with surveillance photos of Letty. Initially, Dom wants to make it a one-man mission to rescue Letty alone, but Hobbs halts him in his tracks. Not only does Hobbs need Dom, but he also needs Dom's team. Mia insists Brian accompany her big brother while Dom's new girlfriend Elena urges him to find out if Letty is really alive. Meantime, word reaches Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson of ""Baby Boy""), who skipped both ""Tokyo Drift"" and ""Fast and Furious."" Gibson served as the comic relief in the last two, and he conjures up laughs galore in ""Fast and Furious 6."" Computer whiz kid Tej Parker (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges of ""Four Brothers') fields the same phone call that Roman received and that Han Lue (Sung Kang of ""Better Luck Tomorrow"") and his girlfriend forever Gisele Harabo (Gal Gadot of ""Fast and Furious"") are handed when the Tokyo Police surround them. Before you can say no way, they are back together, and Hobbs explains that Letty is part of a high tech gang of criminals headed up by a notorious former British S.A.S. Officer, Major Owen Shaw (Luke Evans of ""Immortals"") who behaves like an adversary from a 007 adventure. Happily, ""Cellular"" scenarist Chris Morgan is back for his fourth ""Fast and Furious"" along with helmer Justin Lin. These two have turned the franchise around and taken it beyond what anybody could have imagined after ""2 Fast 2 Furious."" Shaw is no slouch as villains go, and he keeps Hobbs and our heroes hopping through hoops. Interestingly, when our heroes fall back on surveillance cameras to track Shaw through London, they complain about how you cannot spit in London without a camera catching you in the act. Shaw is the kind of villain who maintains complete control and rarely makes a mistake. Clearly, he isn't prepared when Letty spots Dom and wounds him with a bullet in the shoulder. Our heroine cannot remember Dom because she woke up with no memory in a hospital after her accident in ""Fast and Furious."" This is when Shaw added her to his crew. Shaw lives by a code that he calls 'precision,' and he boots those off his crew when they don't measure up to his high standards. Cyber-terrorist that he is, Shaw is searching for a microchip which will enable him shut down make all U.S. military computers for 24 hours. Naturally, Dom and company demand nothing less than full pardons to help out Hobbs.

Nothing about this franchise is remotely realistic, and director Justin Lin embraces ""the ridiculousness"" to forge greater suspense and tension. As Dom tells Letty at one point when he saves her life during an incredible stunt, you have to take everything on faith. As it turns out, not only do the filmmakers take everything on faith, but the audiences also seem to be doing the same. In the last ""Fast and Furious"" thriller, our heroes dragged a safe through exotic downtown Rio. Just about everything that unfolds in this outrageously entertaining but hopelessly predictable nail-biter is larger-than-life. A duel with a modern army tank on a high-rise bridge jammed with civilian traffic and a spectacular nighttime encounter between our tenacious heroes and a gigantic cargo jet that is reminiscent of the flaming demise of the Hindenburg airship make this movie worth the price of admission. Anybody who wants to take a break from reality will enjoy this fast-paced melodrama with one or two surprises.",zardoz-13,6/2/13,2013
490,2,So stupid movie,"I really liked the previous Fast and Furious, Fast 5. Some of the previous ones weren't that good but because the last one was so good I really had high hopes. And oh boy was I disappointed. Action was stupid and boring. Plot was even for an action movie stupid and mindless.The ending was just so stupid and I think every person with a brain was already thinking that how long can it be. Action can be unrealistic but if its also boring then you are doing something horrible wrong. I am glad that Justin Lin doesn't direct these anymore, he has lost it.Anyway it was a real shame that this was the last Fast and Furious where Paul Walker was with. Fast 5 was great. This is horrible.",antti-eskelinen-329-929792,12/9/13,2013
494,5,The Franchise Has Taken A Wrong Turn & Crossed Limits,"i just saw this film few minutes ago & i just came to do a review.i have done so many reviews i am not a critic if i was one then things would be different as i would have giving full points without a reason thats just what critic's are do they are a decease .

now fast a furious is a big franchise unfortunately since previous few installments its gone out of line & has taken a wrong turn it is trying to be something its not.these films were about heists if you remember the first film but it was inside USA they didn't go international till Tokyo drift thats where i think it went bad after that i am saying Tokyo drift was the last best film in the series.here is why for me.

the plot of fast 6 continues from fast 5 it starts as Hobbs(the rock) goes to Dom Toretto(Vin diesel) & asks him to help him in capturing criminal shaw(Luke Evans) & also gives info about one of their members Letty(Michelle Rodriguez)who was once lover of Dom & believed to be dead.

now if you have seen fast & furious 2009 you will remember what happened to Letty .now in this film Letty don't remembers anything & when the race scene comes between Letty & Dom i was like oh yes the movie went back to original cars & racing stuff.but they have gone too far this time its like oceans trilogy & other heist films.the action was so hilarious here specially when Vin diesel jumped to catch Letty of the tank & landed one the car safely i mean is this spider-man i am seeing

the cast failed to impress as again except rock he shows his usual wrestling moves,the dialog's & comedy involved here with some nice stunts will bring cash to this film,.cant blame the director or any other here the reason is that movies now have become a money making business they don't care about the story anymore & because of this the true fans of any franchise gets disappointed.

over all fast & furious 6 is a one time watch but only if you seen all five films before that.if you don't then its not for you.

my rating is 5/10.fast 6 is a solid example of why most people prefer classic films & will watch them any time",FilmMan47,5/30/13,2013
495,8,Exciting movie with a long runway,"I really liked this latest Fast & Furious(6), I think it was the best one yet! The story-line was good, written very well, acting was superb (as always), and the action almost made me pee in my pants. It's worth seeing again and then buying the DVD for your own personal movie library when it comes out for purchase. Even with the enormously long unending runway which, for me, slightly diminished the realism of the story, I still enjoyed the movie greatly. The stunts and photography was beyond excellent, and if you've never been much of a fan of Fast & Furious, this one will turn you into one! Lastly, I loved the ending... for a grown man, I almost cried. Oscars are in for the getting!!!!",dant51,6/10/13,2013
496,10,one word to this movie WOW,"The last one was good, because a lot of action at the rest of the plot, but this one connected all the lost cable that bring us the 3 movie (Tokyo drift). Is sad to see how they traded one for one, I mean the lost of the girl in the last part, but that was necessary, but the ending of this movie is going to make another epic fast and furious. I like how the director make this movie, a lot of action, a little of drama, a little of sad part, even race like the old times in the first movie. Something that i did not saw was Tego Calderon and Don Omar. But Vin Diesel told that in the next movie will be in Puerto Rico( or almost some part of it) so the next one will be a revenge, plus a add to the family of toreto, the protagonist of the Tokyo drift. Is logical he is going to revenge his friend Hank. So if you are reading this go see the movie, and prepare to be 2 hours of action and in the last minute of the movie don't go , sit and watch the last part.",hatachiclaud,5/23/13,2013
499,8,Fast moving and better team players,"A perfect team movie ,where every character has enough time to show its talent.This movie was not all about action,there was enough humour in it.I liked the concept of team wise fight and perfect candidates for each guy including a white Hobbs (lol).I liked the fifth part also when they introduced Hobbs a tough cop which has entirely changed the concept of franchisee.Now they are not just racing cars they have turned to mercenaries like things. The action sequence were nicely executed and offered a quality experience for its viewers.I am eager to see next part of this franchise where the team has to face Jason Stathom.",arun-yadav92,7/8/13,2013
501,9,Furious Frenzy,"My mind almost exploded many times throughout this movie. Myself as well as most of the folks at Universal I'm sure are surprised this franchise has made it to the sixth installment. There is now a huge ensemble of characters from various films to keep track of as well as new ones being introduced, so it comes as a huge compliment to say I was never confused throughout 'Furious 6' (the opening title). I have not been this giddy while watching a movie in theatres since 'Transformers'. It's probably Tyrese.Granted, these are two franchises who have hardly ever tried to court realism. This movie is so Ludicrous that the audience I was with was laughing at what was being portrayed on screen. 'To think this series used to centre around street racing', I thought as a cargo plane is coming down on a military base rife with explosions.This move is accomplished several times throughout the movie. It is no less thrilling the fourth time.Vin Diesel is passable, Paul Walker is the same as usual (kinda boring). The screen time is well divided among the entire cast with everyone getting their own moments. Tyrese has become the series comic relief which I don't mind. The fights, chases and races are superbly choreographed, top notch and the best part is the movie seems pretty self-aware. It irks me to find out that the next installment will be without its main director (Justin Lin, on board since the third).There are a few faults with the movie of course as no movie is without them. The decisions made by some of the characters make almost no sense. The plausibility angle is stretched beyond breaking point, even for the series. It wasn't revealed what the McGuffin that was driving the plot was until the last 30 minutes. I imagine the writers getting so far ahead of themselves that they resorted to one upmanship handing over the script of the last scene trying to screw each other over.This is just me nitpicking though, because in a way I found it all just so confounding what was happening on screen that I couldn't help but be engaged. A series that is able to get this far while standing on its shaky and genre shifting pillars deserves to be commended. See it in theatres!Rating: +3-3 -2 -1 0 +1 +2 +3",FilmGamer,6/21/13,2013
502,4,Not a good story and neither it has satisfying action,"I expected too much of it and that might be my fault, but i am more than sure that the movie has not done enough justice with all the fans out there. The previous parts were all great but this sixth sequel has sunk the bar too low and with all the cheap and cliché-contained tricks, applied to make this movie do something, has failed badly.The only good parts are the hand-combat scenes and a little bit of humor, while the rest of this crappy movie can't be bought by the intelligent viewers.I did not wanted to write this review but i think it will save your precious time if you just watch those scenes.",dhoommachale008008,7/18/13,2013
505,9,There is room for Justin Lin and the crew to blow our minds once again when they reunite for FAST 7!,"Brothers (In Laws) race down the scenic road of Canary Islands in Spain as Mia gives birth to her baby boy. Brian a father now and Dom and the rest of the wanted crew have retired since their near unbelievable heist in Rio. Settled into a good life they all have left their pasts behind them whilst still holding onto the passion of pushing the pedal to the metal. The Samoan Thor; Hobbs turns up at Doms front door seeking help to bring to justice a gang of criminals headed by a ruthless ex-mercenary by the name of Shaw. Hobbs' main vantage was a photo inside the brown case envelope that he hands to Dom which has a photo of his old flame Letty who was presumed dead in FAST & FURIOUS (The 4th Movie). If it matters to Dom it matters to his entire crew. All hands once again on deck for an even more faster and an even more furious-er FAST & FURIOUS 6. This is round 4 for Justin Lin with this franchise which is over 12 years old. For 6 years he has pushed the limits further and further toy-ing the thin boundaries of reality and fantasy. The first scene from FAST 5 and every scene from F&F 6 make me wonder if his nitrous powered franchise would burn out. Just as one may look at a Nissan GTR fly by and say ""that's unbelievable"" , the audience will not stop thinking the same but then caught up in the brilliance of the moments simply believe. How Lin and the cast does this only they can explain. I just sat their mesmerized, entertained and at the edge of my seat the whole way. The franchise has never been about a genius plot. It's always been about the grease, nuts and powerful engines roaring under the hoods. The franchise breathed new life in American Muscle Cars worldwide bringing up trends and lifestyles of street racing. F&F 6 mixes the old and the new all up once again and revisits the beginning from 12 years ago, racing for pink slips, hot pursuits and reinventing cars. Computer Generated Imagery plays a pivotal role as most of the stunts require serious if not complete CGI assistance. The distance reached out by the stunt team is massive and every minute of their effort will be worth it when you see the Dodge and the Skylines take to the streets. There is only so much I can discuss without spoiling this for you. So if you have not watched the movie as yet get to it right now. A final comparison needs to be done since FAST 5 is my all time favorite so far. Let me wrap up by saying the heist in Rio has not been outdone as yet. There is room for Justin Lin and the crew to blow our minds once again when they reunite for FAST 7!

507,4,"great action for car lovers, weak story for movie lovers","I didn't expect much better to be honest. This is the sixth 'Fast & Furious', I mean how much more can be said about a gang a villains who run around in fast cars? I enjoyed some of the visual and action, especially around central London but as far as the story and acting goes I feel it was rather weak. It's a story which has been told over and over again, the ex-villain (played by Vin Diesel) who corroborates with the police (played by Dwayne Johnson). There's nothing wrong with the plot itself, but when a movie is over two hours long you need to find a way of keeping it interesting.If you're a fan of this series then of course you should watch it, otherwise I would say don't bother.",shaunboyle1967,11/26/13,2013
509,4,The last 40 minutes was ridiculous.,"First of all, I'm gonna say I'm not that huge of a F&F fan, and I'm not sure how true fans feel about this, I'm just reviewing from a logical point of view.

The film starts nicely, the whole crew is relaxing with all the fortune acquired from the previous film, and things are going smooth. Then you see Hobbs, investigating an attack on a military convoy in Russia, and he knows who has done it, and with Letty alive, he knows where to look for help. He gets Dom and his crew's help and with some intelligence Hobbs has acquired, they track Shaw in London. They have trouble capturing Shaw as you would imagine, and after a race between Letty and Dom where he threatens Dom's family afterward, the ridiculousness starts. Shaw wants some computer chip that is apparently inside a tank, but you'll find that out later. This chip is in a NATO military base in Spain. Somebody working for Shaw infiltrates the base, he is captured, so Hobbs and the commander of the base decide to follow protocol and move the component, with a ridiculously under-powered convoy. Just two jeeps and a truck, that are so incompetent they can defend themselves from 4 guys attacking them with another jeep. Anyway, Shaw, Letty and one of his men, that apparently has learned how to operate a tank somewhere, literally drive out of the truck carrying the tank and start rolling over and shooting up innocent people, when Letty protests their acts. The tanks chews up cars and move true the highway, the crew are deciding what to do, until Roman drive to the front of the tank and has to hit the brakes because of an oncoming car, yet for some reason, his 1970s Mustang is not instantly crushed under the tank, but it can be explained because the car was moving fast and it didn't hit the tank's tracks, so it's not that off. Roman hooks the car to the tanks with a cable and jumps in Brian's car, and they decide to use the tank as an anchor to stop the tank. Through effort, the throw the remains of the Mustang down a bridge and as they thought, the car acts as an anchor and tanks is overturned, not like it is 80 tons or anything. So they capture Shaw. And now it gets even more ridiculous. As one would expect, Shaw has a backup plan. He has taken Mia hostage. The commander of the base says, naturally, it changes nothing. Then, suddenly, Hobbs pulls out his revolver and puts it to the commander's head and say ""It changes everything."", and they decide to let a world class criminal, capable of killing millions of people go, with the military chip that will make him capable of that. Yeah, right. NO ONE would risk millions of lives for somebody they don't even know! I wouldn't do it for the love of my life! But, then again, it's a movie, so these things are expected. Shaw starts fleeing, though he had warned them he would kill Mia if he sees them pursuing him, Tej jams the phones and they start to follow him. Then out of nowhere, conjures an Antonove An-124 that has been able to dodge all the defense systems and land in a freaking military base. Here's where the most ridiculous action scene in history of film making starts. The Runway appears to be 40 km long, while the longest runway in the world is 5.5 km and it's in China. Anyway, Dom manages to board the plane after Shaw, with Hobbs following him. And they start to fight, all of them. the rest of the crew is on the ground and tries to shoot the plane's flaps with harpoons they had acquired previously. Some manage to shoot the wings of the plane, and are unsuccessful. Then Brian and Mia getaway from the plane in a small Alpha Romeo, and with a harpoon that I don't know where they acquired from, manage to shoot the one of the flaps of that gigantic plane, while it's been trying to take off with its nose in the air for the last five minutes. The small Alpha Romeo manges to pull down the flaps, and plane starts going down, and breaks like it's made of freaking plastic. Oh and Gisele died in the middle of all this. The film ends with the whole 'family' having barbecue, and I believe they want to have a 7th movie. I hope that won't be as ridiculous.",miladed,9/9/13,2013
510,5,What happened ?,"Yes it's an action film...........so you don't expect a script worthy of Shakespeare.

But seriously, there's barely any character development in this film whatsoever - and the script is so basic it's totally unbelievable.

###########Spoilers ahead################# The franchise has never been known for realism - just think of the safe scene in number 5.

But it's generally always been an enjoyable ride - fun characters, great action and excellent car chases.

This film fell flat for me - the action scenes ironically overpowered the film, leaving what was left feeling empty.

Starts off well, but soon becomes just an expensive reel of stunt after stunt.

And the majority of the cast were barely used. Most of the script just involved The Rock, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker.

And a couple of the action sequences weren't even believable - you can suspend belief so far, but this was taking it to extremes.

Unfortunately those action sequences were the 'big' ones............the tank leaving a trail of destruction and the finale featuring the longest take off in history!!!! The tank being totalled after the car it was towing went over the bridge, and the finale with the aircraft chase going on forever.

I mean seriously - the plane touched down partway down the runway, didn't stop and carried on at near take off speed forever.

Visually impressive, but not at all realistic. And that was the problem with the scene, no sense of suspense or even attempted realism.

Then there were the character moments. Vin Diesel pulling a bullet out of himself with no hint of a whimper, and cars rolling all over the place - but no hint of even a graze or limp afterwards.

Worst part for me anyway though was the quick death of Han and Giseles relationship. May just be me, but their relationship seemed the most real - yet Gisele dies in the blink of an eye...........and no funeral, not even a look for the body in case she survived.

Then you've got Paul Walkers character infiltrating a prison, getting into solitary and then (seemingly) just walking out and flying back to London.

So gets a 5 from me. Looks like they've already got number 7 lined up from the ending, but it'll need a far better script to get me hooked.

Series should really have ended at number 5.",dinalt10,9/19/13,2013
512,4,Very disappointing,"I was so excited to watch this movie when it came out, I organised my friends for this movie myself and one of my friend's birthday was that day. I was expecting a quality movie, and it was until the end. They tried to make the effects very exciting and fascinating, but they forgot to make it realistic! Flying head-butts, smack-down moves while fighting, endless plane road (the plane was moving for at least 20 min)... The ending was so terrible that I almost went out of the cinema and skipped where Jason Statham came. The car effects were amazing, the story was good but they made it very unrealistic and it looked dumb for me at the end. Don't go to cinemas for this movie... not worth it",berketaseli,5/29/13,2013
517,4,Disappointing,"I get movies are about entertaining the audience, I do, but I also hope to be entertained with talented casts and a good plot. The movie had some great ideas, but jus failed at portraying any realism. Many times throughout the film, the scenes were loosely connected and highly unrealistic with the main characters performing death defying acts alike an xmen or avengers...not car tuners. After a few of those, the film lost my attention. I just kept muttering, 'of course'. Also, some car scenes were forced in mindlessly having very little to do with what was happening. The movie twists and curveballs could've been better if they didn't flat out lie to the viewers. At the end, after learning the truth, a lot of scenes didn't make sense...not even a little. Then, there's the ending. Um, yeah, that could happen. I still gave the movie a 4 for the action and muscle car sound clips. This franchise always does those things well:)",jcmbruce,5/25/13,2013
522,1,CGI...Meh.....story...Meh....Script....Meh Spoiler alert!,"This movie honestly made me furious!! Story- the story was awful! even though for a action movie like this, story is really secondary, but the problem is they came changing what has happened in the past just to create crappy twists. A Twist would only work if it surprises the audience but at the same time can be accepted as it make logical sense. However, all these stupid twists that made no sense and threw alway all the story viewers watched and believed in previous episodes without logical explanations is a real put off. For example we all expected and knew Letty was dead, and now they bring her back in with crappy explanation by the plot. And ever since 2006 when Tokyo drift came out, viewers believed Han was killed by that crazy jap guy, and now they are changing that too just to bring in Jason Statham?, I m sure there are many other ways to include him in the plot. There are many other stupid twists but I am sure viewers get my point.Action and stunts- For movies like this, the action and stunts can be as crazy and unrealistic as possible and no many people would complain, but the important thing is that it has to look REAL. Fast 6 used way too much CGIs and it looked awful. If we look back in to most of the previous episodes, none of them were short of crazy stunts but at least they look real such as Fast two when Paul walker drove the car into the boat, or fast 5 when Paul walker and Vin diesel drove the car off the cliff and landed into the sea, i am not sure if those stunts were really made but aleast they look as if they did and that is what satisfy me for movie likes this. CGI is fine for movies like avengers where the plot is based on a fantasy world, but i am sure for most people that follows the FnFurious serious, they watch it because they like action and cars and wanted to see crazy Stuff they don't see in real life, but to see how the movie overly use CGIs makes me feel being cheated on and was a big disappointment to me.Script- Horrible, but not as bad as the two points discussed above so not going to get into it.Lastly, was anyone put off by the overly exposed product placement of Corona beer?",wj826117,6/5/13,2013
533,1,"There will be a few spoilers, so heads up if you haven't seen it.","This movie was painstakingly average. It seems to be intended for people who do not notice or don't mind how inconsistent and cheesy it can be at times. A good action show tries to portray fictional realism in an attempt to evoke a certain reaction from the audience--the feeling of ""If this situation were actually happening in real life, I feel like this is just how it would play out"". The scenes that specifically bothered me were: the scene with the tank on the highway; am I really supposed to believe that people are so incapable as to not be able to avoid an army tank that only took up a third of the road, when they were in much smaller and faster vehicles? Most of them just B-lined it right into the centre of the tank and to their deaths. That's just ridiculous, man. Also, the scene on the military runway with the airplane;the woman who died-the Asian guy's woman-didn't need two hands to shoot that tiny gun she had, so I was just like ""Yeah, OK"". The other thing is that the scene was around half an hour long, all the while they were speeding along at somewhere between 200-300 miles per hour. I'm sure the runway was 100-150 miles long. Something so blatantly improbable would have bothered me in elementary school. Also, when the antagonist said if I see you guys behind me I'll call them and have them kill your wife and daughter, so let me go and my team. Then as soon as they leave they jam the signals so he can't call and they start the chase. How about just jamming the signals and NOT letting them leave. They just made a pathetic excuse to slip in another chase. ~Forest Gump Voice~ And that's all I have to say about that.",steve_n_11,6/5/13,2013
534,5,I Couldn't Park Realism for Fantasy...Sorry.,"Dispense With Credible Story, Quality Acting�Add More Cow Bell (i.e. cars in this case)� Heck yeah, this is F&F6 and we don't need no stinkin' realism to muck-up the fine action. Do we? Apparently not as Vin Diesel and Paul Walker trade leads In a most curvaceous alpine-ish mountain road which is, perhaps, somewhere in Italy near the Alps in order to claim first at the cloistered whatever (a monastery?) where Paul's other half is giving birth to his son. Wow, mindless racing where any minute you could be killed if you went over a curve? But hell yes its worth it if GT-R was ahead of the Detroit combobulation called a Challenger. Definitely worth the risk your infant child will become fatherless, no doubt! I'm rambling, but this movie starts out absolutely inane in every way.

I love to be entertained with smart action such as fantastic car chases, but I abhor movie scripts that are so ""dumbed-down"" as to make such demands, uh, like erasing a lifetime of education in order to ""buy-in"" to all the BS. I also love comic-strip characters done right movie-wise, but supposedly (yeah, lol!) real-life ex-cons co-opted for an elite squad of a Seal Team 6 vehicular assault ""black-ops"" team�Well, you need some damn fine writing to pull this off. Sorry, but this is a real mess. The dialog seems as if a fifth-grader wrote , edited, and gave it the ""hell yeah"" I like it ""thumbs-up"". It is so poor as to be laughable. I didn't skip the premise, but actually waited until now to say it is among the most inane senseless movie concepts I've ever seen brought to screen with what appears to be a huge budget. P.T. Barnum's axiom of suckers must be like Moore's Law�it just goes on and on.

It's not something to be particularly proud of, but the actors/actresses approach this stuff like it has merit. I'll give them some credit for that. With the infantile silly crap they've been given to work with they give it 110%. It can't save this morass of embarrassments�except for the over-the �top car chases. That is the raisin De ete for this whole thing and they've really tried to meld reality with digital ""we'll do anything we damn well please"" craftsmanship. This is where the franchise clearly goes from trying to have a foot in reality and stepping deeply into this is a comic-strip come to life movie which gives us total creative control. So, if you can last long enough through the interspersed crap of this mess and get to the several car chases sandwiched inside�Plus, get into your no need for reality ""I'm watching an excellent comic-strip brought to life"" mode, then you can actually see some art and some value in FF6.

What I've asked of you is pretty big bill of goods. Your time is probably much more valuable and why should anyone ask you to dumb yourself down�Right? Well, surprisingly I'm going to tell you for the car chase scenes you just might want to try�Otherwise, skip this dreck. I fear for several of these actors/actresses futures�I hope they got a slice of the pie cause we all know there's a huge number of folks who love this fifth-grader with unlimited wallet stuff out there. It'll be a big opening a big following 3 or 4 weeks, a big pay-per-view, and another life on DVD/Blu-Ray. It's still crap though.",AudioFileZ,6/20/13,2013
536,5,Like Watching Indian Action Movie,"I think this movie has met with its objective – a good popcorn movie. It was fun/ fast/ loud/and stylish. If you are looking for those things you will love this movie. If you look for story then look elsewhere.This movie is no longer related much to cars and engines like its predecessor but rather concentrated in action/ gun fight/ bombing. Through there are many cars chasing scenes it not really about the car anymore. (Don't they like assemble car anymore? all they do is went out to buy one) While the movie was really fun to watch many things that went on in here are just pure ridiculous that it turn to be so funny. It reminds me of watching Indian movie that no matter how beaten up or shot at - the guy is all he seem to get little bleeding at the side of his mouth. He is untouchable!!! And in the end anything will be alright. Even the dead are now undead (remind me the like of American soap opera like The Bold and the Beautiful)Another good thing about this movie is the set, it is freakishly huge!!! Involve the use of tank/plane/bike and so on. It is fun to watch that they don't seem to hold back the budget and bring about everything that they wish to get. Anyway while they did managed to make a really fun movie to watch the story and how unrealistic everything is just pure ridiculous. I recommended if you want to watch a mindless fast pace action movie.Rating: 5 /10",Mr_Sensitive,6/9/13,2013
537,4,Lowest common denominator lucks out..,"Big, dumb, and sporadically fun.Fast and Furious 6 is an exploitation movie without the exploitation; the movie that puts the ridiculous into action; and the poor into acting. During the 13 hours this film went on for there are gyrating Londoners, a ludicrous story, explosions, a tank and er some cars though this is a fleeting diversion from the tedious plot, dreadful acting and banal direction.Who is this film for? Teenagers on a date who will be diverted from each other by the loud splashes of colour that assault you... sporadically.Highpoints: Luke Evans is clearly the highpoint. Though at times I expected him to say ""I would have gotten away with it to if it hadn't been for you pesky kids!"" Disappoints: Michelle Rodriguez, an actress with so much promise that seems to be deep-diving to the z-list.",stuart-573-245936,5/26/13,2013
539,5,"If nothing else, it's entertaining.","I'll be honest I had never previously seen a Fast and Furious film before - shameful I know. However, despite not knowing the characters etc. I personally thought that the film was awful in many ways. the fakeness of it was unreal and having lived in London all my life its amazing to see scenes where there are no other vehicles around and so on. However, even allowing for the truly ridiculous events, I thoroughly enjoyed the film. There was never a dull moment and it was pretty unpredictable.Overall, although I thought that this was a pretty poor film I found it fairly entertaining and would recommend watching it and to be honest, even if you don't fancy it, just joking about the fake and stupid scenes and parts of the plot with my mates was enough for me to enjoy the film.",alexreyn22,9/9/13,2013
545,5,Average and nothing more,"So... I had high expectations about this movie, neither did I know what it was about neither did I know what it would be but I was sure about one thing. this going to be one of the best movies of 2013...

well after watching the movie for me it felt like .. yes, indeed it was not that bad but it was so linear and in one direction.. it was basically a long racing-shooting-running 2 hour episode.

OK.. the characters were okay, the Rock was the most understandable for me, at least he made sense but I did not understand what others talked about or did. The black guy was funny, the Chinese guy was funny.

basically this movie is about two teams trying to do race against each other and win money. And because the story was so retracted I still didn't really understand what I was watching all the time and Who was fighting who? in the end they fight on an jumbo cargo transport plane where it later crashes into the airfield runway and explodes, making Vin diesel jump out the plane in a car in the last second. this is somewhat unbelievable. also I'm sure I watched the first fast to furious way back , but never seen the rest of the series until this one.

one thing that I noticed is that in some scenes, especially fighting or action packed scenes - they were so fast that I couldn't even see what was going on - a turn off.

the cars in the movie looked good but maybe not cool enough..

I think this movie could be better if it was not so narrow to a straight line.

if you are a Fast and furious fan go and see it you may not get disappointed. if you never seen fast and furious this movie will only confuse you.",crackcocan,6/17/13,2013
546,4,Disappointing,"Overall its a disappointing movie in the franchise. The 6 movies have had a mixed bag, with tokyo drift being the best in my opinion. The cinematography and vibrant colours mixed with the culture has more to offer.But moving onto ""Fast & Furious 6"" There really is no acting in this movie. I wasn't expecting much from Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Vin Diesel, but expected more from Paul Walker (Brian). Also, some the scenes seem to be edited so much as to piece together scenes that don't mix well. On the other hand, most of the action scenes make you feel like you're chasing Shaw yourself which for me adds to the action impact. While the plot is very silly, it will get a few laughs out of you (yes it seems more of an action comedy). And the movie keeps you on the end of your seats. So if you're a fan of this franchise, or any action franchise, see it. If you're more into drama or comedy (although this movie has some of each), I suggest you see something else.",hamish-jon-mclean,5/29/13,2013
547,4,fast backward and furious reverse,"Hmmm....a couple of years have passed from Fast Five and it's natural to think about the sequel as a real success since let's admit it, first 5 in the series were not bad at all. But, always this BUT....sadly, the saga ends here concerning the quality bar. Our heroes are the same but what happened to real acting?too much fake acting guys...where is the nerve, where is the focus, where is the mean attitude? I guess when you are famous...you forget about many things...and loose your qualities that made you and put where you are now. Back to the movie...where are the good writers?What happened to the script?Boring and predictable story! Then again...what happened with the special effects?The bar is going down on the chart! I can go on like this all day! What happened with the picture?Yes, even filming is bad, the angles, the way you SEE the action, the Field of View is sometimes too low! The movie director is the same as Fast Five so where is the fault? I don't know what happened to Hollywood studios...everything is wrong! Wait, I know! Finnancial crisis happened and we see that in every movie coming out!",acocoasa78,7/5/13,2013
554,3,This series and I--we go way back. Sort of.,"This franchise has been providing big dumb entertainment for 12 years now. And I've been there nearly every step of the way. It all started summer of 2001, when the original came out. I was never one for a car chase or caper film, but something caught my eye about it from the trailer. So I bought my ticket. Sat there, thinking often man this is really dumb. But the action sequences (then directed by Rob Cohen) really gave it muscle. It had this infectious energy that I enjoyed. By the time the end scene (the train scene) came around, I was kind of hooked. I knew they'd make more of these. Unable to wait till the inevitable sequel came out, I ran out and saw 2Fast 2Furious.

Well no. No I didn't. It's the only one of these I haven't seen in fact.

Later they broke off with this sort of spin-off with ""Tokyo Drift"" stuck to the end. Good for it, thought I. Its theater run came and went, too, without me. This despite the fact that I saw nearly every movie that came out at that time. My time then was more...spacious back then than it is now. Later it would be shown on cable and I caught it then. The reappearance of Dom at the end intrigued me. I thought, you see what they did there? They tossed out some bait to see what they'd catch. And you know what? What they did there may have been the most important moment in the franchise's unlikely history. They enclosed the franchise back into its star. The animal was at that moment named. Now we have something..

When it came to Fast & Furious I actually rented the video as a new release. I was that eager to see it. I enjoyed it even though it was seen on my miserable 32"" non-HD television. I remember a fuel truck rolling over in the Dominican Republic and an epic car chase through a drug running tunnel on the US.-Mexico border. And Letty being a double agent in a drug cartel. I must have enjoyed it enough to go out and...ACTUALLY SEE FAST FIVE IN THE THEATER. For the first time since the first F&F film, I was sitting in a theater watching one! They won me back! (applause) It only took ten years but they did it.

While Fast Five's success paved the way for Furious 6 (and 7 and probably 8, 9...), Furious 6 is not the film that 5 is. What made Fast 5 so great was that it is a caper film. It also seemed to send the franchise in a slightly more serious direction by raising the stakes in the form of Hobbs (And what other franchise could ever see adding Dwayne Johnson as a path to seriousness?) But even though Fast Five marks the franchise's serious turn, it's also funny, which legitimized its utter ridiculousness.

Furious 6 really wants to be funny, too. It's kind of like Fast 5's wannabe jealous unfunny brother. Same writers, same director, most of the same cast. And somehow, very different films. It's as if the writers have become boxed in by their own formula. And the script has its issues, for instance:

Why does Riley, if she's actually with Shaw, chase after Letty in the notoriously brutal girl fight? Did they only decide during the later stages of writing that Riley was a mole and just didn't want to ditch the first Riley/Letty fight? It didn't make sense.

In the tank scene, on the Spanish highway, they kill the tank by attaching a cable to Roman's mangled car. But wouldn't the ultra-strong cable just rip through the car? Let alone turn the tank upside down?

Just how long are NATO runways? The climactic scene in the cargo plane must have been set on one that was 200 miles long.

I still like this franchise and will be interested to see more. Jason Statham should be able to infuse it yet again with new energy. They could even get rid of Hobbs (killed in a blaze of glory? Yeah that'd be a good story point). One spot on the crew vacated by Han and Gisele with Sean Boswell (which many of the F&F forums already seem to be discussing).",RolloTomasi,5/30/13,2013
559,5,Furious George and the Fast Cars,"A Superman II opening recap for the four people who had never seen any of the previous films, yet actually bought a ticket to a sixth installment of a series, only proves how incredibly silly these films are. And truth be told, I finally gave up ""critiquing"" the franchise and had fun with the nonsense known as Fast Five. I had fun, here as well.

Furious 6 � with all the name changes, I can't wait to see what they'll call part VII, is just as silly and over-the-top as the other entries, but at least they don't pretend to be anything but a big-budgeted Grindhouse movie. That trend began with #5 and that's probably why I enjoyed both of those and rank them the best of the series.

Really, the paper-thin plot is incidental to the number chase and fight scenes. But, just for fun, the faux pas Ocean's Eleven crew is reassembled in order to take down an even worse bad guy and in return, they get pardons in order to return home to the US.

Seriously, that's all you need to know about the script. And chances are, anyone who bought a ticket to this had no intention of finding any depth here. Just fast cars, beautiful women and muscular men doing macho things�you know, the norm. And you'll get all that in spades, even though it slows down for a tremendous amount of the film.

When the heat is on, it's great, no-brainer, entertainment, despite the incredibly ridiculous stunts at times (Vin Diesel's mid air rescue was about as real as Jason Statham's over-the-bay car bomb heroics in Transporter 2.) There were a lot of ""Wow. Really?"" moments I had, but more stuff I had fun watching, such as when they introduced some huge dude towards the end, I knew instantly he was going to be The Rock's match. When that came to pass, albeit a far-too-quick scene, it was enjoyable.

It's best just to sit back and enjoy. I mean, when I was a kid, the man in the rubber Godzilla suit looked just as realistic as these guys.",thesar-2,7/13/13,2013
561,2,The Laws of Physics Do Not Apply,"If you want mindless action, there are many better movies to watch. This movie is aimed at the youth market, primarily boys who play video games. The script is off-putting for several reasons: 1. the franchise has gone past the street racing story that made the first several installments fun to watch. The sixth film has become more James Bond than East L.A. The world must be saved from evil geniuses who will possess Doomsday military hardware unless Dom and his crew stop them. This premise takes the story away from California and off to Moscow, Macau, London, and Spain where the team works with a unit of the U.S. government. 2. The dialog is leaden. The main characters speak in philosophical nuggets. As one might expect from the spy genre, they did not scrimp on special effects, explosions or computer graphics. Because of the number of sequels, the dialog is filled with nostalgic references to the past. One should have seen the prior films in order to understand all the references. The sappy references to the past are overdone.

Dom's men live by a code - something about keeping the family together. The team is not only saving the world, they are saving Letty who is in the clutches of the evil geniuses who will destroy the world. Apparently, she didn't die in a prior sequel, but she does suffer from amnesia. These are the standard plot devises of soap opera fare. The film runs a little long, but there is no stretch of film that rings true.

Boys who love video games might like this film, but the story is lame and the massive expense for special effects could have supported the making of a dozen good movies. It's a dud.",ligonlaw,12/15/13,2013

Vin you'd better work on your muscles quickly, I am worried The Rock might take your place as Riddick in the near future.To sum all things up, this movie is a fun ride, great action scenes, decent acting, and I am proud the director Justin Lin is a Taiwanese!",joechang-1,5/26/13,2013
568,7,Knows its audience and works well as a result,"There is something for films that know their place in life. Sometime blockbusters will try and dress themselves up as something more worthy or important than they are but with this sixth film there is no risk of that accusation being made about the Fast & Furious franchise, because this film certainly is no under no illusions about what it needs to do. As a result we get a very simple crowd pleasing film with plenty of big ridiculous action, very easy characters and plotting and plenty to look at. This isn't to say that it isn't nonsense or that it performs in any way other than the very limited parameters it sets for itself, but at least it is honest with itself and the viewers.To speak of the strengths first, the action is not only well executed but it is also enjoyably silly in how OTT it is. At times it hurts itself by trying to make a serious moment out of a ridiculous one (such as Dominic's mid-air Matrix moment with Letty) but mostly it goes big and doesn't do anything to hide that it is just having fun and we should too. The plot really only exists to create some frame for the action and to be honest the film could have benefited from losing 20 minutes of plotting and making more room for more of what it does best. There are too many scenes of discussion between characters; in a normal film I may complain about action pushing these out, but here I think more should have been cut as really I cared for nobody and it added nothing. The plot is also full of nonsense; the 25 mile long runway is the one that people mention, but there is loads of stuff that makes no sense but mostly, like the runway, you go with it because it is dumb fun.The cast are best when they remember this too – but too often the material pushes them to try and ""act"" and few of them can. Diesel continues to lack charisma but in a way it is nice he has found something to do. Likewise Walker, not a man with much range, he seems very at home in this franchise and he is pretty I guess. Johnson is a walking mountain who has a lot of charisma and presence even though his character makes no sense. Gibson is fun, Luda is so-so and Kang is fine but oddly tragic throughout. In terms of the female roles, although there was still some gratuitous shots of models, there seemed to be fewer and less of a sense of objectifying. Rodriguez is OK but I liked the presence of Carano – not much of an actress but good physical presence. Gadot is gorgeous while Brewster is wisely left out of it as the abundance of character baggage is obvious.This is not a good film by any means – it is ridiculous in its action and really doesn't care about the plot at all, but if you feel the same way then there is much to enjoy. It could easily have lost 20 minutes of narrative and be been for it, but when the action is going on it is very easy to switch off the brain and enjoy it. Yes it is aiming its sights low and simple, but sometimes it is nice when a film is honest with you and then delivers all it promises.",bob the moo,9/14/13,2013
570,7,All Roads lead to this.,"Fast and Furious 6.Well the movie carries one hell of a explosive punch. The Stunts are top notch. The Acting is petty good. If you are a fan of the Fast and Furious franchise you'll consider this one of the best in the series. If you are not a fan you won't be pleased . simple as that. I like this franchise. Right from the first one to this one. I consider them to be examples of high action and adventure done in a classic way. The story is simple. Supercop Hobbs is chasing a criminal named Shaw. Shaw uses a crew like Dom's to perform impossible robberies. Shaw is the master of the roads. Hobbs finds out that Shaw's Second in Command is Dom's lost love Letty long presumed dead. When Shaw and his crew steal a high tech Chip. Hobbes goes to Rio and recruits Dom and his team with a promise of a full pardon for them. So they can return Home. Dom pulls his team together and they get to work bring down Shaw. The theme of Fast and Furious that has been constant is family. And it is strongly put into play with this film. As Dom tells Brian. ""You don't turn your back on family. Even when they turn their back on you."" For Brian it's about getting a dangerous criminal off the streets and returning home. For Dom it's about putting his family together and resuming his life back in L.A. But it's also for Dom about the truth. nothing else matters. The film is sleek . And well done ,It's done with a style and flair you will enjoy. That is if you are a fan. If you're not a fan well check this film out anyways. It's also one hell of a crime noir film . You can forget the cars and you still have a well written well acted crime film. Vin Diesal gives a pretty sharp performance as Dom as always. Paul Walker provides the moral compass of the family. And Dwayne Johnson Provides the spark that gets them into action. Each actor in this film knows his or her job. The film ties in Fast and Furious :Tokyo drift. And it sets up the next one. The series as a whole fits into one whole story. A very impressive feat. Like I said if you're a fan of the franchise you'll enjoy it. If you're not Fan well give it a chance anyways. If you want to be surprised.",bluesman-20,12/18/13,2013
571,7,Exciting mechanics,"We don't watch these for the superb insights, do we? The storytelling is mechanical and simple, recycled from spare parts of other movies, here a dark caper that owes both to Bond and Nolan. The plan is to know enough at any given moment, and very crisply, to know where we are in the larger vista, except the parts moved by the villain which carry the surprises.It's all so we can lunge ahead with what we came to see: motion mechanics.This is my go-to franchise for expertly calibrated precision in the cinematic engine. I'm not even a gearhead, the whole world with its thuggish posing is far from my sensibility. I just like to watch. The container may be simple and dumb but the pure energy it creates in the eye excites me to no end, this is stuff I want to see. Expert work in the edits, impacts, gravity. Just so you know, the editing team is headed by a guy who has worked for Bay, John Woo in M:I 2, and Tony Scott. To have these astounding stunts, it means we're going to have corresponding leaps in story logic. We do, some truly mind-numbing ones. Remember the opening of Goldeneye with Bond diving off the cliff after that plane? We have several more ridiculous stunts here—the pinnacle is perhaps the one where Diesel flies several feet in the air from a speeding car, catches in mid-air his loved one who is about to plunge to her death, and they roll together on the opposite side of the highway. (This connection between visual and logical leaps is metaphysical, but more on that in other comments)It's ludicrous of course, but I can buy it because it is the pinnacle of a very clearly mapped urge to have her back. And this is also why the stunts work so well; it's the same very clearly mapped linear narrative space, usually streets and cars snaking after each other, within that linear action space we have constant explosions in the eye—Tony Scott terrain, Unstoppable being the appex. French Connection is the template of this thing, with its big chase in three linear vistas, a film I like more because it carries the same 'real' gravity to the cop story, whereas this is M:I crazy. Which is why the finale with the plane fizzles into noise, it's just messy visual information, the sort that Bay deals in.",chaos-rampant,7/21/13,2013
572,7,"fast6, then a 7?","Okay when the original ""fast and the furious"" came out i thought it was decent the acting was decent, but really, now i think that the only reason why we all go to see this series is for the women and car races. But now i feel that the series is losing its fire just like ""paranormal activity"" only Idiots and dumb people would go see that series and waste money. Anyways now the ""fast and the furious"" series is more like a adventure movie were either they get screwed over or they have to do a job for the government.I think the reason why they decided to add Statham in the mix with D'wane Johnson was to try and revive a dead story line that they screwed up on by making ""Tokyo drift"", and decided to run a prequel off that though it does end by them going to Tokyo but if the studios decide to make more i think nobody will go and see it due to the lack of interest they might have in the story if it continues",hawaiiwarrior08,6/23/13,2013
573,7,"More NOS, Less Plot","What has beautiful women, fast cars, comedy, and action? No I'm not talking about a college spring break in Miami, Florida; I'm talking about the latest installment in the Fast and Furious Franchise. Last night two of my buddies and I had the privilege of seeing an early showing of Furious 6, and like always I have plenty to say. Let's get started.For those who saw Fast Five, you know that Brian (Paul Walker) and Mia (Jordana Brewster) were expecting their first child, Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew were all millionaires and Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) was ""searching"" for them. Number six picks up pretty much two months later, showing how the heist crew, minus the two demolition experts, are enjoying their well-earned rewards. In F&F world though, nothing every remains quiet for long as a ghost from the past, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) stirs the embers of intrigue and revenge in Dom resulting in the team coming together to find her. Now let's start the review.The opening of this movie is a bit slow at the beginning, but provides enough laughs and information to refresh old fans memory of the plot, while making a small foundation for those new to the series. After a ridiculous interrogation scene, a rushed planning scenes, and some more jokes later, bam we get to our first action scene. Now you might be thinking, oh great another loud sequence of cars rushing through the road sending pedestrians and bystanders dodging to the sides. For the most part you are right, but this time they are chasing after a band of mercenaries led by Luke Evans attempting to steal some government secret weapon component. While this goal is not the most unique, it's at least a slight change up to the typical motives behind the adrenaline pumping, engine roaring speed fest that we've seen for the last thirteen years. The stunts are still impressive, the cars so sleek and beautiful it hurts, and the music so aggressive that it blends into an exciting ride. Of course this wouldn't be worthy of being an F&F movie if there was only one chase scene right Don't worry number six has a few more car scenes that continue to show off the world of stunt driving, CGI and mediocre plots centered around finding ways to make cars go fast.One should note though that the action isn't just limited to cars. Nope F&F6 opens has taken the liberty to add more diversity in their butt kicking arsenal. With the Rock taking more screen time, fans get to see a few more fist fights and body slamming that allows you to see what the Rock is cooking. When Johnson isn't putting the hurt on someone, the rest of the gang takes their shots at either putting a cap in someone, or pulling out some martial arts skills to defeat their opponents. Some of these fights rock, while others are merely meant to have you laughing as the heroes throw out witty banter. Despite some of the ridiculousness and over the top stunts, the action will still have action fans on the edge of their seats, hooting for their favorite characters.Putting the action aside though, the movie does have other qualities that help balance things out. For one thing the comedy in this movie is still strong, especially when Roman (Tyrese Gibson) takes the stage. The feisty, self-involved, ladies' man is the center of the comedic pillar pulling all the other characters in to a friendly rivalry that symbolizes the brotherhood between the team. From my standpoint, I think Gibson must make these jokes daily, as the acting made it seem that it was just an ordinary day, especially when going toe to toe with Tej (Ludacris).For me the comedy also helped make up for some of the plot holes this movie had. The lack of reasoning behind Evans attacks left me feeling as this guy was just crazy. The plot revolving around Dom and Letty though was the better developed of the story, with much of the movie focusing on the internal struggles occurring between the two. While the romance is not my favorite part, the movie does a good job not rubbing love in my face, and actually uses the plot to bring in other ghosts from the pasts to strengthen the movie. Laughs and love aside, the movie also does a nice job keeping you on your toes as to who will survive the ordeal. Many times there are close calls where you are not sure if someone will live, and yes there are even some deaths that upset my friends, despite how predictable it was. All in all though, the plot isn't the worst thing I've seen, it just was lacking in some areas that I felt failed where the fifth one succeeded. Luckily we still have a nice balance of characters/actors in the movie, with the exception of a few who took a major back seat to Dom and Letty, (i.e. Mia, Tej, and Elena). While the action was impressive, the camera work still had a few spastic moments that were either a bit dizzying or a bit annoying. As for the villain, again the guy had skills and a lethal team, but they failed to really build him up or give him some pizazz to make him stand out as a great bad guy. Regardless F&F6 is a good movie and keeps the series alive for at least one more movie to come, watch the credits. Acting is just like before, the action is still rip roaring fun, and the comedy is golden to keep you laughing the whole time. Yet some weaknesses in plot and centering on Letty/Dom hindered this movie to make it less enjoyable for me. My scores are below: Action/Crime/Thriller: 7.5 Movie: 7.0",rgkarim,5/24/13,2013
