8.0,Evo? Where'd you get an Evo from?,"Story/Plot - Brian O'Conner (Walker) is an ex cop and along with his partner Roman Pearce (Gibson) they set on a job to transport dirty money for a shady Miami criminal Carter Verone (Hauser). However O'Conner and Pearce are working undercover for the police and are on a mission to bring Verone down.

Equipped with high powered cars and their wits they take on the challenge and work together to bring this criminal to his end.

My verdict - Loved this film and the combination of Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson worked a treat. The lovely Eva Mendes was as pleasing to the eye as always. The story line was fantastic. Go undercover and work for the drug exporter and then bring him down whilst saving the girl. Plus doing all this in a modded Mitsubishi Evo and Mitsubishi Spyder, amazing cars and the exhaust tones were pleasing to the ear.",LostInFilmUK,2013-02-14,2013
5.0,Superficial at best,"What disturbed me about this movie, was that Singleton helmed it! The director of ""Boyz n the Hood"", and ""Higher Learning"". Well, those clearly were films with some talent in characters. But this one ? I know that this movie was produced clearly without much if any attention to acting. Remar, I hold accountable especially. With 24 years in the biz ? His ""acting"" hasn't gotten any better. Stiff, emotion-less, and autonomous. Either Singleton was too pre-occupied with aesthetics, or was too polite to ask for any emotions. Did Singleton just skip rehearsals and print the first and only takes ? I don't know, but I guess mediocre acting in a action film is too much to ask for. The villain was over-hyped to be so formidable. He was far from that. I find it hard to buy that stock. He doesn't have scores of henchmen or indulges in wanton, sadistic, violence arbitrarily. So aside from any acting, if you're a motorhead like me, the cars are the only characters who give any semblance of talent.",nvjs,2013-03-24,2013
5.0,2 Fast But 2 Formulaic,"""Boyz N the Hood"" director John Singleton's ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" should have been called ""2 Fast 2 Formulaic."" Vin Diesel skipped this routine crime thriller about smuggling that lacks the soul and substance of ""The Fast and the Furious."" Meantime, Paul Walker reprises his character. Illegal street racing still serves as a backdrop for this predictable but smoothly mounted melodrama about smuggling. Nevertheless, nothing here indicates where the considerably ret00led franchise would go after ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift."" Producer Neal Moritz has a cameo as a cop driving a fast car. Scenarists Michael Brandt and Derek Haas have appropriated the characters created by Gary Scott Thompson for this follow-up film.

In ""2 Fast 2 Furious,"" former LAPD Detective Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker of ""Programmed to Kill"") has left Los Angeles and is struggling to keep a low profile in Miami, Florida. Unfortunately, Brian needs some bread, and he accepts Tej's offer for a race one night. Tej Parker (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges of ""The Wash"") gives him four minutes to get to the race. Thirty-five hundred dollars is up for grabs, and Brian outraces three fleet opponents: Suki, Slap Jack, and Orange Julius in a neck-in-neck race that culminates with them hurdling airborne over a raised bridge. Of course, since Dominic Toretto doesn't win since he isn't competing, but O'Conner does. Slap Jack (Michael Ealy) skids out of control, leaves the track, and slams into a Pepsi sign. No sooner than they have completed this impromptu course than the FBI and U.S. Customs agents appear. Poor Brian winds up in police custody with a suspicious cop, Agent Markham (James Remar of ""The Warriors""), looking down his throat. Bad blood exists between these two throughout the 107 minutes of this opus. Bilkins (Thom Barry) offers Brian a deal that will clear him. Like Brian, Bilkins is the only other holdover from the original film. The Feds have a device that they use to stop cars dead in their tracks that appeared only in this film. They fire a triple-pronged device that they can operate by remote control that shuts down the car's electrical system. No such device is available, but it does bolster the suspense in the racing scenes.

This time around, the FBI want to clap the handcuffs on a big-time dealer, Carter Verone (Cole Hauser of ""Pitch Black""), but Verone is too slippery for them. He has a couple of nasty bodyguards, Roberto (Roberto 'Sanz' Sanchez) and Enrique (Mo Gallini), carrying out his commands. The Feds have a deep, undercover agent, sexy Monica (Eva Mendiz of ""Training Day), working with him. Markham tries to force Brian to work with Agent Dunn, but our protagonist exposes Dunn as too stupid. He grills him about a Gallo engine. Naturally, the ignorant FBI knows nothing about cars, and the Feds rethink their plans and remove Dunn. Incidentally, Brian asked about Gallo because Dunn was drinking from a cup labeled Gallo's Pizza. Instead, Brian selects a former friend, Roman Pearce (Tryese Gibson of ""Baby Boy""), who still harbors a grudge against our hero.

Brian and Roman join Carter's gang after they prove they can drive like Hell. Carter auditions several hotshot drivers and asks them to careen to a compound some 20 miles away to where his red Ferrari is parked with an envelope in the glove box. They are to retrieve the envelop and bring it back to him. Naturally, Brian and Roman double-team and beat everybody else. Unfortunately, they get the surprise of their lives when the suspicious Markham shows up at the last minute.

Nevertheless, our heroes get back and discover that all they've gotten for Carter is a fat cigar. Carter is a cigar smoking fiend with his own personal cutter that Roman tries to steal without luck. Like its characters, ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" contains more nuance than depth. The characters are more interesting than the lackluster plot. Although Carter is as suspicious of Brian and Roman as Agent Markham is, Carter isn't the equivalent of a James Bond villain. He dresses immaculately and talks tough, but he doesn't get behind the wheel of a car and spin out. He is like a colorless, low-class Scarface type. Cole Hauser makes him look tough, but the scribes fail to make him memorable. The big finale has Brian leaping his car and crashing it into Carter's yacht as the kingpin villain tries to escape. At fade out, Bilkins honors his proposition to clear them. Not only does he leave them with cars, but also our heroes who were carrying stacks of dough use their illicit loot to open a garage in Miami.

Clearly, ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" found the franchise on idle. Who would have thought that this franchise would have opened up after Dom returned in ""Fast and Furious?""",zardoz-13,2013-03-27,2013
6.24,Decent Entertainment But Not As Good As the First,"2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)** 1/2 (out of 4)Sequel to THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS has former cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) pulled back into the game when he's asked to go undercover and link a drug dealer to some flowing cash. O'Conner brings in his buddy Roman (Tyrese Gibson) as the two try to bring down the drug dealer so that their records will be cleared. I think it's safe to say that John Singleton is pretty much above this type of material and I think his inexperience in the genre somewhat hurts the picture. There's no question that the man knows how to tell a story and I think he does a great job with just about everything in the picture except for the car races and stunts. The one area where this sequel is really lacking is in regards to the races because they all look rather poor. A lot of this can be blamed on how they're shot and I also wasn't too impressed with the editing during these scenes. It really did seem as if they didn't film anything in a good way so they had to cover it up with the editing. Another bad thing is when the cars hit their ""turbo"" we're given some very bad effects with all the scenery getting blurry. This here just doesn't work. The rest of the film I thought was pretty good as we're given characters we like and there's no question that there's plenty of eye candy at work. Walker and Gibson are both good in their parts as they share some nice chemistry and both manage to play it cool. Eva Mendes doesn't get too much to do except try out a good looking bikini, which I'm sure will be enough for most. The rest of the supporting players are good in their parts including Cole Hauser as the bad guy as Ludicrous as a racing buddy. At just 108-minutes the film never overstays its welcome and director Singleton at least keeps the film moving at a nice pace. The story itself is downright idiotic but this is a popcorn movie after all so it's not that big of a deal.",Michael_Elliott,2013-04-07,2013
6.0,Not as fast and furious as the first but OK still nonetheless.,"2 Fast 2 Furious is in many, many ways a far inferior film to it's predecessor The Fast and the Furious. But what it does have, is a certain likability to it, which i don't fully understand.Returning star Paul Walker, playing ex-under cop turned fugitive Brian O'Conner has a chance to redeem himself and with the help of child hood friend Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) bring down drug lord Carter Verone (Cole Hauser). It brings what is expected for the film, Sexy ladies wearing skimpy outfits, men who look good with their tops off, and extremely fast cars. As already stated the film is worse than the first in a lot ways, the acting is pretty poor throughout the cast, particularly Cole Hauser who was a bad choice for the antagonist. As for me he failed to express a methodical calculating bag guy which i think he was going for. The film also move towards CGI green screen with it's effects which take away from some of the original's appeal, and making it look worse that the first also.Good things about the film are the two leads do share a pretty easy going chemistry with each other, which made some their bickering scenes fun to watch. It also brings in the appealing Eva Mendes after her kind of breakthrough role in the film Training Day. Some of the action scenes and car chases were very good though. They did feel a bit Michael Bay like. Making me think John Singleton may have gone to him for advice before making this, and what ever you think about Bay, his actions scenes are usually well choreographed. A Film i can understand why some people will hate, but i have to say i had to much fun watching to dislike it.",paulsrobinson,2013-05-21,2013
6.24,2 times the fast 2 times the furious but still not better than the original.,"This film brings back more of what we loved from the first film with all the cars, girls, and action and multiplies it. However it is still inferior to the first film but that dosen't mean it isn't awesome. This movie has gotten a lot of criticism and i don't understand why there is so much hate for this movie. Some people complained about the lack of plot and the casts acting skills but I don't care about that. I watch these Fast films to be entertained and I was throughly entertained with this one. Even though it dosen't match up to the original it still excels in excitement. I mean how could you go wrong with taking the series to Miami were our eyes will be blessed with dozens of beautiful beach girls. And the races in this movie are also very exciting to. And let's not forget the awesome chase sequence in the film as well. Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson make a great team and show us why this movie is so cool. I still love this movie despite the many negative reviews I've seen and to all the haters I say forget about the plot and just enjoy the perks. This movie is made for entertainment not Oscar awards and as far as entertainment goes It was grade A popcorn style.",daniel_velker,2013-05-23,2013
7.0,2 Fast but not so Furious,"Before I start about anything. I was little disappointed with this movie. So second movie of The Fast and the Furious franchise didn't full my expectations. Brian is the only one of the main characters who stays in this film from the last film crew. The plot get little bit more action then the last movie so they filled up that part. They put the bad guy, so it gets some action. You still got some badass cars, but it is not about tuning this time. Races from 1/4 of a mile sprint now evolve into circuit races and highway chasing and running from police. The film is mainly about undercover mission to catch that bad guys similar to the last movie, but I miss that there is no one else from the old crew. Still this movie deserve 7, and current rate is underrated. Watch this movie, it won't have much roll into plot in later movie, don't have high expectations and you will like it. It is still worth seeing.",BearGlove,2013-05-28,2013
8.0,Not as good as the first but still entertaining.,"2 Fast 2 Furious isn't quite as good as the first film but it's still a really good movie in its own right. The cast was great once again with Paul Walker returning to his role as Brian O'Connor and Tyrese Gibson and Eva Mendes adding new character dynamics. Tyrese in particular was great. If there's one thing the first film lacked it's that there wasn't much humor. It was a very serious film and while that's great, Tyrese's character, Roman Pearce, added some great laughs at some unexpected moments. The cinematic effects were much better in this film also. The only negatives were that some of the action sequences were a little overboard (Dukes of Hazard jump for example) and the dialogue had too much street car jargon to the extent that some of it felt forced. ""That Yenko will snap a speedo in 5 seconds"" is an example of the type of dialogue that doesn't actually feel genuine in its placement in the film. Nonetheless, a really good movie with solid acting and great action.",Bruce722,2013-06-02,2013
7.0,"More Like A Spin Off Than A Sequel,","2 Fast 2 Furious is a good movie with a very thought out storyline and a decent cast.It is the first of many sequels to The Fast And The Furious but this time around it is only Paul Walker.Brian O'Conner was suppose to be the star in the first one,but Vin Diesel ends up stealing the show,and is absence from this doesn't help the movie out.I did like how Paul Walker got the spotlight he deserves this time however,because there is no actor in this good enough to steal the show,I know Ludicrous is a big star,but hes not a very good actor.Fans of the original will be disappointed,but can still enjoy this sequel,but there are much fewer car chases.Brian O'Connor must investigate and find a local drug-lord with some help with an old friend from college or else he will be put into jail for letting Dominic escape from them in the first Fast and Furious.",lesleyharris30,2013-06-08,2013
7.0,More entertaining and colorful than the first.,"Ah, the one with the infamous sequel title. Directed by... John Singleton? Odd choice, but I'll take him over Rob Cohen I guess. Where the first film was POINT BREAK WITH CARS, this one is Miami VICE WITH CARS so... Aw, to hell with it. This was way better than the first. Like the title implies, it's bigger, more colorful and more absurd. Once again Paul Walker isn't the most charismatic leading actor to grace the screen (Ludacris has more charisma, let's put it that way), but at least they're not trying to give him some dramatic soap opera nonsense. Now he's just a guy who drives really good, a cypher that audiences can easily project themselves to. There's some conflict between him and Tyrese Gibson, but it's more banter than anything else. The whole thing is brainless, but there's a measure of color and absurdity that makes it watchable, certainly more than the last one.",tmm_8705,2013-06-28,2013
7.0,I found this more enjoyable then the first,"Really liked the opening of this movie.Great intense race scenes, I loved that first race scenes was great and very tense at times. The whole movie was really fast paced and it wasn't really action packed from start to end, there had some story in the middle. I'm not sure about the torture scenes, it seem a little odd in this movie and they also added some humour in this movie. FBI wanted Brian O'Connor team with old buddy Dominic but we know it not going start of well as they need to team and go under cover to bring down a Miami drug exporter in exchange for clear records. Some great action sequence in this movie I found this more enjoyable then the first.",atinder,2013-07-24,2013
6.24,2 Fake,"I like most of the Fast & Furious stuff to varying degrees, for some expert mechanics in the camera and nothing more. Once Vin Diesel came back on board, the stories 'matured' to just generic crime stuff, losing the youthful world, on the other hand the mechanical execution improved.This is poor in the usual, expected ways, it is intended for a teenage audience so the dynamics reflect a teenage understanding of how things work. You'll see that in just the opening race, where no one is older than 25, the race takes place through empty streets, with no actual life anywhere. Miraculously how, kids have bust into the control room of a lifting bridge which they lift to spice up the race, just like that. And in the end the parent-cops show up to break off the party.In the end, who cares about a stupid plot with a drug kingpin? I'd love to see a film like this that just revels in the hyper world of mindless chrome, girls, music and engine roar, a Spring Breakers of cars that didn't sugarcoat the danger to soul. Tokyo Drift came close, but again no.But what really kills this, all else conceded, is how devastatingly poor is the racing action. It would vastly improve in the next one, and over time, as the special effects, editing and production design teams would gradually change. But here the maker and his team embarrass themselves. The motion detail, backgrounds, impacts, and virtual camera in the driving are on a Power Rangers level. Nearly all of them were replaced for Tokyo Drift, for good reason.This is the Batman and Robin of the franchise, lame from start to finish, and coming so early it's a miracle it didn't kill it off.",chaos-rampant,2013-07-28,2013
7.0,I didn't miss Vin Diesel,"And people acclaiming that this flick sucks because Vin Diesel isn't in it, sorry but Cole Hauser (Carter Verone) did a hell of a job and was more believable then Vin. Nevertheless, I liked this flick more then part 1 just because we do see old timers like the Dodge Charger and the Chevrolet Yenko doing their stuff. But to be honest, it's not all about cars, the story has to be good too and this time the story was more suspenseful without the cheap clichÃ©s from part 1.Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is no thrown out of service as a cop due the end of part 1 and so this picks in on that ending. But of course the cops need a good driver and Brian is asked to do the job, he will only if his old friend Roman Pierce (Tyrese Gibson) can join him. And so their of to a mission with undercover agent Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes). I liked the acting especially from Cole and the two friends Brian and Roman. Eva Mendes sadly couldn't attract me to her character. She wasn't convincing and for me was just in this flick to show her body which she does a few times. The effects used were sometimes pure CGI but it didn't bother me at all and there were some nice stunts done with the cars. Maybe the ending with the boat and the car was a bit exaggerated. I just don't get it why everybody was asking for Vin to return (which he did). He outpriced himself here in part 2. Here the characters did work. Whatever, people may say what they want but this one I liked except for Eva Mendes.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",trashgang,2013-09-18,2013
10.0,Best Fast & Furious So Far Honestly,"Okay so what really counts is realism in my opinion. When he's revving the engine out and actually doing more than 100mph, I want the speedometer to report accurately. It's a little unrealistic but hey it's still a fun movie! The muscle car races are excellent and I recommend the movie to most people who enjoy fast cars and cute girls. The next movie should include more extended periods of engines revving and exhaust like the movie ""Bullet"". That movie had one of the most epic car chases ever on camera. Key point being realism, they actually video taped them in real life. Not in a CGI booth etc. More engines, revving, and lots of revving and volume! Rumbling of the exhaust of the engines. So in the theater we not only see the fast cars, but FEEL the engines rumbling in our seats. How about a movie that the guy is a test driver, he's running super sports cars across the nation from new york, to California. California to Bahamas etc while all the way bad guys are attempting to steal the cars. That's when verone and dahm and the gang come in to escort them across the nation. High speed racing across the nation like ""Cannonball Run""!!! Shelby Cobra GT500s or 1979 porsche 959, or 1995 lamborghini countach, or 1995 Ferrari F50... Cool amazing classics!!! Lots of flames from the exhaust and lots of cute girls screaming and enjoying the ride!!! Good LUCK!",jeff-horton09,2013-10-18,2013
4.0,missed Vin Diesel,"Vin Diesel is gone. Almost everybody is gone. Only Paul Walker is back and he looks alone. It's sad to see this. Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) is no longer with the police force. Miami police wants him to go undercover to bring down drug lord Carter Verone (Cole Hauser). They already have undercover agent Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) in the gang. She introduces Brian and his friend Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) as the new drivers.How does this compare to the first? This depends on what you liked about the original. If you liked the pretty cars, then this one has more and faster and furiouser racing. If the first one was about the characters and the chemistry between Walker and Diesel, then this one is a big step backwards. It's nothing more than a lot of car chases and there are other movies that do it a lot better. The characters don't hold much interest.",SnoopyStyle,2013-11-09,2013
5.0,A nice sequel...,"""2 Fast 2 Furious"" is the sequel of ""The Fast and the Furious"" and I think that it was a little worse than the first one. In this movie we have again the ""classic"" gang but a new person arrives and this is Tyrese Gibson who plays as Roman Pearce a friend from the childhood of Brian O'Conner. They both want to clear their records and to do that they have to find and bring down a Miami drug exporter.I liked very much the interpretation of Eva Mendes as she is a new person in this movie and I think that Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson did their best to make this movie entertaining and interesting but in some moments I got a little bored. I believe that the first movie had more action than this one and that was something that I did not like it.",Thanos_Alfie,2013-11-10,2013
5.0,This movie came 2 Fast and 2 Furious without thinking if it's going to be a good movie. This movie crashed and burned.,"When the original 2001's The Fast and the Furious opened, it was the surprise hit of the summer and then become one of the largest selling DVDs of that year. So in it was no brainer for Universal to make a follow up film. Unfortunately things didn't go the way, the studio and fans of the film would have liked it. First off, the movie biggest draw, star Vin Diesel wasn't in it, due to him wanting a bigger paycheck. After Diesel dropped out, Rob Cohen, director of The Fast and the Furious, also dropped out of the sequel and replace by John Singleton. The movie decided to go on without them with Paul Walker, the only star returning for the sequel. Don't get me wrong, Paul Walker isn't the worst actor, but in no way, can he carry the film on his own. His acting is mediocre, at best. Rest in Peace, Paul Walker. It's not like Vin Diesel is any better. What the film need was two leading stars that can work best off each other. This movie didn't had them. Tyrese Gibson was OK in his role, as Brian O'Conner's (Paul Walker) new partner ex-con buddy Roman Pearce, but his character was more annoying than charming. Tyrese brings a lot of well needed humor is this film that is, for the most part, fairly dry. He was more bruins than brains. Roman shooting at a DEA agent at one point in the movie seem really stupid, but they love to play it off as smart, because it was done to not blow their cover. If a real undercover cop shot at the law, no way, would they be freed. They would be jail or shot at site. Most of the rest of the cast aren't really worth mentioning. The villain is forgettable. The two leading ladies such as Devon Aoki who plays Suki in the film and Eva Mendes are mostly eye candy. The film focuses too much on the scantily clad babe, anyways. The story goes like this, after the events of the first movie, ex-cop Brian is forced out of the police department for letting the criminal go. When he is caught by the police again after series of street racing, he is recruited by them to track down a cruel Miami import/export dealer Carter Verone (Cole Hauser) exchange for his records to be cleaned. Most of the action scenes are pretty laughable and unrealistic. The audition scene was just bizarre. You have a dealer trying to keep a low public profile as possible as he goes about conducting his business, but instead of a quiet audition, he sends a bunch of his drivers to race on a public daylight freeway simply to determine which of them would be the most reliable driver to help him sneak his laundered money out of the country! The Verone's money laundry scene where Tej, Jimmy and Suki, and many other street racers, create a diversion that allows O'Conner and Pearce to sneak away in different cars is so awfully bad ridiculous. The car racing culture portrayed in this movie doesn't exist. Sure, people race cars, but do they have several thousand people watching it, without the cops knowing. No way. Even if they did do it, there is no way for a race to be that long, in real life, without hitting traffic. The charm of the original, were some realistic racing scenes. Most of those in the sequel are done on computer with only the actors placed in motionless cars against a blue screen in order to add the CGI later on. The racing scenes are so fake CGI looking. Another thing, just because you have nitro in your tank doesn't make you go into light speed, Han Solo. As a car guy, the cars in this movie was just too gimmicky like the whole pink Anime car or the Orange Julius car with televisions. Real gear heads would know that Neon lightning was bad for racing. The convertible is a poor choice for racing since they are weaker, more prone to flexing, and are heavier than a normal hard top car. A race car wouldn't have fancy neon lightning, sound systems, or gadgets like that. A real race car would be stripped down to save weight. Heating, A/C, safety systems, low emission systems, and yes, television would be gone to make the car, faster. People that decorate their cars are ricing or Ricers. Not good racers at all. Rear spoilers just hinder performance for front wheel drive cars. The choice of cars are bad. They are not even fast in a modern sense, unless you count 85 mph as fast, compare to other cars at the time reaching 140 mph. I didn't like the camera shots, such as the upside down scenes. Why were there in the first place? It wasn't that too. First off, I'm in disbelief that this was directed by John Singleton. A promising young black director back when 1991's Boyz in the Hood appeared, he has now been completely quiet by Hollywood. This movie make minorities look like dumb thugs without any substance. Most of the supporting cast, like Tej Parker (Ludacris), and Roman Pearce would return in the oncoming sequels of this movie franchise such as 2011's Fast Five and 2013's Fast and the Furious 6. Did this high-octane thrill ride run out of gas? No, but it was indeed mindless entertainment. Over analyzing a movie that was intended to be mindless fun seem pointless, but this things need to be pointed out. It looks like a video games, but even Grand Theft Auto and Need for Speed had a better story than this. Not recommended, except if you're a car addict, even so you might find this bad. It's probably the worst of the Fast & Furious movies, so far. So drive away, and get Fast Five or Fast 6, instead.",ironhorse_iv,2013-12-10,2013
4.0,More Of The Same,Wow a sequel to a film that didn't have enough material to fill out 90 minutes in any satisfying way and appeared to be a feature length video from MTV . How would a film company approach this from a different angle ? Bare in mind that this was before 3-D was making a come back so fleecing cinema audiences by charging them slightly more for the loan of special specs wasn't an option so the producers have made the exact same film about a former cop who is addicted to speed racing infiltrate a criminal gang except this time they've changed the location from Los Angeles to Miami . Wow that is like so totally awesome dude . It says something that the average cinema goer seems more inventive than the people who work in Hollywood . Do I have to write any more . I should have just copied and pasted my review on the original film and no one would have noticed any difference . I didn't notice any difference between this movie and the first one . Well apart from the fact that bald muscle bound non actor wasn't in it,Theo Robertson,2014-02-21,2014
6.0,Almost as equally entertaining as the first film,"With the help of Paul Walker and Vin Diesel's chemistry and some intense racing scenes, Rob Cohen's The Fast and the Furious (2001) was an instant hit among racing fans. And like most franchises with critical financial success, a sequel started to be put into the works. Similar to many other sequels, it was distributed two years later and it's difficult to say whether it pleased fans as much as the first one did. According to this site, this is lowest score the franchise has. It wasn't bad at all but it was missing a few elements of the first movie, which left a more entertaining feeling.The story follows ex-cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) back to Miami from Los Angeles where he's enjoying his time racing street cars only to be pulled back by the authorities that he dropped. Heading the authorities is Agent Bilkins (Thom Barry) from the first installment and this time he wants O'Conner back one more time to take down a drug lord. And O'Conner can't refuse because he'd go to jail if he didn't accept. Plus, if the drug lord is turned in, all of his criminal charges will disappear. Why does this plot sound like Vin Diesel's xXx (2002) plot line (except it doesn't deal with a drug lord)? Speaking of which, why didn't Vin Diesel return? That's one thing that this franchise consistently needs. Paul Walker is the central character but Vin Diesel's presence was the icing on the cake.Is was nice though that the writers kept the continuity together. The characters do reference material from the first film which shows the producers want to keep the story going and not divert completely from the original. But if there's one thing that comes into question, it is the concept of getting caught having a love interest in the business. This happened in the first movie and it blew O'Conners cover. Here the same thing happens in a similar way. You'd think the lesson was learned. Sigh. The new interest is Eva Mendes and she plays her character well enough. Accompanying O'Conner is Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) an old friend who originally has a grudge for some of his own issues. Even with this though, their chemistry works well.Playing the drug lord is another interesting actor - Cole Hauser. He has a very smooth deep voice and resembles a very young Tom Berenger. He's also able to make his character seem dangerous enough to hurt someone. That's it for characters. The music produced by David Arnold of Stargate (1994) sounded better than BT's score from the first film but it wasn't evident enough. Barely heard a thing. As for action scenes, the racing is still fast paced and contains much of the same film making as the first, which kept the feeling the same. Other than that, the story feels the same as before but without Vin Diesel. It's not a bad follow up to the first movie, but not casting Vin Diesel wasn't smart - it's like missing a piece to a puzzle.

6.0,2 Fast and 2 Vigorous,"I haven't watched the first Fast and Furious movie and this sequel was actually the first one in the series that I have watched. From what I recall, it is a somewhat fun movie about former cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) who teams up with ex-con Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) to defeat Miami-based drug dealer Carter Verone (Cole Hauser).This movie has that an adrenaline rush that gives you an edge-of-your-seat excitement, with the entire racing sequences a heart-pounding and vigorous experience. The plot about trying to bring in the ex-con gives the film a touch of suspense and intrigue.The acting was all right, but I thought some of the characters, especially the girls, didn't serve a real purpose in the movie other than providing eye-candy. There isn't a good deal of character development and I thought the rap music and people trying to act cool were annoying.Watch this movie for the race scenes and the trying-to-catch-the-bad-guy element, but don't expect too much from the overall acting.Grade C+",OllieSuave-007,2014-08-11,2014
8.0,A good Action Movie,"This movie has been getting real mixed reviews .... personally, I like this movie. I thought 2 Fast 2 Furious was a damn good movie. I thought the storyline was pretty cool it is about fast cars, hot women, cool guys, and tells us what happens to Brian O'Connor (Paul walker) after the 'open' ending of the first movie. There are absolutely awesome action shots and much movement in the plot to make it interesting to watch. To those of you who thought it was not really good, maybe you should watch it again and give it a another shot, it really is a good movie. The only thing i personally didn't like is that Vin Diesel was not in this movie. But he comes back in the new movies so thats good.",heatherwthurman,2014-11-10,2014
2.0,2 Fast 2 Furious,"2 much bling 2 much ka-ching! the hyper neon lit sequel bursts onto your screen dripping in so much hip hop/rap culture you'd think they were trying to tell us something. Seriously this film is uber ridiculous, its like a toy commercial, a comic book, its the 'Batman and Robin' and 'Batman Forever' of the car chase genre. I was looking to see if Joel Schumacher had a hand in this eye sore.

The initial street racer sequence is the prime example of how utterly cheap and tacky this film is. Each racer is colour coordinated to their car, in other words one female driver is dressed head to toe in shocking pink (cos she's a girl you see). Her Honda 2000 is also customised completely in pink, her pit crew are all dressed in slutty pink attire (I quite liked that), the cars interior is completely pink and even the exhaust flames when the car accelerates are pink...really? come on this has to be a Schumacher job.

So each driver is colour coordinated, one is all pink, one is all gold, one is all red but Walker lets the side down in his t-shirt and jeans. Everything about this film is all about street cred and bling, its god awful. The people in the street racing scenes consist of skimpily clad females (more so than the first film!) and bros with afros in baggy pants, it really is a complete stereotypical nightmare...in neon.

The plot seems to be exactly the same as the first film too, Walker must again go undercover and infiltrate a drug dealers setup to bring him down. This time he isn't a cop but he still thinks he's Keanu Reeves and his speech pattern has become wildly street wise, lots of 'bros' and 'cus' with lots of hip hop handshakes.

The problem with this film aside from the horrendous visuals and acting is the fact its pointless. There aren't really any street racing sequences bar one, even that is stupid because the film gives the impression a Mitsubishi EVO would struggle against a Camaro. Look US muscle cars can't beat Jap super saloons people!! US cars are bricks with V8/6 engines that go nowhere. There aren't really any outstanding stunts and what there is is CGI or greenscreen enhanced, and that includes the small racing sequences. Also the chase sequence at the finale is hilarious because its very clear the cars are all travelling very slowly. I know they can't really go at 120MPH+ the whole time but its so obvious! crawling along the highway with a bunch of cop cars right on there bumper lol! yeah right that's thrilling.

The finale is dull, the characters are dreadful, its chock full of hip hop tracks...in short its an absolute babyish mess that appears to be catering for one specific audience...oh did I mention its all in neon. The Miami setting is perfect for this camp looking mess in all honesty, I've never seen so much brightly coloured crap, and I hate how Walkers Skyline is full of blue neon ugh. Its a crime what they have done to some of those cars, hideous. Just label this under Grand Theft Auto: Bling Heist.

5.0,A Good Sequel,"The second film in the Fast and Furious series is, by all accounts, a much better movie than its predecessor. It's still exceptionally juvenile, but that is less prevalent due to a more solid story, a lot better pacing, and a much better companion character than Dom.Picking up where the last film left out, Brian O'Conner is on the run after casting aside his badge. In order to get by, he travels America doing street races for cash. When he gets to Miami, everything goes south when he's caught by police and dragged into an investigation. Forced to go undercover to get evidence against the head of a cartel, O'Conner brings in a friend from his childhood to help him race his way into the bad guys good graces.The plot is kind of the same as the previous film, but as I said, it's a lot more solid. There's not a lot of doing nothing and going nowhere as in the first film. This one fires on all cylinders and doesn't let up till the end. The pacing is light years beyond where it was before, with enough racing and good action sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat, while still carrying a (lackluster though it is) plot.And the action is where this movie shines. The first movie's focus on drag racing wasÂ…well, a drag. Drag races aren't exciting to watch. This film is a little about drifting, though a lot more about street racing. These scenes are much better directed and more engaging than anything from the first movie, with an actual sense of speed being created.Paul Walker is still as boring and generic as characters come, but Roman Pearce (played by Tyrese) is both hilarious and pretty memorable in the long run. He pretty much makes the movie.It's not a great movie, nor is it technically a good movie, but 2 Fast is a fun movie. It's full of dumb moments and stupid dialog but it seems like the series understands that awesome cars, hot chicks, and ridiculous action can compound to create the kind of escapist experience that most guys, the demographic this is aimed at, tend to enjoy.There's hope for future movies in the series yet!",sn319,2014-12-06,2014
4.0,Offensively brainless at times,"With Vin Diesel establishing himself as a star following roles in the excellent Pitch Black (2000) and the first The Fast and the Furious (2001) movie, Diesel chose not to star in 2 Fast 2 Furious, a sequel that amps up the action and car-porn but notably lacks the charisma and easy-going goofiness that made the first entry such an easy watch. Diesel bailed to make that hugely-memorable action film A Man Apart (anyone?), and is replaced by Tyrese Gibson, who certainly has the energy but lacks the star quality of the man whose void he is charged with filling. The amusingly-titled 2 Fast 2 Furious has no brains at all, and barely enough balls or originality to back it up.After allowing wanted criminal Dominic Toretto (Diesel) to evade capture at the climax of the first film, Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) has been discharged from the L.A.P.D. and finds himself on the run. With no income, he pays his way by participating in high- speed drag races, organised and refereed by Tej (Ludacris). After winning a race and fleeing the scene with the arrival of the cops, Brian is captured when his car is disabled by a ESD grappling hook. His former boss, FBI agent Bilkins (Thom Barry) throws him an offer - if he assists with a joint FBI-Customs sting to bring down violent drug-lord Carter Verone (Cole Hauser), his record will be wiped clean. Brian accepts on one condition - he chooses his own partner. Enter old friend and ex-jailbird Roman Pearce (Gibson).For fans of the franchise, the first sequel in a series that has now reached seven offers everything you would expect - bromance, pimped- out auto-mobiles, mild violence, and Eva Mendes in a white bikini. What it doesn't offer is a plot, credibility or anything remotely resembling a decent script. Walker, who commands top bill for a second time, is perfectly likable but lacks charisma or star quality. He and Gibson share a little chemistry, but they say little to each other apart from calling each other 'brah' a lot and talking to each other in their separate cars when they cannot hear each other. Hauser is unconvincing as a Colombian drug lord and his character is wafer-thin, and the way he goes about his business borders on the plain stupid. Hardly a trial to watch, but is offensively brainless at times.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",tomgillespie2002,2014-12-28,2014
7.0,The Engines Are Running Full Gear Here,"Without the assistance of a fugitive on the run Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel, who is AWOL here), Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) who's still a marked man with the FBI leaves Los Angeles and travels around the USA to compete in drag races and making new friends along the way as well as a substantial amount of money. It wasn't before long that the cops found his car and now he has to travels by foot. Until a lady drops him off at a car lot and his money he purchases a blue car and paints it silver. O'Connor ventures off to Miami where he reunites with ex-con Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) as they join forces with the FBI to track down a shady dealer named Carter Verone (Cole Hauser), but only in exchange if they erase his criminal records. They are also joined by Secret Agent Monica Fuentes to bring this sleazy miscreant to justice.

Unlike a lot of sequels where they don't measure up to the first instalments ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" succeeds in equalling up to the first instalment to maybe even being better (even without Vin Diesel). This movie like the first film is loaded with all the usual formulaic by-the-numbers mixed bag of clichés like the token slimy gangster and his dim-witted gang of goons, corrupt cops, by-the-book FBI agent and his determined sidekick and whatnot. But people who see this movie aren't here to see that. Hell no! We've come to see exciting drag races, cars crashing into each other, fight scenes, over-the-top humour (not Shakespaere), epic fights and most of all cool cars and hot girls.

With Vin Diesel out of the picture, Paul Walker takes the central role as Brian O'Connor an former LAPD on the run and locating himself in Miami to capture a sleazy dealer in exchange that for his criminal charges to be eradicated. And he turns in a wonderful performance, even though it just feels at time forced, but in a funny way. Why funny? Because he just seems a bit to old to be talking like the way he does. His dialogue makes him sound like an adolescent who's been living in the basement of an LA public school and has picked up on their lingo. Roman Pearce (Gibson) is O'Connor's sidekick is no Dominic Toretto is still a capable replacement and has just as much charisma to pull it off.

This movie is no different than the Land of Make Believe. It doesn't exist. It's all surreal. It's the threshold where the bad-assed dudes hang out, where drag racing is a pastime and not an illegality. Where the ladies let it loose and enjoy every moment of it. This utopia has our two heroes who constantly bicker like two teens arguing over who's pizza slice is bigger. In a world like this, there are no real good guys, and the badder you are, the greater your odds at survivor are in your favour. In action films this has been a common trend since Jason Statham starring in ""The Transporter"" as he played a hero who was a lackey for the underworld. These days, being a cookie-cutter hero is obsolete, it's a fight between bad guys and even more bad guys. O'Connor and Pearce confiscate drug money, but they take it before the cops grab their hands on the dough. It makes you wondering if the producers know who's coming to see this film or maybe not. It may feel at times like they're glorifying the audience watching it giving the impression those watching it are dumber than rocks.

But once the smoke is cleared the real stars are the awesome cars. They grind, they release steam and most of all, they make a lot of noise that it's not too late to purchase some earplugs. The opening drag race will likely have your heart beating faster than a thousand bees in a hive. Vin Diesel was not the only one who departed as Rob Cohen took an exodus as John Singleton took over the director's chair which is quite surprising since Singleton back in 1991 directed the ever so powerful drama ""Boyz in the Hood"". What happened? I guess under a more competent director should come to no fluke that this film is 5x better than the first instalment.

We know that the target audience was intended for the teen male audience between the ages of 15-20 years old. Their girlfriends knew what was coming to them when they joined them in this atmosphere and quite frankly, we never outgrow these kind of movies. Fast cars, exciting action and hot babes, what more do you need?",eric262003,2015-01-26,2015
8.0,2 Fast is 2 Cool,"The absence of Vin Diesel is felt greatly in this film, as he and Paul Walker were a great team in the original film. I wasn't sure if I would like this film the first time I saw it, but Paul Walker was still great, as was Tyrese Gibson, playing Roman.After this film, no one was certain about the future of the Fast franchise, not even Vin Diesel. There is a great storyline from this film that gives background on Brian O'Connor and Roman Pearce for future installments. This all culminates in the 2009 film, Fast & Furious.I have to say, I really liked the jump onto Carter Verone's (Cole Hauser) yacht, that was really spectacular. I wonder how many takes it took to get that right. And the ejection seats in the car! Ouch! Overall, 2 Fast was not the best of the series, but it was really good nonetheless.",Hollywood_Yoda,2015-02-07,2015
6.0,Vin Diesel Is Missed,"It was inevitable that following the success of a ""Fast And The Furious"" that a sequel would follow. It was also inevitable that the sequel would be of inferior quality. Plot In A Paragraph: Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) teams up with his ex-con friend Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) and works with undercover U.S. Customs Service agent Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) to bring Miami-based drug lord Carter Verone (Cole Hauser) down.In an early review for the first movie, I said I found this movie OK. I'm now embarrassed by that stupid statement.Vin Diesel elected not to return and he is a big miss. His replacement Tyrese Gibson is your token black guy with a chip on his shoulder, who spends the first sixty minutes of this ninety minute movie being a completely unlikeable douche who shows no respect to anyone, yet wants it from them. He is such an idiot he even tries stealing from the guy he is wanting a job of!! Yet the villain of the piece must be a moron as he still trusts him enough to hire him.Paul Walker tries hard, but is let down by a lame script, an absurd plot an annoying partner. Eva Mendes is incredibly attractive, and does well with what she can, in a typical role in these type of movies. I'm amazed a third movie was ever made due to the drop in quality here, but in sure it made a ton of money, and in Hollywood that is all that matters.",slightlymad22,2015-02-21,2015
6.0,fast but not too furious,"2 Fast 2 Furious is your typical sequel. The actions scenes and effects nearly double that of the original. We have a returning character - Brian O Conner (Paul Walker), with the rest of the cast composed of fresh faces that don't carry the same charm from the first film. Then there is the story, script and dialogue - all felt thrown together with the excuse to produce a sequel so we can get another chance at more tricked out rides and races. Unfortunately unlike its predecessor, all that leaves an impression in the end is the race action.The film begins right away with an explosive street race in Miami at night, which I found more enjoyable than the street race in the first F&F film. In fact, this is one of the best action scenes of the movie. At the finish line, cops arrive soon after and take in Brian, who is already wanted for helping Torretto escape in the first film. Brian's record can be wiped clean if he plays ball by going undercover and busting a big dealer in the area - Verone. Brian requests that his old pal ""Roman Pierce"" (Tyrese) accompany him to complete the deal. The pair go undercover, working for Verone, where another undercover (Eva Mendes) joins them. The whole Miami-drug dealer plot line felt too clichÃ©, so it added very little interest for me. Verone was very boring as the villain and his men are laughably bad and uninteresting. The script and dialogue only adds to the problem, making the film as a whole seem very juvenile and thrown together as compared to the first film.The races and cars are obviously the reason to watch this. The first street race is probably the best, but there are numerous other races and cop chases on the highways throughout the film too. The driving felt faster and more intense this time around. Unlike the first film, we do not nearly get to see into these vehicles as much and what makes them tick (except the gps units the cops installed to watch both Brian and Rome). The two cars that they are given to drive in are nice, but like the owners of the two muscle cars in the film say, kinda look like ""cracker jack toys"". They just didn't have as strong appeal as the rides in the first film either. The bonus this time around was the muscle cars. There are several race and chase scenes involving these beautiful machines. So if you are into American muscle, there is definitely more of that this time around.This is an OK sequel, pretty average as far as sequels go. If you loved the first for the cars and races, you should be satisfied with 2F2F. However, the rest of the movie doesn't carry much else to even the load.",Tyson14,2015-04-02,2015
7.0,Don't be '2 Fast 2 Furious' to Judge the Sequel,"Clearly many viewers were expecting 2 Fast 2 Furious to double up on the original. But without all the same cast members, it's hard to meet that level of expectation.

Brian is back in the racing scene and has earned his own street credit, with moves that are just as smooth as his first ride. However, it doesn't take long for the FBI to reel the ex-cop back into the law to help bring down a Miami drug exporter. Being a two-man job, Brian insists that Roman join the crew - a childhood friend and 'criminal' that wants to clear his record. What follows the reunion is a good film with action-packed car chases, sexy actors and great suspense.

Having watched all of the following Fast and Furious movies, it's important to have these two characters introduced early on. Most of you will agree with me saying, that the sequel is more laid back and doesn't take itself too seriously. I enjoyed the street racing, the narrative progression and amusing dialogue, particularly Roman's observations.

2 Fast 2 Furious is the kind of racing film you should see.",HubShotCameo,2015-04-05,2015
5.0,"Not the best Fast and Furious movie, but definitely not the worst...","Following the financial box office success of the first film, a sequel to The Fast and the Furious was announced for a summer June 2003 release and production would start quickly.The story picks up amazingly where the first film left off. After allowing fugitive Dominic Toretto to evade arrest, former LAPD officer Brian O'Conner finds himself on the run from the FBI and leaves Los Angeles to start a new life. He goes to Miami, where he wins races every night, but eventually is caught by the police. The police decides to let him go if he does one last mission to help bring Miami-based drug lord Carter Verone done with the help of his childhood friend Roman Pearce and undercover U.S. Custom Service agent Monica Fuentes as well as two other friends named Tej and Suki.I won't talk about this movie, saying that I had, but this is the one Fast and Furious film that critics took the wrong way.Story: The story is good, but it is not Oscar worthy and very cool and to bring a childhood friend into the story is just great.Music and editing: The music is cool by David Arnold, but I like the rap-oriented soundtrack and following Will Smith, Ludicrous, who is in the film, has four songs on the soundtrack including my personal favorite, ""Act a Fool"". I love that song and I like the video. The editing can get a little awkward but I also love what they do with this film. I just wish this film could have been longer.Action: There are car chases and the first car chase at the beginning of the film is FREAKING AWESOME! The first car chase involves four characters driving: Brian O'Conner, Suki, Orange Julius and Slap Jack, played by Michael Ealy, who does not have a lot of screen time, but is really good in this film and he would later play in other films including About Last Night, Think Like A Man 1 & 2 and Underworld: Awakening.Acting: The last thing I will bring up is the acting. Paul Walker returns as Brian O'Conner, without Vin Diesel, who was working on another film, xXx (2003) at the time. He plays the part brilliantly and his performance was his best. Ludicrous is a new addition as Tej and he brings a lot in with the screen time his character his. Devon Aoki as Suki, she also does a good job with the dialogue written for her, especially in the first car chase where she says, ""Bend over, boy."" The screen time she has is not a lot, but she pulls off one heck of a performance. I will bring up Eva Mendes as Monica Fuentes and she does a great job, but she's not in the film that much. Cole Hauser as Verone Carter is just dreadful, but he's also really good. The last person I will have to mention is Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pearce. He is just incredible, but the writers put way too much personality in his character, which I like and he and Ludicrous would later play in the later Fast and Furious films: Fast Five, which released in April of 2011, Fast & Furious, which released in 2013 during the summer movie season with other films including World War Z, Star Trek Into Darkness, The Wolverine, Frozen, Prisoners and other summer or fall movies of that year and Furious 7, the newest entry in the series which came out this year.Overall, I love and hate 2 Fast 2 Furious. While I like the story, music, editing, action and some of the acting, I can't stand Cole Hauser as Verone Carter. But I still think this is a watchable film.I give 2 Fast 2 Furious a 5.7 out of 10, not the best score, but definitely not the worst.",joshuadrake-39480,2015-04-24,2015
6.24,2 Long 2 Boring,"Except for Paul Walker, this was a terrible film. Poor Paul had to run around in this useless script and play opposite some very bad actors. Namely Eva Mendes who spends most of her time walking around with an attitude and too tight clothes. Is there anything else with her other than sticking her breasts in your face. Is this acting? Show your bosoms and get a gold star? I felt sorry for Paul Walker who had to work with this kind of crap. Thank Heavens he continued in the Fast & Furious series after this disaster.He will be missed. You can tell from his charisma on screen that he's a super nice guy and pleasure to know and work with.

6.0,Miami fast,"With the success of The Fast and the Furious which was essentially a remake of Point Break but with fast cars than surfers. 2 Fast 2 Furious returns with Paul Walker reprising his role as Brian O'Connor now a disgraced cop having let his prey get away in the first movie.Brian is contacted by the FBI in Miami who give him a chance of redemption as they want his help to get Carter Verone a ruthless drug exporter and they already have an undercover investigator assigned to him for some months, Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes.)Brian ropes in an old friend Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) to assist but he is unhappy at Brian, he never knew he was a cop and blames him for doing time inside. Tej (Ludacris) also pops up as a racing friend of Brian.John Singleton took up directing duties here which also had a new writing and producing team. Gone is Vin Diesel but we have the embryo of the franchise which starts here rather than the original film. More outrageous stunts, colourful cars, hot women, despicable bad guys, a diverse multi ethnic set of characters, more street music.The film has some silliness. I dare you to play a drinking game and stay sober every time Walker and Gibson give each other loving gazes. Yet its an entertaining film although just above average.",Prismark10,2015-06-16,2015
2.0,2 Dumb 2 Quickly.,"2 Fast 2 Furious (2003): Dir: John Singleton / Cast: Paul Walker, Tyrese Gibson, Eva Mendes, Cole Hauser, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges: Why John Singleton chose to direct this crap is beyond me. Sure, it is promising to see a director of his stature involved here but this isn't exactly Baby Boy. Unoriginal setup involves a drag race where Paul Walker is arrested. He was a cop in the first film but became a bit too involved with his target. Now he is ordered to transport illegal money to Miami but only with Tyrese Gibson as his partner. They expose symbolism in the title both being thinkers as well as furious with the injustice done to them. They do not trust the police and they realize the death warrant on their lives by the villains. This all follows formula and boils down to a mindless action climax. Walker is unfortunately flat but that shouldn't be a surprise since the first film sucked too. Gibson was Singleton's star in Baby Boy and he proved there that he is far above a Fast and the Furious sequel. He obviously stepped in when Vin Diesel had better things to do. Eva Mendes whose loyalty is questionable is featured but she is mainly an erotic tease. Cole Hauser plays the ever standard villain. Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges also makes an appearance but he is better off doing music. If you have seen the first pathetic film then it should come as no surprise that this film is every bit as bad. Score: 2 / 10",anaconda-40658,2015-06-24,2015
4.0,Slight improvement over the first,"
Again, I plunked down and watched the second film because I have bought a bluray-set of the first six movies. This time was more enjoyable.

Although, it is a major disappointment that Vin Diesel decided to bow out for the second installment, I think his replacement, Tyrese Gibson is okay. He was of course part of another big franchise (Transformers for the 2 people who may not have seen that trilogy) and here he seems to have a lot of fun. He was permitted to ad-lib a lot and fortunately his improv is for the most part hilarious.

Although, many have complained that the racing element is not a major part of this film, I think it is more the screenplay and the edit. I could have sworn that I saw at least two scenes that jump to another, where Tyrese and Paul Walker basically just repeat what the other one mentioned just before. Ex: At the end Tyrese says: I have to keep an eye on you here in Miami. The next scene Walker says: ""So your settling down here in Miami"".

The villain of the piece is a scary-looking feller. He looks like a cross between David Hasselhoff and Sgt. Barnes from platoon. Turns out he's the son of Wings Hauser, who did a lot of B-movies in the 80s and 90s. I think his largest role was in the mini-series adaptation of ""The Long Hot Summer"" with Don Johnson and Cybill Shepherd. One thing, though. It is sort of anticlimactic that we don't get to see him getting his head kicked in by either Walker or Tyrese. They did it to one of his henchmen in a hilarious fight scene.

Now, the director. This I had never thought in a million years but John Singleton of all people. It is like Woody Allen directing Lethal Weapon. Sadly, he does an admirable job most of the time except for the big action set-piece near the end.

Walker looks a bit tired of the whole thing and displays very little emotion throughout. It doesn't even look like a big deal to him that he loses the girl at the end.

So, if you are hell bent on seeing lots of cool races you are going to be disappointed but the show is a little bit easier to swallow, thanks in large part to Tyrese Gibson.",policy134,2015-07-04,2015
7.0,The cars are better than the first...,"The cars, the stunts and the eye candy (Eva Mendes) are better than the first. But unlike the first, 2 Fast 2 Furious still boasts a lacklustre plot. Nevertheless, it's a great ""bro"" movie for the guys. The partnership between Roman Pierce (Tyrese Gibson) and Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is amusing and works well as they team up and do next to impossible driving stunts with each other. The slight romance between Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) and Brian O'Connor is predictable, but it's not to the same extent as the first one - just a bit of flirtation but not to the extent of a full fledged relationship. The Miami backdrop adds to the ""upgrade"" feel of the second movie in the Fast & Furious franchise. Flashy and full of action is 2 Fast, 2 Furious.",hoxjennifer,2015-07-06,2015
10.0,"""2 Fast 2 Furious"" Lives Up to Its Title!","I love this movie, but honestly speaking, the title amuses me a bit. It looks a like an email/text message. Anyway, I guess it's a creative way to insert the ""2"" in the title. Haha! But anyway, this is a great sequel to its predecessor, even though I find it weird that Dominic (Vin Diesel) is absent in this movie.This film centers on Brian (Paul Walker) as he reunites with his childhood friend Roman (Tyrese Gibson) in their mission to take down a crime boss. Together they get help from Monica (Eva Mendes).The opening race is adrenaline-pumped and very exciting, but that's illegal, so no copycats, for God's sake, okay? I love the chemistry Brian and Roman develops. Before I forget, Roman is funny! He's the comic relief in this movie. Car sequences, which are the main selling points of this movie, are well-choreographed and beautifully executed. They may not happen in real life, but they're very great to watch.If this movie doesn't fall into a genre that you're looking for, then just get the hell outta here. If you're looking for action, some comedy, thrills, and pumps, congratulations! You're in the right place! Hop in!",AdrianOlonan,2015-07-17,2015
5.0,The series returns fast but maybe not as furious,"Rating-5/102 Fast 2 Furious is the sequel to ""The Fast and the Furious"" and see's ex cop Brian O'Connor make it into street racing, well kind of anyway. Dragged back in to the life he thought he'd given up, O'Connor faces many difficulties and many bad guys. All in all this movie is fairly basic viewing, flashy but not with the intelligence behind it to back it up, the kind of movie where everything is pretty OK rather than good.Paul Walker is O'Connor and the events of the last movie don't leave him, in fact mentions of Vin Diesel not being in the movie feature in seemingly every review of this film. It is true Vin Diesel is missed and the rest of the crew we got to know are too, but here we get a whole new set of people, just as sexy and crazy as before. As the acting goes the cast is OK nothing special here, Walker gives it not too much and ends up not really being good here but I did find the performance of Tyrese Gibson to be the best here, makes the movie more lively and even funnier at times.The plot is yet again of course set around street racing(what else) but this time it take a little different edge, it's still basic kind of racing movie stuff but does feel at least a bit different than the first. John Singleton directs and does a partly good job, same goes for the writing in truth and if both has been a little tighter this movie could have gone up a level, and really actually improved the series rather than take it down a notch.One part of the movie that is good are the stunts, the cars and of course the kind of wacky design so often associated with street racing. The cars do look good and some of the sequences involving them actually do improve upon the first film, even the effects look more clinical. I also liked the cinematography, fast moving but with well done shots, the whole technical side of this movie is probably the best thing this movie really has. Although what I just said may seem a little negative, the story is partially kind of engaging and many I can see will enjoy this, look past the kind of average plot lines and you could have a great time. Although again saying that this movie has very little emotion or power, can be exciting but can at a few moments waste it's promising character relationships and trade them in for more cars and more engines. The movie also doesn't feel so new, where as maybe the first movie could at least say it was slightly different, this has been seen before and doesn't offer much new things.At the time of writing this there have been many sequels to this and from what I saw here, I kind of can't see why they were made. Now I am not here to review the sequels, but from this evidence I would think watching this at the time that although it may gross well, people would get very bored with the same format over and over. The thing is people seem to love it and even though watching this movie a little time after it came out, the cars still seem fast and of course, furious.Overall would I recommend it, hell yes I would and for petrol heads then definitely. My review isn't what I would like to describe as negative, I think this movie is far from bad, it's just kind of so- so but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it and it's many races, real characters and even a few shoot-outs.",willcundallreview,2015-07-26,2015
6.24,A Mediocre Sequel At Best,"The second instalment in The Fast and the Furious franchise, 2 Fast 2 Furious continues the journey of Brian O'Conner and further expands the realms of this series by bringing in some new characters who replace the cast of the previous chapter and event though it stays true to its street racing roots, the whole experience is far too inferior to its predecessor.Following the events of the first film, 2 Fast 2 Furious follows Brian as he now finds himself being chased by the FBI and is eventually caught by the US Customs Service which offers him a clean slate in exchange for his assistance in bringing down a Miami-based drug lord. Agreeing to help, Brian enlists the help of his childhood friend to accomplish the mission.Directed by John Singleton, the problem with this sequel is that it's far too concerned with the street races & car chases rather than focusing on the main story at hand, which this time isn't even remotely compelling. In addition to that, the absence of Vin Diesel's Dominic Toretto also hurts its chances for his was the character who impressed the most in the last chapter.On an overall scale, 2 Fast 2 Furious is a step-down when compared to its predecessor but on looking back, it did add a few things to its universe that went on to play a vital role in the later chapters. Revelling in excess style, marred by lack of substance, weak antagonist & a few lazy attempts at humour, and held together only by Paul Walker's performance, 2 Fast 2 Furious is a mediocre sequel at best.",CinemaClown,2015-09-02,2015
6.0,A movie that tries too hard with not much action,"To be honest? The only part of this movie I ever really cared for was the first 15 minutes. The bridge jump sequence at night was really fun to watch. Can't say the same for the rest of the film.

There's one part of the movie, the main antagonist (I forgot his name already) puts a rat in someone's junk in an attempt to get information from him.

That whole rat baiting scene was just disgusting and (made me feel extremely uneasy) to watch.

The ending of the movie is a bit abrupt with a driving force of cars from a warehouse holding the police back so Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson can escape from the authorities. Okay.

A passable film. I only recommend you check it out if you are car collector or driving freak.",prestonwardcondra,2015-09-05,2015
7.0,"Not the best Fast and Furious movie, but definitely not the worst...","Following the financial box office success of the first film, a sequel to The Fast and the Furious was announced for a summer June 2003 release and production would start quickly.The story picks up amazingly where the first film left off. After allowing fugitive Dominic Toretto to evade arrest, former LAPD officer Brian O'Conner finds himself on the run from the FBI and leaves Los Angeles to start a new life. He goes to Miami, where he wins races every night, but eventually is caught by the police. The police decides to let him go if he does one last mission to help bring Miami-based drug lord Carter Verone done with the help of his childhood friend Roman Pearce and undercover U.S. Custom Service agent Monica Fuentes as well as two other friends named Tej and Suki.I won't talk about this movie, saying that I had, but this is the one Fast and Furious film that critics took the wrong way.Story: The story is good, but it is not Oscar worthy and very cool and to bring a childhood friend into the story is just great.Music and editing: The music is cool by David Arnold, but I like the rap-oriented soundtrack and following Will Smith, Ludicrous, who is in the film, has four songs on the soundtrack including my personal favorite, ""Act a Fool"". I love that song and I like the video. The editing can get a little awkward but I also love what they do with this film. I just wish this film could have been longer.Action: There are car chases and the first car chase at the beginning of the film is FREAKING AWESOME! The first car chase involves four characters driving: Brian O'Conner, Suki, Orange Julius and Slap Jack, played by Michael Ealy, who does not have a lot of screen time, but is really good in this film and he would later play in other films including About Last Night, Think Like A Man 1 & 2 and Underworld: Awakening.Acting: The last thing I will bring up is the acting. Paul Walker returns as Brian O'Conner, without Vin Diesel, who was working on another film, xXx (2003) at the time. He plays the part brilliantly and his performance was his best. Ludicrous is a new addition as Tej and he brings a lot in with the screen time his character his. Devon Aoki as Suki, she also does a good job with the dialogue written for her, especially in the first car chase where she says, ""Bend over, boy."" The screen time she has is not a lot, but she pulls off one heck of a performance. I will bring up Eva Mendes as Monica Fuentes and she does a great job, but she's not in the film that much. Cole Hauser as Verone Carter is just dreadful, but he's also really good. The last person I will have to mention is Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pearce. He is just incredible, but the writers put way too much personality in his character, which I like and he and Ludicrous would later play in the later Fast and Furious films: Fast Five, which released in April of 2011, Fast & Furious, which released in 2013 during the summer movie season with other films including World War Z, Star Trek Into Darkness, The Wolverine, Frozen, Prisoners and other summer or fall movies of that year and Furious 7, the newest entry in the series which came out this year.Overall, I love and hate 2 Fast 2 Furious. While I like the story, music, editing, action and some of the acting, I can't stand Cole Hauser as Verone Carter. But I still think this is a watchable film.I give 2 Fast 2 Furious a 7.4 out of 10, not the best score, but definitely not the worst.",joshuadrake-91275,2015-09-23,2015
10.0,Defending a very underrated Entertained solid action flick sequel,"2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) is highly underrated Entertained solid decent action flick for a sequel. I am a Paul Walker Fan and I just love him and his character Brian O'Conner former L.A. Police Officer. So I don't care what anyone says because absence without Vin Diesel was terrible. Well is not! Paul Walker plays all alone so he is awesome star. Leave this film alone it is pretty good and in my opinion is pretty much better than The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) and Furious Seven (2015). You have Tyrese Gibson, Chris Bridges, James Remar, Cole Hauser, Eva Mendes and Thom Barry as Agent Bilkins who reprise his role from the first installment in here. I love this film not as much as I love Fast & Furious 6 (2013), Fast Five (2011), The Fast & The Furious (2001) and Fast & Furious (2009). John Singleton did an excellent job directing this action packed sequel flick.""All right, let's see what this thing can do."" 'The adrenaline-fueled thrill ride that began with The Fast and the Furious takes an explosive new turn in 2 Fast 2 Furious! It's the nitro-fueled answer to the question: how fast do you like it? Now an ex-cop on the run, Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) hooks into outlaw street-racing. When the Feds strong-arm him back, O'Connor's no rules, win-or-die skills are unleashed against an international drug lord. With his velocity-addicted buddy (Tyrese Gibson) riding shotgun, and a drop-dead-gorgeous undercover agent (Eva Mendes) dialing up the heat, 2 Fast 2 Furious accelerates the action into a desperate race for survival, justice... and mind-blowing, jaw-dropping speed!'I love this movie and the racing damn good and i like Chris Bridges because he isn't like Ice Cube or others rappers that are actors talking like yo whats up dogg. Ludicrous talks proper English. I thought that the movie was incredible! The street racing scenes were very realistic and Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson are a perfect pair for the movie. 5 stars out of 5!! Tokyo Drift was not as good as 2 fast 2 furious, but still good. People: It's not that bad. In fact, it's really good. Is not a bad film it is actually a good film. I still can't believe why people criticized and bash this film so much. Gosh it is the last film in the series I like and I think is better than Tokyo Drift or Furious 7. Former cop Brian O'Conner is called upon to bust a dangerous criminal and he recruits the help of a former Miami street racer who has a chance to redeem himself. This film is set in Miami not in L.A. and Devon Aoki did a wonderful job as beautiful and sexy street racer Suki! Eva Mendes was gorgeous and sexy as Agent Monica Fuentes, she was so good at acting that even viewer is guessing if Monica is compromised and a dirty agent. Call it what you want I love this film and I think is the last good film of the franchise!Former Cop Brian O'Conner who teams up with his ex-con pal Roman Pearce to transport a shipment of 'dirty' money for shady Miami-based import-export dealer Carter Verone while actually working with undercover agent Monica Fuentes to bring Verone down. Brian O'Conner has left L.A. due to illegal actions from the first movie and now soars the streets of Miami taking money here and there by street racing. Watched by Customs Agent Monica Fuentes , Brian is caught by the police and is given a deal by agent Markham and Bilkins to go undercover and try to bring down drug lord Carter Verone in exchange for his criminal record to be erased. Brian agrees if he is given permission to choose his partner. Brian heads home to Barstow, California where he recruits an old friend Roman Pearce to help him. Pearce agrees but only for the same deal Brian was offered. With help Monica, Brian and Rome work together to take down Verone. This film was never about cars but it was about taking a crime lord down who is actually smuggling dirty laundry money with fast cars. Here we finally get to met Roman Pearce for the first time. We get to know more about Brian's background. We finally get to know why Brian let go Dom (Vin Diesel) in the first film. The Action sequences and fast cars are also great, so I don't know what is the problem at all?! 2 Fast 2 Furious is a 2003 American action film directed by John Singleton. It is the second installment of The Fast and the Furious franchise. Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) teams up with his ex-con friend Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) and works with undercover U.S. Customs Service agent Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) to bring Miami-based drug lord Carter Verone (Cole Hauser) down.The rating I am giving to this film is 7.

7.0,"Sit back, strap yourself in, and enjoy the NOS-injected popcorn!","2 Fast 2 Furious is the second film in the long running car-based action series (if you look very carefully, you'll see that the number '2' replaces the word 'Too' in the title! Clever that!). It's essentially the same cocktail of hot motors, hot girls, hot guys and hot locations as before, but with no Vin Diesel, his character having driven over the horizon at the end of the first film (only to return later in the series, once the actor had lowered his asking price).Instead, star Paul Walkerâ€”reprising his role as cop turned street-racer Brian O'Connorâ€”is teamed up with Tyrese Gibson, who plays Roman Pearce, a criminal given the chance to wipe his record clean if he helps the FBI bust crime boss Carter Verone (Cole Hauser). With help from lovely Latino undercover agent Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) and their super cool street-racer homies (who include rapper Ludicrous as garage owner Tej and model Devon Aoki as sexy driver Suki), Brian and Roman successfully outmanoeuvre the bad guys (and the feds) at every turn.Director John Singleton does a pretty good job handling the action, utilising all sorts of whizzy camera trickery and CGI effects to allow the camera to sweep from one driver to another during the high-speed racing scenes; it's technically impressive stuff that makes up somewhat for the extremely predictable plot and clichÃ©d characters. Some of the stunts are extremely sillyâ€”a jump over a raised bridge that sees Walker leap his vehicle over his opponent's car takes the biscuitâ€”but for a film that is all about excess, it all seems very apt and does little to spoil one's enjoyment.6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",BA_Harrison,2015-10-25,2015
6.0,Exciting Car Chases and Stunts Trump Tired Plot,"The talents of director John Singleton elevated the second entry in the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise a notch above its 2001 predecessor. In 2003's ""2 Fast 2 Furious,"" ex-cop Brian O'Conner returns to street racing and undercover police operations for Agent Bilkins, again played by Thom Barry. This time out, O'Conner pursues a drug trafficker, who wants to spirit his ill-gotten millions out of the country. However, the predictable well worn plot only serves as a linking device for some exciting high-speed car chases and daring stunts. The late Paul Walker again plays O'Conner, and, while a good-looking engaging actor, he is a bit All American white-bread for the part, which would be better served by a grittier tougher performer. Tyrese Gibson displays that needed grit and toughness as O'Conner's side-kick, Roman Pearce, an ex-con with street-smarts and driving skills. Eva Mendes as an undercover customs agent and Cole Hauser as Carter Verone, the drug king, also register well.However, ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" is not about performances, dialogue, or plot; the film is about exciting action, and, thanks to Singleton's direction and rapid-fire editing by Bruce Cannon and Dallas Puett, the movie delivers. Not to be misunderstood, the movie is no classic and not even much above fairly good. But if viewers want an exciting, easily forgettable flick that entertains, Singleton, Walker, and Gibson provide the goods here.",dglink,2015-10-30,2015
3.0,Meh...,"I absolutely hate this movie. It sucks so much. When I have Fast & Furious marathon, I skip this movie, along with Tokyo Drift. They are just two movies that are irrelevant, and did not need to be made. They aren't important, or entertaining. And no offense to the late Paul Walker (because he is awesome), but before Fast & Furious (number four), the character of Brian O'Conner wasn't that great. So, having a movie completely revolve around that character wasn't a great idea. They should've just had a Dominic Toretto movie. You could call it: Fast And Furious: Dom Edition. The only thing I remotely like about this movie, was the introduction to two characters that I really like, Roman Pearce, and Tej. This movie, along with Tokyo Drift, are definitely on the bottom end of the scale, especially compared to other Fast And Furious movies.

In this movie, Brian O'Conner, a former cop, is called to help bust a dangerous criminal. So in order to this, he recruits the help of a former Miami street racer.

Overall, I give this movie a 3 out of 10, which in my ratings book: Sucks.",taylorkingston,2015-11-24,2015
6.0,Just a bit 2 much 2 soon,"Being that there are a countless number of different vehicles, and the number of options to customize said vehicles are astronomically high and infinite, Rob Cohen's Fast and the Furious was only destined to spawn a sequel as cornily titled as 2 Fast 2 Furious. This time, the cars are slicker, the characters are slightly different, the ante is upped, and a new director helms the camera for a mostly satisfying second spin around the block.The film returns its focus on Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), the undercover police officer from the first film, who has now retired from the force in Miami, earning a living by streetracing. He meets a retired racer named Tej Parker (rapper Ludicrous), in addition to a car mechanic named Jimmy (Jin Auyeung), and a fellow street racer named Suki (Devon Aoki), and decides to live comfortably within his means, meaning dodging cops and entering high-profile races. While evading the police after one particular street race, Brian is apprehended by U.S. Customs Service, which informs him that in order to wipe this case, along with many others, off his record, he'd have to join an FBI mission to bring down a drug lord named Carter Verone (Cole Hauser).After hesitantly accepting the deal, being that Dom is now on the run from the law after being set free by Brian, Brian enlists in the help of Roman Pierce (Tyrese Gibson), a childhood friend and ex-convict with a love for cars almost matching his own. The two work with an undercover Customs agent named Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) in order to help bring down Verone.Unlike The Fast and the Furious, which was mostly concerned with replicating the kind of adrenaline and energy rush one experiences from street racing in a way that emphasized male bonding and the love for being alive, 2 Fast 2 Furious focuses more on the theatricalities of the racing experience. Car races and hot pursuits in this film have a glitzy aesthetic to them; a dose of what seems to be science-fiction moreso than any kind of realism, as in the first film. This is a film that's also more concerned with trying to find the perfect one-liner for the characters rather than emphasizing the relationship between the lead characters, which, between Walker and Vin Diesel in the original film, was built on a brotherly trust.Gibson has the energy and charisma as a performer, but writers Michael Brandt and Derek Haas don't give him the same kind of nonchalant aura or conversational grace Diesel had, which helped elevate the first film. Walker is still here doing the best acting job he can, given the very limited role his character has outside of being a cool presence, but Gibson's characterization is too flat and cheeky to uphold what Diesel did in the first film.The film was directed by John Singleton, who during this time, was reemphasizing to the same American audiences who didn't pay to see Rosewood or Baby Boy (also starring Gibson) in theaters that he is a multi-talented directing presence that deserves your consideration. Singelton's direction, which favors a lot of in-car shots during racing but doesn't skimp on exterior details, proves that The Fast and the Furious, while largely inspired as a concept and a franchise by the 1955 B-movie, isn't by any means a cheap exploitation film involving four wheels and muscle. It's a glossy, thoroughly Hollywood incarnation of the now-forgotten testament to breaking all written and unwritten rules of the road.2 Fast 2 Furious is sweet and harmless, and once again, not an assault on the senses in terms of being a sensory overload of chaos. It rekindles the charm of the bromance between its two leads, all while showcasing some nicely choreographed race scenes (particular Paul Walker's 'drive and stare' sequence, in addition to the couple of times he tries to handle his car backwards), and relies on its incorruptible energy to get by. The result may be a bit too much too soon in terms of theatrics, but most fans will likely see it as an incorporation in the series that was almost too little too late.Starring: Paul Walker, Tyrese Gibson, Eva Mendes, Cole Hauser, Ludicrous, Jin Auyueng, and Devon Aoki. Directed by: John Singleton.",StevePulaski,2015-12-09,2015
7.0,Enjoyable brain-in-neutral action,"Following the events of the previous film protagonist Brian O'Conner has been kicked out of the LAPD and is wanted for helping his friend evade the law. He has moved to Miami where he is part of the illegal street racing scene. After one race he is arrested and given a choice; be sent to jail or work with the federal authorities to help in an operation to catch Carter Verone; an Argentinian drug dealer. He agrees to help on condition that he gets to pick the partner to work with him. This partner is Roman Pearce, a convicted criminal who blames Brian for the fact that he spent three years in prison! Undercover agent Monica Fuentes manages to get them close to Verone but they will have prove themselves before getting the job of driving his ill-gotten cash to a point where he can get it out of the country. Inevitably they get the job but it won't be easy; Verone plans to kill them once they have served their purpose and the Miami PD are keen to stop them getting to their destination.

Technically speaking this film is not as good as the first; the story is more basic and it lacks Vin Diesel's character yet despite that I enjoyed it more. There are a succession of car chases and thrilling stunts; these are a lot of fun even though we know that there is no chance that Brian and Roman won't come out on top. We also have to ignore some obvious plot holes; most notably why would Verone want a couple of street racers in souped-up cars to transport his money when could get his own people to move it in an ordinary vehicle at sensible speeds without attracting attention of course that would make for a less thrilling film! The cast do a decent enough job; Paul Walker reprises the role of Brian and is a likable lead and Tyrese Gibson is fun as Roman the two have a pretty good chemistry. The rest of the cast are okay; Eva Mendes is solid enough as undercover agent Monica Fuentes although I can't help feeling that she, along with the other women in the film were there for their looks rather than anything else. Overall this is a fun brain in neutral film with lots of exciting action and impressive stunts.",Tweekums,2015-12-10,2015
6.0,Get revved up for a bit of car porn.,"The second instalment of what will become an on going film franchise, 2 Fast 2 Furious ticks all the boxes of the action junkie fan. Paul Walker is back as Brian O'Conner and joined by Tyrese Gibson and Eva Mendes, who all get involved in an undercover job to bring down Cole Hauser's nefarious bad guy. There's lots of awesome cars, pecs and breasts, noise, carnage, violence and awful dialogue. The story is weak, but are we really looking for some brains over brawn here? We want car porn and we want it now! And so it delivers as per our polite request. John Singleton directs, David Arnold scores the music and Matthew F. Leonetti photographs the sumptuous Florida locations. 6/10",hitchcockthelegend,2016-01-03,2016
8.0,Miss you Brian!,"2 fast 2 furious is a very entertaining movie to watch. It's a great film to enjoy maybe on a Friday or a Saturday night. What I like to call a great weekend movie. I absolutely adore Paul Walker in the Fast and Furious franchise, and i love him in this one too! When i see him on the screen, i just feel happy and i am totally encapsulated by his performance every time! He once again nails his portrayal of Brian O'connor. And it's just him, but also the whole rest of the cast does a good job here as well. The street racing scenes are so much fun, and the don't waste any time believe me, they just jump right into the street racing in the very first scene of the film. The plot of the movie is well constructed, much like the script and the dialouge between the characters. Overall, this movie is just a flat out good time for all viewers! 8/10.

5.0,Just read the review.,"This movie did a good job as a continuation of the story established in ""Fast and the Furious."" It kept the action one would expect in the story while also trying to make the story fairly interesting. My biggest complaint of this film that it was very repetitive plot-wise of the first film. Brian had to go undercover for the authorities to investigate a criminal through drag racing. Though the plot is still general enough to be able to do multiple stories within said plot. This story takes place in Miami which led to a much different tone than the first one which took place in LA. Tyrese Gibson was a fresh and I feel improved contrast to the sort of best friend role that Vin Diesel had played in the previous film. Overall a good action film that isn't too short and isn't too long.",ThatNerdInTheater,2016-04-20,2016
8.0,Better than Tokyo drift,"I think this movie is better than Tokyo drift and i'm going to tell you why. So in Tokyo there is no one from the original crew but in this one there is Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson that plays a big role in the sequels.Paul Walker really is the core of this movie and he has a great chemistry with Tyrese.Mendes is fine.She's just the hot chick and she does that well. The action is very enjoyable and well directed i gotta say.Some scenes actually have tension and suspense and that's very good in this kind of movie. In Tokyo there are very little epic sidepiece.In here there is also not much of epic loud sidepiece but there is more than in Tokyo and they are epic when they happen. One of the downsides to this movie is that it feels like a long music video in some scenes.They say bro way too much and it's kinda laughable at times. The villain is also not anything special.He is just a guy that gives commands and really doesn't do much till the end of the movie. The cars are mostly all import and it fits the tone of the movie,which is enjoyable,fun blockbuster. So this is why i think this movie is better than Tokyo drift.",rehor-masarova,2016-04-20,2016
6.0,Another of These Films,"Former cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) is called upon to bust a dangerous criminal and he recruits the help of a former childhood friend and street racer who has a chance to redeem himself.If you liked the first film, you will probably like the second. It is more of the same fluffy stuff -- fast, colorful cars, and women that are probably attractive to fans of professional wrestling. All in all, it is a terrible movie, but yet it exists.The best part is actually Mark Boone's rat scene. It's pretty terrifying and actually had me grimacing a bit. Not that this saves the movie, mind you. It is still full of goofy stuff, like the idea that a car going 120 can jump like 50 feet. You know, 120 is not actually that fast... the car would more likely just go nose down.",gavin6942,2016-08-26,2016
5.0,"Disappointing; this is a sequel, right?","2 Fast 2 Furious, the sequel to The Fast and The Furious, is disappointing in many regards. Personally it did not seem as enjoyable as the first film, due to an absence of main characters and a story that has little to do with the first film.The film does not pick up from the end of the previous film, rather following on from Turbo Charged Prelude, a short-film which hastily attempts to explain, in six minutes, how Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), the main character, has made his way from Los Angeles in the first film, to Miami by the second. The film itself features Brian and his childhood friend Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson), who have been given the special task of going undercover to bring down a crime organisation. This film shares very little in common with the first film, other than Brian himself, the name of the film, and sparse references to Dominic and his fleeing in the prior film. Perhaps it was the very absence of Dominic that had quite a bit to be considered; the first film leaves Brian and Dominic's relationship very much on a cliff-hanger, and those expecting to see expansion on their relationship in this film will be disappointed, as I was. Building up on the absence of Dominic is the very absence of just about every character from the first film. Generally, a sequel should continue the events of the first, however this does not happen in any regard in this film. However, when you push this aside, and ignore the fact that this is a sequel rather than a stand-alone, there are many positives. The clichÃ©d troubled-relationship between Brian and Roman is refreshing, which allows for some classic bad-boy antics. A new host of characters also make their way into this film, including Eva Mendes as Agent Monica Fuentes, Ludicrous as Tej Parker and Devon Aoki as Suki.Coal Hauser does a stunning job at playing the eccentric Carter Verone, a typical filthy-rich villain who is unpredictable, a man best to not mess with. However, James Remar does what I believe to be a poor job at playing Markham, the agent in charge of the operation to bring down Verone. Rather than be a man who is strict but doing what is right by his organisation, he instead comes across as an outright idiot. His lines are not only clearly scripted, but also poorly spoken, coming across as rash and downright rude. Whether or not this was intentional is not certain, but it certainly wasn't favourable. Stunts in the film are quite good (the boat scene, anyone?) however many seem to be randomly placed. Sure, a race at the start to introduce us to the movie is clever, but it only introduces supporting roles, unlike the first film in which its debut scene has Dominic and Brian racing. Not long into the film is a very mismatched scene which sees Roman and Brian going against two of Verone's men; these are two men that have hardly been characterised. However, I cannot say this scene was a failure; it really does have you on the edge of your seat into even the last seconds. There is a romance in this film, however it hardly lives up to that of the first film. The relationship between Monica and Brian remains at nothing but flirting. To be honest, I think the film would have been best without a romance; it's either a good romance, or none at all. Having not watched any of the other sequels yet, it seems quite a miracle to me that Universal have created a franchise of to-be 10 films. The 1st was good enough for a sequel (although just one, not the eventual nine), yet the 2nd fails to meet this criteria, and it is remarkable that eight sequels have now either been made or are in production. Therefore I am under the presumption that the next few films must be quite outstanding. On its own, this is a film that is entertaining enough, with stunts and a decent storyline that will keep audiences happy. However, as a sequel that hardly continues the first film, and does not live up to the reputation of the Fast and Furious series, this film is without a doubt a disappointment.",Tkbn3812,2016-09-22,2016
8.0,2 Good 2 Not Watch,"2 Fast 2 Furious was a pretty good installment in this franchise. Seeing that Brian was an original member of the cast from the very beginning. Old Blue Eyes is what I called him. I now see that he was the face of the franchise. I will be watching all of the rest of the installments to bring me back up to present day before they bring out the 8th installment. This 8th installment should be interesting to watch and to see who will be in it. Right now I'm watching Tokyo Drift. Last night I watched the the original The Fast and The Furious, I also watched 2 Fast 2 Furious(this one). It was really good .. I love the introduction of Roman Mr. Pierce into the franchise, he brought some comedy relief to the line up. But now watching TD ... I can see where the indifference of the cast members may have come into play. Van Diesel wasn't in 2 but he came back in 3 this one TD and old blue eyes wasn't in TD ...hhhmmm where problems brewing way back when? Anyway let me finish watching this ... So I can do a review on this one. ENJOY",hersheedontplay,2016-11-25,2016
4.0,A Cop Movie With Car Racing,"Well, the second instalment of this seven (so far) movie series has us in Miami and our hero from the previous movie is no longer in the police force, having been kicked out (or simply ran away) after he let the bad guy disappear. However, while racing in Miami he is caught by the police (who have this wonderful little weapon that will disable cars by causing them to short-circuit) and blackmail into either infiltrating a drug cartel or go to gaol for all the crimes that he has committed. Oh, and if he does do this, and manages to survive as well, then he gets a clean slate (I'm not sure if that is possible but it does make a good movie, and also a realistic motivation).

In a way it was a little better than the first movie, but honestly not by much. Sure, they actually gave a couple of women speaking roles as opposed to simply flaunting their bodies in bikinis, but there was plenty of that as well. They also had some drag races, but that is not surprising considering that this is the whole purpose of the film. However the drag races were few and far between and simply seemed to be an addition to fluff out what is basically another cop movie. In fact the whole idea of infiltrating illegal street racing was only a side issue, but then again the only connection between this film and the first were the characters (or two of them at least).

In a way I am not really all that sure about this film. Okay, it was entertaining, but then again I have come to expect that of films – it certainly wasn't boring, or slow. However, the objectification of women sort of puts me off an awful lot, even if there are a couple of women playing speaking roles (there were some in the first film but if you blinked you would certainly miss it, and in a way with this film and the first the women with speaking roles are probably only there to balance out all of the machismo that seems to ooze out of this movie). While it is probably okay to simply sit down and waste some time watching, on the other hand it really isn't anything hugely fantastic.",The-Sarkologist,2016-12-02,2016
6.0,A Pretty Good Sequel,"After allowing a criminal named ""Dominic Toretto"" (Vin Diesel) to escape into Mexico the former cop for the LAPD by the name of ""Brian O'Conner"" (Paul Walker) has relocated to Miami and continues to use his skills in illegal street racing. As luck would have it though, the law eventually catches up to him and they make him an offer he can't refuse-either help the FBI and U. S. Customs nab a drug kingpin named ""Carter Verone"" (Cole Hauser) or face a multitude of charges and go to prison. Needless to say, he takes the first option but only if he can help a friend named ""Roman Pearce"" (Tyrese Gibson) who happens to be in a similar situation as himself. That granted, it then falls upon the two of them to ingratiate themselves with Carter and for that to happen they have a undercover police officer already within his tight-knit circle named ""Monica Fuentes"" (Eva Mendes) to help them out. However, there isn't much trust among any of the participants and the slightest mistake will get a lot of people killed. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that I thought this movie was just as good as its predecessor with plenty of high-octane action and a little suspense thrown in for good measure as well. Admittedly, the stunt at the very end was extremely unrealistic, but all things considered, it didn't lower my overall satisfaction too much. That said, I have rated this movie accordingly. Slightly above average.",Uriah43,2017-01-09,2017
5.0,"No Vin, no problem. It's the Hollywood-ification that causes this sequel 2 slip","""The Fast and the Furious"" was only a decent movie with Vin Diesel. Then Universal opted to move forward on a quick-turnaround sequel without one half of the duo that kept that movie engaging. Surprisingly, this doesn't completely doom ""2 Fast 2 Furious,"" which struggles more with identity than it does trying to replace Diesel with Tyrese.""2 Fast"" moves the action to South Florida and opens with a neon-bedazzled street race that re-evokes the campy MTV Spring Break aesthetic of the last movie. O'Conner (Paul Walker) has been evading the law since he ""flipped,"" but he can't help get in the game when Tej (Ludicrous) calls him up. Unsurprisingly, the cops bust the party and it lands O'Conner in federal custody. Agents Markham (James Remar) and Bilkins (Thom Barry, from the first film) then give O'Conner an ultimatum: Help their undercover agent (Eva Mendes) take down Miami drug lord Carter Verone (Cole Hauser) or prison. When they say he needs a partner, he enlists the help of childhood buddy Roman Pierce (Tyrese) with whom he left things on bad terms.Understanding that being without Dominic Toretto would be a big blow, writers Michael Brandt and Derek Haas wisely attempt to substitute a co-star that could provide a similar dynamic. Roman ""Rome"" Pierce fills the hole of having O'Conner be at odds in a brotherly way with someone else. Tyrese steps up admirably, but the rest of the movie ends up painting them as more of a typical buddy-cop duo, with shades of comedy even. Brandt and Haas attempt to go full-scale Hollywood with ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" and while the inventiveness takes a healthy step forward, it comes at the cost of what made the first film a little more alternative to the typical blockbuster. ""The Fast and the Furious"" felt a little gritty and down to earth at times, whereas ""2 Fast"" is thinking about how to be bigger and bolder.Those risks pay off in positive ways when it comes to the entertainment value. A game of chicken in the middle of relay race infuses some energy into what would've been just another race sequence; the warehouse trick has a cool surprise effect; and the final stunt of the film needs no explanation. It's fun and director John Singleton (""Boyz in the Hood"") doesn't shy away from fun, even when it crosses the line to silly on many occasions.Yet the net effect of bigger stunts and sequences is not an improvement from the first film because of the way it sells out to a more traditional action movie formula. By the final act, it devolves into a spy movie with street-racing cars, which kind of reveals the entire film to be an attempt to make a ""James Bond"" movie with a ""street"" vibe. Even the villain is this rich guy who likes to torture people in gimmicky ways. Mendes is the Bond girl chained to said villain, but of course she's hopelessly attracted to O'Conner. Add all the ""bros"" and ""braes"" that O'Conner and Rome ceaselessly spew out, respectively, and it's not hard to see how Universal has taken a classic movie formula and dressed it up to reach an audience that would enjoy seeing Tyrese and Ludicrous in acting roles â€” or at least pay to see it. The first song used in the soundtrack actually has the phrase ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" in it. And you can't have rappers and R&B stars without surrounding them with busty women in bikinis to ogle.The digs come easy at ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" (the title, for one Â… ), but it manages to be creative and entertaining enough to counter its formulaic approach and desire to appeal to the basest of movie-watchers' instincts. It definitely understands what it is and how to maximize its appeal, even if we're wise to its ways.~Steven CThanks for reading!

7.0,a lot better then the 1st fast and the furious movie,I did not like The fast and the furious. I was surprised by how mush I like this movie. This movie has a great story line. It also has great acting. 5.9 is a good ratting. But this is such a great action movie. That 5.9 is underrating it. I give this movie a 7. Fast and the furious new model original parts is better. Fast five is also better. Fast and furious 6 is also better. Furious 7 is also better. But still this a great movie. One of the best action movies from 2003. See it. It is a great movie. It is a very good action movie. This is a lot better then 300. This movie is crap. This is a great movie.,jacobjohntaylor1,2017-04-05,2017
4.0,Doubles Down on Stupidity,"I'm as big of a fan of the Fast & Furious as anybody, but there's no question the low point of the series is the 2nd and 3rd film. 2 Fast 2 Furious is in large part just a complete rehash of the first film, but without the fun action and fun cheesy lines. The film attempts to do both of those, but fails miserably.Paul Walker is back as Brian O'Conner, the now former cop turned undercover agent, but instead of Dominic Toretto he's joined by Roman Pearce, played by Tyrese Gibson. Their chemistry is undeniable, but their acting? Yeah, it's not exactly Oscar caliber. Of course, I'm not expecting any of these movies to win academy awards, but I shouldn't cringe watching their acting for a good portion of the film. Eva Mendes also joins the cast this time, as a useless character that somewhat pines after O'Conner but is more or less just there as eye candy for the audience. Which pretty much describes the entire movie. It's nice to look at, but there's absolutely no point to this film.O'Conner & Pearce are hired by the FBI to infiltrate and take down criminal, Carter Verone, who plans to sell drugs and steal money, I think. We don't learn much about Verone, and he's pretty much your standard prototypical B-movie villain. Again, those adjectives can describe the overall quality of the film, standard and prototypical. Besides an occasional drag race or bland action sequence, I'm not sure what's really happening in this film. Why do we even care?It's the worst acted, written, and directed of the entire series, by far. When I go back and watch Tokyo Drift that could change, but I remember liking this film more the first time I watched it. Despite looking kind of neat, the action is sub-par. And that's the centerpiece of this franchise. If you're not already selling the film on acting or story, then you need something to keep my attention. Oh, and there's also this random torture scene that doesn't fit in at all with the rest of the film tonally. 2 Fast 2 Furious is borderline unwatchable.+Beautiful locations & cars-But that amounts to nothing film-wise-Poor acting, writing, and directing-Rehash of the first film4.0/10",ThomasDrufke,2017-04-07,2017
2.0,"This is the cheesy, twisted wreckage of carbon fiber","This is the cheesy, twisted wreckage of carbon fiber, bad acting, bikinis and awful acting that I imagine a lot of people think the first film is like.Brian O'Conner, GAP store mannequin Paul Walker, is now a former cop on the verge of arrest, but to avoid consequences he teams up with an old college friend, Tyrese Gibson, to help the police stop a drug dealer. ThisÂ… somehow involves car racing.So, unlike the first film, the childishly named 2 Fast 2 Furious (whoever came up with that deserves a punch to the stomach) removes any sense of worth and just goes straight for the ham and cheese. Tyrese Gibson's ""acting"" is totally overboard, he has to be high on something during filming, he's acting like a human Jar Jar Binks. Next to him is Paul Walker, the least interesting element of the first film.The plot isÂ… I don't even know. It bounces around between police business to shoved in car chases. At least The Fast and the Furious had a sense of community; a family unit that has racing at its heart, here, we get Walker and Gibson strutting into parties going ""Aw man, check this out, bro!"" at all the cars/car parts/girls in bikinis. Several times, and virtually shot-by-shot repeats! Utterly vapid screenplay. Plus, the sets and interior design work are horrendous! I know its set in Miami, but most of it is so gaudy with bright colours I swear I'm looking at some VIP section of McDonalds.But as we all know, surely the car action is the reason for being here? Well the film starts much like the first, only now we have the cardboard standee Walker pretending he's king of the hill, which is embarrassing. The girl drives the pink car, the boy drives the blue car, etc, making it feel like a game of Mario Kart (not to mention the CGI tinkered stunts). Later in the movie we have Tyrese doing his best to eat the scenery during car chases (and nobody here seems to realise that their racing opponents cannot hear their street trash talk during the raceÂ…) which definitely ruins any sense of excitement. The soundtrack is nowhere near as effective either.My brain was turned off so completely that I lost interest in what was happening. There was a freaky moment where the villain puts a rat in a bucket on a fat guy's stomach and proceeds to blowtorch the bucket though, that got my attention. Yeah, that was a thing.You want a good analogy of this film? This is the film equivalent of that moment when you are walking along the pavement, when suddenly a car flies past you and its driver shouts at you something like: ""FFFWwweeeerhghgh Aggfhh!!"" It is fast, you have no idea what possessed the person to do it, and it's instantly forgettable.",CinemaCocoa,2017-04-13,2017
4.0,Not 2 fast and not 2 furious,"The most glaring negative to ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" is it's incredible back pedaling on any sense of danger and excitement with a story that underwhelms to a huge degree. What before felt much more grand, here feels like a cheap 90s cop TV show. Almost everything that shined in the first film fails here.At the top of the list is the worthless and limp Cole Hauser as Miami's resident ""bad guy"" whose entire posse of henchmen appears to be two equally terrible Cuban drones. Why the writers would narrow this story to such an empty villain is beyond me. To top it off we have to deal with the FBI and the returning Thom Barry (Bilkins) who seriously doesn't even seem to show up for work. I kept wondering where he was looking when he was talking. Can we work on eye lines please?? Some seriously amateur acting there.As usual Eva Mendes thrills with her sexy, sultry appearance but falls flat with a vacuous almost non-existent performance. She has cornered the market on gorgeous yet empty actresses who excel in Hollywood. I think a career is modeling might do her much better. Just keep her mouth shut.Paul Walker, as the apparent protagonist to the series, fairs better but not much than anyone else. He looks good in the part as he did in the first film and carries himself well, especially in the driving scenes. Sadly and painfully though the writers and director somehow decided that the majority of the cast would speak ebonics/street in this film. Now, if it felt natural I would buy it, but when you force someone like Paul Walker into using phrases like ""cuz"" and ""kick it"" it comes off as incredibly fake and corny as if someone was trying to speak in a fake British Accent and could say nothing but ""Bloody Hell, Govna, I am bloody British"". SHUD UP !! Sorry, Paul Walker does not normally speak this way and his character Brian shouldn't either. I had a number of eye-roll moments dealing with Walker's onset of slang, cuz.On the positive side and one of the only things I did enjoy about the film was Tyrese Gibson as Roman. I think we got more of him than we did of his character. Every other word out of his mouth was ""bra"". It got annoying at times, but ultimately his performance came off as fun. At times I had some laugh out loud moments at his reactions and quips. The same type of stuff from Walker would have been hideous, but from Gibson it worked out fine.Going in to the film I knew it was directed by John Singleton who I have had great respect for in the past. ""Boyz n the Hood"" is a brilliant and powerful film. I also enjoyed ""Poetic Justice"" and ""Higher Learning"". I had a certain expectation about him as a Director that I thought would add to this series, but sadly it did not. Compared to the stylistic and impressive camera work and visual effects in the first film ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" really falls down a rung. The effects during the races/chases you would expect to improve but here seem much more ""low budget"" and animated. It almost at times seemed more like the over the top cartoon like antics of the Washowski's ""Speed Racer"" than another Fast and the Furious film. (Yes, I know this was before ""Speed Racer"", but I am simply drawing a comparison).There are fun smaller roles for Ludicrous (Tej) and the spicy little Devon Aoki (Suki) but they do not get much play here. Sadly, the local Miami racing circuit stuff at the beginning of the film was much more fun and interesting than the majority of the film with Cole Hauser and his dumb-ass sidekicks. I could even see a TV series around the antics of a team like this sans Paul Walker and all of his character's baggage. When Ludicrous is more fun and interesting than your main character you might want to do some damn re-writing.In the end, while there is promise here, I think the main plot / story is an un-interesting mess. It's just boring. Who cares. Keep the story more to the streets where it shines and away from FBI informants as hot as Eva Mendes. It's just dumb. While I respect John Singleton I do not think this was a good match for his skill set. Maybe the film was rushed, I don't know, but it is well below his capabilities in my opinion.",ryanskywalker-87402,2017-04-14,2017
4.0,A colorful but lower quality sequel,"Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) returns for another adventure of fast cars and undercover policing. Brian has gone on the run from the police in Miami beating other street racers in competitions hosted by Tej (Ludacris) when he is apprehended and forced to work with Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) if he wants to stay out of trouble. Unimpressed with the partner Agent Bilkins (Thom Barry) assigns to him, he suggests his old partner in crime Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) accompany him on the sting. The two racers are put into a fierce competition to impress the crime lord Carter Verone (Cole Hauser) and win his trust.

For what this sequel lacks in quality, it makes up for with color and new insane driving stunts as Brian swerves around in his lime green car going backward on the highway to beat the other criminals competing for the job. When the cops show up, Roman fires at them and Brian discovers that their cars have tracking devices on them. They make it back to Verone to win themselves a job, despite Roman's tendency to rub people the wrong way.

7.0,The Lack Of Diesel Fuel Doesn't Hurt This Movie Too Bad,"Sorry about that pun.First,the good,the villain,he is much better than the one from the first movie,he is slightly charming,but feels like a real killer.The action,it is well paced and executed,and very fun.There is a lot more races,but that's not a bad thing when cars are the heart of this franchise.The music is great,and there is a lot more humor mainly due to Tyrese Gibson,and other characters like Ludicrous.The characters in general,are good,they're very entertaining and are good replacements for the original cast.The best part is Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson's chemistry,seeing them get at each other's throats is just as fun as them having regular everyday conversations.Now,the bad,some of the dialogue feels very stupid and unrealistic,and sometimes the action outweighs the story.The worst part though,even though this movie was pretty good,the lack of Vin Diesel affects the movie a bit,as he was a great character and one of the best parts of the original,I also kind of missed the others.2 Fast 2 Furious is a really fun movie that feels slightly empty with the missing characters.",jordansepticeye,2017-04-17,2017
5.0,It's OK but a step-down from 1; Wouldn't Recommend,"Directed by John SingletonStarring Paul Walker, Tyrese Gibson and Eva Mendesâ€‹ Plot Overview: Set after the events of 'The Fast and the Furious', we see Brian O'Connor(Paul Walker), who has relocated to Miami to start over, get pulled back in by the FBI to stop a drug lord and hopefully wipe his record.General:Overall: I'm fine with shutting my brain off to enjoy a movie. Even after doing that, this movie is bland, dull, contains no interesting action or moments, and a severely uninteresting story. I will say that the overall tone has been improved and it doesn't feel depressing and sour like the original but aside from that there were no major strengths to the film. Some acting was fine but non of the characters stood out or were particularly memorable. That actually pretty sums up the majority of this movie well. Nothing was depressingly awful but by the same token nothing was remarkably impressive or good. Nothing stood out in the movie and nothing, except for the tone, felt like a genuine improvement or something that would benefit the series. So, to sum up, it was average.The types of people who will enjoy this movie will be fans of cars and maybe some fans of its predecessor. Wouldn't Recommend.Detailed:Paul Walker was fine as Brian O'Connor. Tyrese Gibson was alright as Roman Pierce but this role is no different to any role he plays and it doesn't distinguish him from... anything. Eva Mendes was here and that pretty much sums up her acting ability. Cole Hauser was very weak as Carter Verone. The villain was very weak and didn't have any interesting qualities.The story was very weak and the ending was very unsatisfying.The cinematography was fine. The race scenes were really poorly done.Both the set and costume design were fine. They weren't anything special and I don't think they put much effort in but it's clear there was SOME effort put in it. I will say that this film improved the overall tone of the movie and the inclusion of Roman Pierce was critical change. Aside from that, the action was weak and the set pieces were really, really, really bland. I know this was still technically before this became a franchise famous for set pieces but what we got here was even worse than the original.The music was alright.Personally, I don't enjoy this movie and feel like it was a step back in the overall franchise.5/10Wouldn't Recommend",EthanBJones_03,2017-04-24,2017
1.0,The second worst movie in the franchise,"The worst one is of course Tokyo Drift.

I love this franchise and I'm a big fan of the late Paul Walker.

And I know it introduces Rome and Tej and it's a setup for all the movies starting with number 4 with all the many added characters.

But lets face it: 2 Fast is retarded. Without Vin Diesel and Jordana Brewster, Walker's O' Conner (why is it spelled that stupid way??) is not working.

First of, why is Tej wearing that ridiculous afro wig in the opening scene?

Secondly: it's one thing that the many, many black, Asian and hispanic characters speak ebonics-English, but why do Brian speak it? He is an intelligent former cop, not a black rapper or a member of a black gang. It's like the also black director of the movie told him to speak Ebonics to blend in with the rest of the mostly black, Asian and hispanic cast. The result: Brian comes off as a dumb loser and doesn't seem like the Bran we liked in the first movie.

Thirdly: the many car chases are filled with horrible cgi.

Four: the villain played by the homeless mans Matthew McConaughey: Cole Hauser is not only pathetic but the one scene where he is suppose to be menacing, comes off as pointless, because of bad directing and censorship due to the PG13 rating.

Five: Yes I'm talking about the scene with the rat in the bucket in the nightclub. Hausers character clearly says the f-word in in the middle of a sentence the scene but it has been clumsily edited out so it comes of as weird and ruins the moment. The complete lack of emotion from Rome and especially Brian, watching a dirty cop being tortured, makes the scene boring.

Six: Eva Mendes as an undercover cop working for the badguy is not working. Shes not attractive, she's barely in the movie, has almost no lines. And her part is pretty much the damsel in distress. She is so insignifigant, that she could easily not have been in the movie and no one would notice it.

Seven: Brian and Rome both has a lot at stake here. Yet they both act like a couple of teenage boys that are too stupid to understand the trouble they're in. And that they can both face jail-time if they fail. Which makes this as movie without a single likable character in it.

And this movie fails on every level. From the ebonics to the retarded characters to the bad screenplay to the inept directing and acting.

Unless you're a 14 year old boy, that are happy with action-scenes and babes and nothing else going on in it, you will hate this movie.",tstudstrup,2017-07-13,2017

9.0,Review of 2Fast 2Furious,"**Warning, this review can spoil some content of the film.**

This is my first time ever a writing review and this one is about the movie ""2 Fast 2 Furious""

Fast and furious is an action movie, but F&F is more softer, because it has humorous scenes and I like this kind of genre. I'm a big fan of Fast and furious and I liked this movie very much, it was gripping. The F&F franchise has a lot of movies and for me this is one of the best of them.

In short, the plot of this film talks about an ex-cop, Brian O'Connor, who was arrested for drag racing and now has to work for FBI. He meets his old friend Roman and they infiltrated into cartel. There they had to get information about the cartel leader so that the police can arrest him. Things got tough and they had to stop the leader from escaping.

The acting was awesome. Paul Walker was young back then and got much energy. All the stunts were great. There were a lot of car chases, special effects. The cars were spectacular too, I loved those retro American cars. The movie has not so much violence, but it has a lot of villains against the good guys.

Overall, the film was superb and it is entertaining. It's definitely worth seeing and I recommend watching this, but from the beginning of the franchise, because then it's more understandable what's going on there.",villytammer,2017-12-02,2017

4.0,"Garish boy racer fantasy, a retreaded follow up","An American action film; A story about a former undercover policeman turned illegal road racer. This is the second installment in a series of eight films about road dacing.

But, with very little under the hood as story, the plot is overwrought, preposterous and full of holes, and mired by noisy set pieces.

Obviously Walkers wooden acting also Stretches out on his non existing skills of remembering names. The ending Scene included some car jump onto a boat, nearly killing loats of People. But Mr. Drug Lord just lets it happen and surrenders. Happy End. I dunno, this movie is so messed up. I can only imagine they had so much Money left from this massive product Placement so thats why the Franchise continues.",lythis-love,2019-04-18,2019
7.0,Missing the cast that makes the series what it is,"I only recently began to binge this entire franchise. I have been one of those people that scoffed at the success of this series and made fun of it even. The first three films are unique in that they are very much about street racing with a hint of action whereas the later films (4 and up) focus on action first. Still the second film holds it's own and Paul Walker carries the lead very well. The new additions to the cast are good and Tyrese Gibson is absolutely a high point and a welcome addition even when they bring him back. Cole Hauser is very good as the villain and Eva Mendes is alright as the undercover FBI agent. Her chemistry with Walker is very forced and not really ""there"" like it is with him and Jordana Brewster. What is missing is the unmistakable and unexplainable chemistry between Vin Diesel and Walker and the rest of the main cast that were in the original and come back later. The story is good, the characters are good and the racing is good but it's not great. It's not what the series becomes later on. But it's an important piece of this franchise. 7.5/10

6.0,Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson team-up to bring down a pompous drug lord in south Florida,"Now living in the Miami area and no longer an undercover cop, Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) is compelled by the authorities to work with a US Customs agent (Eva Mendes) to nail an arrogant drug lord (Cole Hauser). To accomplish this, he teams-up with an old street-racing buddy (Tyrese Gibson) who's in dire need of redemption.Paul Walker is the only notable cast member to return for ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" (2003). The others won't return until the fourth installment, ""Fast & Furious"" (2009). Anyway, I like the beginning of this sequel better than the first movie. Director John Singleton has a better eye for photographing women, at least as shown in the first 40 minutes or so; plus I appreciate the diverse cast, which also includes the likes of Ludacris as Tej, cutie Devon Aoki as Suki and James Remar as a lead agent.But as effective as Gibson is here, he can't rival the charisma of Vin Diesel. And somewhere just after the midpoint I started to get a little bored. Nevertheless, ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" is an entertaining race-oriented action thriller. It basically mixes the first movie (2001) with ""Licence to Kill"" (1989).The film runs 1 hour, 47 minutes and was shot in the Miami area.GRADE: B-",Wuchakk,2019-05-09,2019

7.0,2 fast 2 furious,"What made the first ""The Fast and the Furious"" movie attracted fans besides the bad ass cars and competition on the streets was Vin Diesel's appearance as Dominic Toretta, a hotshot race driver who makes his money racing others in the streets; he was a rising star on the fame after doing such flicks such as ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""The Iron Giant"" and later doing ""XXX"".At the end of the first movie, Vin's character Dominic flees away to Mexico where he wouldn't be in this sequel.No matter, the series continues on.""2 Fast 2 Furious"" has Paul Walker reprising his role as Brian O'Conner, the one time agent who betrayed the enforcement agency by letting Dominic get away, is now a fugitive and being in a race competitions every night to make money. After being captured by the police, Brian is given a choice in either going to jail or helped the people he once work for in taking down a drug cartel dealer (Cole Hauser). Brian agrees under one condition that he gets his childhood friend Roman Pierce (Tyrese Gibson, Transformers) involved since he's into cars and knows his ways around tough people. They're also given an ally, the sexy Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) who's not only an undercover agent but also posing as the enemy's mistress. Time will tell when all will be revealed.""2 Fast 2 Furious"" is directed by John Singleton of Boyz in the Hood fame where he manages to bring the same energy and high expectations of the first movie.

5.0,My Least Favorite Fast and Furious Film,"2 Fast 2 Furious I feel is a bit of a step down from the first movie, Fast and the Furious, which is saying something. Fast and the Furious was hardly a masterpiece, but it was a fun popcorn film that knew what it was, and what its target audience was. This film still has those fun popcorn elements, but without the star power. 2 Fast 2 Furious is one of the highest rated entries in the Fast franchise. I personally do not see why. Out of all the Fast films this movie is probably my least favorite.The characters this time around were quite non-engaging. The first film at least had Vin Diesel, who I am a fan of. You also had Michelle Rodriguez, despite not having a big role. Here Vin Diesel and Michelle are replaced with Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pierce, who I did not care for. Gibson came of as overly obnoxious and quite annoying. I know it is supposed to be part of his character, but I still found him annoying and not charming at all. You also have Chris Bridges playing a character named Tej, who I did not care for much either. Eva Mendes' character is also quite boring. She really does not do much, and is mostly there as a token love interest for Brian.Paul Walker returns as Brian O'Connor. Like the first film, I think he is alright, but he cannot really carry a film by himself. In the first film you have Vin Diesel as a secondary lead. Plus the supporting characters were more fun. Here all the characters minus Paul Walker were boring and irritating at times.The villain I will say, of all the villains in the Fast films, he is the most memorable, though that is not saying much. The Fast films have never had interesting villains, this one included. The villains just seem like an afterthought. They seem like just an excuse for cool car chases and races to happen. This film is no exception, though compared to the other films, I find this villain to be the strongest.The action and car chases are still cool and fun like the first movie. It seems like they were mostly practical. I did not notice much CGI which is a plus for the film.Overall, 2 Fast 2 Furious is a letdown sequel and the worst of the Fast films in my opinion. I do recommend watching this if you are interested in the following films. If you do not see this first you might be a bit confused.",mitchell5954,2019-08-17,2019

4.0,"""The rat symbolizes obviousness!""","Another film that I watched solely because of its position next on the alphabetical list of movies on Sky at the moment. I don't think I'd ever seen this one before though, which is odd as I've seen all the others in the series, even Tokyo Drift.Disgraced former cop and now infamous street Racer Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) is dragged back into the world of law enforcement after being asked to infiltrate the gang of drug kingpin Verone (Cole Hauser) with the lure of a full pardon dangled to entice him. Connor requests that his former friend and skilled driver Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) joins him and together they attempt to work through their issues, whilst bringing Verone to justice and saving Monica (Eva Mendes), another undercover agent, who may have switched sides.There are a few takeaways from watching this film now, most are about the future of the series but it's hard to start anywhere but with the passing of the film's star, Paul Walker. It's desperately sad that someone so young would have gone and a little odd at times to see him have accidents in the car, knowing that a real life one would ultimately cost him. It feels super harsh to pivot straight to thi and I'm sorry but it's the other thing that really struck me - he's awful in this film. Incapable of expressing any emotion, he smirks his way through the whole thing, tripping over lines and never convincing in his bond with Tyrese.Concerning the series, it's pretty strange to thing that we'd get from this relatively low rent story of bringing down a single Miami drug lord, to the gang literally saving the world. It is largely about illegal street racing still at this point and a rather tedious world of sitting on implausibly clean cars, idle threats and changing gears - OH MY GOD! the changing gears - there must be 50 shots of gear changes in the film. You'd think for a film so obsessed with cars, someone would know how to drive manual transmission properly.The stunts that are done practically all remain pretty good but the plot makes less sense, the more you think about it, and the film is festooned with bad performances, awful music and a pedestrian script.",southdavid,2020-01-02,2020
7.0,This is bananas.,"Ok, I get that the directing was very groundbreaking for the time, but I gotta say this:1) What 14 year old wrote the dialogue? It's like a Monster Energy Drink got sentience.2) Paul Walker couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. I'm sure he was a nice guy, but damn.3) Could they HAVE any more police cars in the Miami chase? They probably had more stunt cars for one chase than the actual Miami police.4) The scene where they have all the decoy cars come out of the garage, organized by their friends banding together? Really 10 would have been fine. Could have even done 6. Did it have to be like 200? They seriously cut away from the scene to a chase, and then cut back after 5 minutes, and there were STILL cars coming out of that garage? WHY? It's like that scene popped a leak!5) Who the hell wrote the storyline? Customs work with FBI to bring down drug lord....but somehow Customs are working against FBI and want to put the informants in jail? Then there's Miami cops somehow mixed in?It's somehow amazingly awful.I will totally watch this again. There's no choice but to watch for entertainment value.

2.0,2 Fast 2 Furious (2003),"Directed by John Singleton. Starring Paul Walker, Tyrese Gibson, Cole Hauser, Eva Mendes, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Thom Barry, James Remar, Mo Gallini, Roberto Sanchez, Devon Aoki, Mark Boone Junior, Jin Au-Yeung. (PG-13)Brain-dead sequel that no one asked for (at least, not like this) loses Vin Diesel but keeps Paul Walker, transports him to Miami to once again use his driving skills while working with law enforcement to take down a baddie (Hauser). He's aided by childhood pal Gibson--the Jar Jar Binks of the franchise--and the perpetually confused-looking Mendes playing an undercover Customs agent. A tired concept before it ever shifted out of park, haplessly delivered with amateurish razzle dazzle that has aged as well as lukewarm shrimp in a poorly-ventilated attic. It's sad to see how far a once supremely promising director has fallen--Singleton, the youngest director to ever score an Oscar nomination (for ""Boyz n the Hood""), can't bring any semblance of a pulse to the hollow enterprise. Even the racing and action scenes are boring this time out, and no one in the cast has the charisma to hold interest for thirty seconds, let alone the better part of two hours, especially Gibson, who's worse off constantly saying ""brah"" than he would be if every scene showed him wearing a bra. By far the worst entry in the series, but at least it vanishes from memory immediately, never to return again to slaughter more innocent brain cells.22/100 (what else?)",fntstcplnt,2020-02-05,2020

7.0,"Once again, surprisingly good","A sequel to the surprise hit The Fast and the Furious, 2 Fast 2 Furious (and isn't that just a heinous title for a movie) takes place sometime after the events of the original film. O'Conner (Paul Walker) has lost his job and is now on the run from the law. That is, until he gets pulled in to infiltrate yet another criminal organization with his street racing skills. This time he's joined by a childhood friend, played by Tyrese Gibson.I'm not sure if anyone expected from this film. Of course they made it after the first one became such a hit, but they made it on short notice, with a different director and without Vin Diesel or Michelle Rodriguez.Luckily though, the film manages to deliver. Sure, its plot is a bit more, shall we say, formulaic than its predecessor. But, it's still very cool, with fast cars, even faster dialogue, hot women and hot situations. It's a bit more sleek and stylized than the first one, but that's not a bad thing. Taking place in Miami instead of Los Angeles allows for that shift.I also really like the chemistry between Walker and Gibson. They bicker and argue constantly, exactly like childhood friends forced apart by misunderstandings and bad situations would do. Yet you never doubt their connection, their shared history. And that's simply good writing, as well as acting.Not a film that gets a lot of recognition from the fans of the franchise, which is a shame.

4.0,It just didn't do it for me...,"Here we go again! With the huge box office success of 'The Fast and the Furious', a sequel was inevitable. Along comes '2 Fast 2 Furious', or 'The Fast and the Furious 2', if you will.However, with the exception of Paul Walker, none of the original cast is back. Brian (Paul Walker) is no longer a cop, yet he finds himself once again working for the police. This time he - along with an ex-criminal friend, Roman (Tyrese Gibson) - has to investigate a wealthy criminal. Roman's back story is not very clear and this character also serves as the film's comic relief. The original film was far more serious and therefore more suspenseful; this film is very comedic and therefore I didn't take it as serious.If the premise itself is not cause for raising an eyebrow (or two!), then the execution thereof certainly will. Even Monica (Eva Mendes) was not a well defined character and I didn't always understand her. In fact, very little here was well explained or believable.At least the stunning cars are back, as well as incredible photography and amazing stunts. Unfortunately, it just didn't compensate for where the film lacked. '2 Fast 2 Furious' is much slower paced, with much less car action, and not as interesting a story. It also doesn't have as an impressive finale as the original. I'd much rather watch the original film again. I don't even think I'm going to remember '2 Fast 2 Furious'.

4.0,2 OK,"John Singleton, who directed Boyz n the Hood, stepped into the chair for the second film in the franchise, which loses Vin Diesel and keeps Paul Walker. This is how Roman Pearce (Tyrese) and Tej Parker (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) ended up becoming part of the movie family.

After letting Dominic, former LAPD officer Brian O'Conner (Walker) has left the West Coast behind, living in Miami as an illegal street racer. When the authorities grab him, he's forced into a deal where he'll help them stop Argentinian drug lord Carter Verone (Cole Hauser, yes, the son of Wings).



O'Conner has some help, as U.S. customs agent Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) has been undercover in Verone's organization for more than a year. He also reconnects with his childhood friend Roman, who blames him for getting arrested.

Taking a page out of the movies that have our true heart, James Remar appears as Agent Markham.

There are also plenty of other racers, like Suki (Devon Aoki, sister of Steve and daughter of Benihana founder Hirokai), who leads an all-girl race team, as well as people with names like Orange Julius and Slap Jack.

As for Diesel, well, he turned down $25 million to come back, instead starring in The Chronicles of Riddick. He's since stated that he wishes that he'd thought through this decison, but I think we can all agree that he's done just fine.

5.0,Best ever,"I'm as big of a lover of the Fast & Furious as anybody, but there is no question the low point of the series is that the 2nd and 3rd film. 2 Fast 2 Furious is in large part just an entire rehash of the primary film, but without the fun action and fun cheesy lines. The film attempts to try to to both of these , but fails miserably. Paul Walker is back as Brian O'Conner, the now former cop turned spy , but rather than Dominic Toretto he's joined by Roman Pearce, played by Tyrese Gibson. Their chemistry is undeniable, but their acting? Yeah, it isn't exactly Oscar caliber. Of course, I'm not expecting any of those movies to win academy awards, but I shouldn't cringe watching their acting for an honest portion of the film. Eva Mendes also joins the cast this point , as a useless character that somewhat pines after O'Conner but is more or less just there as visual percept for the audience. Which just about describes the whole movie. It's nice to seem at, but there's absolutely no point to the present film. O'Conner & Pearce are hired by the FBI to infiltrate and take down criminal, Carter Verone, who plans to sell drugs and steal money, I think. we do not learn much about Verone, and he's just about your standard prototypical B-movie villain. Again, those adjectives can describe the general quality of the film, standard and prototypical. Besides an occasional drag race or bland action sequence, I'm unsure what's really happening during this film. Why can we even care? it is the worst acted, written, and directed of the whole series, by far. once I return and watch Tokyo Drift that would change, but I remember liking this film more the primary time I watched it. Despite looking quite neat, the action is sub-par. and that is the centerpiece of this franchise. If you are not already selling the film on acting or story, then you would like something to stay my attention. Oh, and there is also this random torture scene that does not slot in in the least with the remainder of the film tonally. 2 Fast 2 Furious is borderline unwatchable. +Beautiful locations & cars -But that amounts to zilch film-wise -Poor acting, writing, and directing -Rehash of the primary film 4.0/10",moonhassan-67818,2020-09-16,2020
5.0,Incomprehensible action,"This review contains spoilers.

2 Fast and 2 Furious is the sequel to The Fast and the Furious. The movie stars Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner as he works with the FBI to clear his name after the events of the first movie. Brian partners with Roman Pearce, played by Tyrese Gibson as the two work to bring down a criminal drug lord.

Even more so in the sequel, the plot is an excuse to have car race and car chases. This plot absolutely requires the audience to turn off their brain in order to enjoy the action. The quiet scenes do not build on each other and the movie offers these as a weak excuse to have car chases and car races. Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto is missing in this movie. The movie suffers as a result of his absence. The missing pieces are picked up by Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson's chemistry on screen but not completely. These two characters and actors look like they are having a lot of fun on the screen. This translates to the movie well. However, this is not enough to hold up the quiet parts of the movie.

The action in this movie is good but it fails to have any story weight behind it. I am hard pressed to find any fulfilling action scenes in the movie.

2 Fast 2 Furious is not a good movie. It can be entertaining for its action, but audiences looking for a completely movie should look elsewhere.

9.0,Action Packed Film and one of the best.,"2 Fast, 2 Furious Review
Chad Budweiser2 Fast, 2 Furious was released in 2003 and is a fast paced, street racing/ crime action movie. It is the second installment of the Fast and Furious franchise. This movie is about Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and Roman Peirce (Tyrese Gibson) going undercover as criminals who are smuggling drugs.The overall plot is how Brian and Roman are trying to bring down the kingpin, Carter Verone. They have to win street races and act like criminals in order to gain Verone's trust. The special effects and dialogue is still very believable, however in the newer movies, it becomes far fetched as cars jump out of airplanes and across bridges. The scene where Brian flies over another car during the streetrace after going over a jump completely amazes me - even when I have seen the movie about a thousand times. The Movie is located in Miami and contains some mature subject matter, viewer discretion would be advised.The Film is directed by the late John Singleton. Singleton was known for his use of experience and personal beliefs of equality to be portrayed into his work. This was shown as three of the common characters were African-American, two were Latino, there were many Mexicans, while another two were asian.The camera work was also very well done. The angels did not remain in the same spot for too long and they didn't change up too quickly either. It was a perfect blend.Overall, this movie earns a 4.5/5.0 star rating from me. The only thing that retracts form its score is that if it was made ten or so years later, it would have a bigger budget and we would witness more expensive and luxurious vehicles.",ctalb-02749,2021-01-30,2021

8.0,A More Up Beat Sequel!,"Having got around to seeing the first film, comes me seeing this sequel! It's more upbeat & engaging than the first an expands on the underground racing universe!

The film follows Brian O'Connor teaming up with Roman Pierce, an ""old friends"" should we say who he put in prison 3 years prior & goes to him for help on a mission he's been assigned with in order to avoid charges related to street racing.

I found the film to be more interesting this time around, unlike the first, this one had more of a better colour pallet in terms of visuals (the Miami backdrop especially). The action is more in your face, the eye candy is emphasised & the story is more engaging & interesting!

The film at a run time of 1 hour & 36 minutes is decent & shows that the franchise is starting to expand & improve from here on out from a basic yet generic story line the first film had!

8/10.",vengeance20,2021-04-11,2021
5.0,A disappointing sequel!!!,"The beginning of the film is the best people!!! It has ludicrous and Paul walker plus this Asian chick racing then the cops bust them and the police use this electronic hook to kill the computers in Paul walkers car and that's just the first 20 minutes of the movie then he becomes a cop again., but first he recruits this guy that does car derby's but is on house arrest!! They make a deal with tryresse Gibson if he does the deal that he will get off of house arrest then the get fast cars and go undercover and then I sit bored at this sequel but the action is fast but very horrible it's mostly a action comedy movie more than a fast and the furious movie so skip this one!! Oh and the try to replace vin diesel with Tyreesse Gibbins a horrible choice!!!

This movie is a different case that leads down a much more epic road, I really enjoyed this movie, it had an amazing cast with creative story thT you feel engaged in.I was skeptical at first, purely based on the fact vin diesels wasn't present, but as I loved Paul walker I gave it a chance and it was amazing.A must watch for sure, highly recommend!",BrnzReviews,2021-05-25,2021

7.0,2 Fast 2 Furious,"This is a majorly underrated action sequel. There is no way it deserves a 5.9/10 (At the time of this review). I didn't really like how none of the original crew was in this movie besides Brian, but it all worked out. The street racing scene at the beginning was the best in the series, instead of doing the straight 1/4 mile, they raced across the streets of Miami. The plot of this movie was slightly better than the first movie, but the story wasn't. The first movie just had an all around better story with Brian being an undercover cop, Dom and the importance of family, this one involved Brian needing to go get a childhood friend to go undercover in a drug lord's crew. After already seeing the other movies, it was cool to see the introduction of Roman and Tej, they are so funny together.All in all, this is a good movie, and I recommend this to anyone who wants to watch it.",kaden_lewis,2021-07-02,2021

4.0,Pretty Rough,"2 Fast 2 Furious is a rough movie to get through. If it wasn't for the torture scene with the rat in the bucket, this film would probably be lower. I thought that it was comparatively brighter than the first film and had a lighter tone, but it was missing the heart. Roman Pearce adds some much needed comic relief, although his character won't really begin to grow until future installments.The pacing is all over the place, the love affair is seemingly pointless and the whole film just seems trashy. Move forward three films that this feels like its in a completely different franchise. Similar to the first film, I'm glad this movie was made but I don't care to go back and watch it again.",jace_the_film_guy,2021-07-16,2021
6.0,An average movie despite of superb act by Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson,"2 Fast 2 Furious is an action film directed by John Singleton and stars Late Paul Walker, Tyrese Gibson, Eva Mendes, Cole Hauser, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, and James Remar.This is the second installment of Fast and Furious series.The film can be called as a mix movie as the movie is entertaining and disappointing alike. The acting of the male leads is good but the plot and it's execution is too predictable, also apart from the two male lead most of the characters are not that effective.The plot of the movie is very predictable and as mentioned earlier the execution is also predictable, the screenplay of the movie is fast paced but as majorly the movie is predictable.Acting is majorly terrible and apart from Late Walker and Tyrese who both were impressive and effective. Cole Hauser was very much ineffective and forgettable in the villainous role.

The movie has several incongruities and inconsistencies in the story. The performances are not very good, neither are the chase scenes in cars, it has several scenes that are left over since they do not add anything to the plot.

9.0,An excellent movie with an unusual storyline,"A poorly written retelling of the first movie. But since they couldn't get Vin Diesel, Tyrese Gibson was the replacement. He and Walker have great chemistry and probably the most unintentional gay undertones I've seen in a movie. Once you notice them, it's very hard not to notice them, and that's probably the best comedic aspect of this movie, because the writers clearly didn't know how these lines would sound in context. And since some of them are spoken in the clips, it's even more hilarious. Otherwise, the plot is just another story of undercover brothers harassing a mob boss with a silly and unnecessary plan, where almost every plot point consists of races from one place to another. Some of the races are very interesting, such as Gibson and Walker beating the American cars in a team race. But that's the only thing that stands out. The overuse of CGI, which makes many scenes look like video games, and the silly, almost inappropriate, borderline Sci Fi car stunner only add to the film's redundancy. Nevertheless, the pacing and the aforementioned romance make this movie a little less enjoyable than the first film, but it's still a good ""ride.""",gemine-47875,2022-01-19,2022
3.0,All bark; no bite,"You know they went cheap in production when the editor was dumb enough to keep in a scene where the green screen video had a regulation street 4WD overtaking Brian and Roman with ease while they were supposed to be driving at top speed.

Some of the awkward choppy camera shots and whiplash inducing cuts remain, but there's plenty of impressive camera work in here too.What I really enjoyed about this film though was the general tone.

6.0,Mindless fun.,"Disgraced ex-police officer Brian O'Connor relocates from Los Angeles to Miami for a fresh start after failing to arrest Dominic Toretto. He makes a living by participating in illegal street races, befriending the likes of Tej (Ludacris) and Suki (Devon Aoki). He is thwarted after he gets arrested by the police. The FBI offer to erase Brian's criminal record if Brian can take down drug lord Carter Verone. (Cole Hauser) O'Connor takes the deal and convinces ex-friend Roman Pierce (Tyrese Gibson) to be his partner in exchange for the same deal Brian has with the FBI. They get some help from U. S Customs agent Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes), who is working undercover as an assistant for Carter Verone.

I love the first movie even if it's not a great film per se. It just has this charm about it that's impossible to resist. This sequel isn't nearly as good, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't enjoyable. I'm fully aware of how stupid it is, but it's a guilty pleasure of mine. I love entertaining cheese and this is simply great cheese. I think a lot of people (myself included at the time) were turned off by Vin Diesel's absence. Apparently, he didn't care for the script much and turned down a cool 25 million not to return for this sequel. Vin's presence is sorely missed here, but I enjoyed this movie far more than I did when it first came out. With my expectations now out of the way, I'm able to appreciate it for the mindless fun that it is. You've got really cool cars, beautiful women, fun car races, and plenty of great action to keep you entertained. A couple of good examples include the infamous stare and drive scene with Brian and Monica Fuentes. I loved how cheeky that was. Another example is near the end of the film where Brian and Roman use a ramp to launch their Camaro onto a yacht in a desperate attempt to rescue Monica and take down Carter Verone.

Paul Walker brings many of the same qualities that he had in the first movie. He's charming, affable and charismatic. He helped keep this movie afloat. Tyrese Gibson won't make anyone forget about Vin Diesel, but I liked him. He's annoying at times, but his innate charisma shines through. His antics had me grinning on more than one occasion. He also had good chemistry with Walker. Eva Mendes is gorgeous and does what she has to do well. I'd like to see her return to the franchise in the future. Cole Hauser is OK as the villain. He's technically fine and had the right amount of intensity, but I found him to be rather dull. Devon Aoki and James Remar stand out the most among the rest of the cast.

It is one of the worst movies in the series, I'm not gonna deny that. That said, I do think it's dumb fun overall and deserves to be treated as such. Just make sure you turn your brain off before viewing

5.0,2 Bland 2 Average,"Looking back at the franchise, John Singleton's 2 Fast 2 Furious might be the forgotten entry of the Fast & Furious series. It doesn't feature Vin Diesel or the rest of his 'family', except for Paul Walker's Brian O Connor, who once again goes undercover. For me, the fact that the film only brings back O Connor along with a brand new cast of characters is one of the film's strengths. Doing this manages to tell a new, separate story that doesn't have the trappings that come along with most sequels.The story follows ex-cop O Connor as he teams up with his ex-con friend, Roman Pearce, played by Tyrese Gibson, and an undercover agent played by Eva Mendes, as they take on Miami-based drug lord Carter Verone, played by Cole Hauser.Unfortunately, what they do with the story isn't particularly original or intriguing. The film has a pretty forgettable villain in Cole Hauser as the one-dimensional drug lord. Although he certainly is sinister, most memorably in a torture scene involving a rat and a blow torch, his character is quite bland. The film also introduces us to Tyrese Gibson's Roman Pearce, who would go on to become a series regular. I enjoyed his interplay with Walker here, as they brought a good cop and crook dynamic to the piece. Eva Mendes' character is severely underused, and her romance with Walker never felt remotely natural. And while Walker may not be the most versatile actor, he has extreme likability, which carries him as the leading man here.Singleton does a decent job with the film's action sequences. While there is a blend between practical and CGI, there is a physicality to the races and chases. And although it is certainly over the top, the action is still based in some sort of reality, unlike many of the subsequent sequels in this franchise.In the end, 2 Fast 2 Furious is a bit too average. While it's certainly not an awful movie, and there is a lot to enjoy here, it all feels a bit insubstantial. The film's best aspect is the self-contained story, and it's a shame they didn't have a better script.",Neill4797,2022-07-31,2022
9.0,"Racing again: brighter, faster, higher","The excellent film ""Fast and Furious"" starring Vin Diesel and Paul Walker was remembered for the quality work of the entire team. The sequel did not take long to wait. However, it so happened that only Paul Walker remained from the original cast. In this regard, a lot of new faces have joined the franchise, some of which still delight with their presence in this series of films.The charismatic Diesel was replaced by Tyrese Gibson's hero. The actor plays Roman Pierce. This is a completely different character, who does not even have to be compared with Dominic Toretto. Pierce looks very organic in the project, making up a quality duet with Walker.Other characters also look colorful. Despite almost a dozen new faces, the heroes are remembered to this day. For example, actor Cole Hauser showed himself well, who presented an antagonist with a piercing look named Carter Verona. Well, about the Hauser-actor is a separate conversation. The appearance of this man allows him to elegantly transform into villains, playing on the viewer with murderous eyes. This guy turned out to be right in the movie.Other heroes are also good. Ludacris, Eva Mendem, Devon Aoki, Matt Gallini, Roberto ""Sans"" Sanchez fit perfectly into the setting of hot Miami, where the races are organically wrapped up in the sultry pace of the city.About cars and the atmosphere - separately. ""Double Fast and Furious"" significantly increases everything that was in the first film. There is everything that avid fans of powerful cars and racing on dark streets need: pumped cars, loud modern music, lots of beautiful faces and figures, hangouts. And of course racing, racing, racing. In terms of watchability, this project looks somewhat better than the first film. The budget has doubled, which means that the scale of the project has grown. Another question is that races and chases, diverse plot moves are not as impressive as in the first story. This story has lost the masculinity that filled the first film with the hero of Vin Diesel. However, the film was filled with great colors and neon.Already the first race sets the tone for the picture, as if calling for understanding that the project will be an order of magnitude higher in technical terms. This pleases, but at the same time it is a little disappointing when subsequent events shift their focus from night street chases towards detective work and even spy games. However, I would not call this a blunder, rather a shift in emphasis. The project does not lose its watchability, constantly keeps in suspense, makes you empathize with the characters, and sometimes laugh heartily. After all, a kind of confrontation between the heroes of Gibson and Walker will have a lot of comical moments. The heroes are not friends in any way, they have little respect for each other, everyone has their own truth about the common past. And all this makes the joint stay on the screen of Brian O'Conner and Roman Pierce terribly interesting.The picture turned out to be good, even, probably, excellent. The film has everything that is so characteristic of the original ""Fast and Furious"". Viewers will enjoy not only an interesting story and confrontation with villains, but they will definitely feel the atmosphere of night street races, where engines roar, belching multicolored fire from exhaust pipes, and the streets live in order to drive the cherished tracks, necessarily ahead of rivals.9 out of 10.",alekspredator87,2022-11-09,2022

9.0,"2 Fast 2 Furious Is A Less Serious And More Fun Sequel Than The First One, And I Like It Even More Because Of That","2 Fast 2 Furious is a less serious and more fun sequel than the first one, and i like it even more because of that, also the bond and the chemistry between Brian and Roman is also more fun to watch compare to Brian more serious relationship with Dom which isn't mean any bad but of course i prefer the more fun stuff, and so do the rest of 2 Fast 2 Furious a solid well made sequel that are well acted by all the cast for the most part especially both Paul Walker and Tyrese creating an entertaining funny love-hate relationship throughout the movie, banger hip-hop soundtrack, cool special effects, and exciting action, 2 Fast 2 Furious is a pure fun ride, isn't perfect like the first one, i can feel this missingness feeling of Vin Diesel throughout the film, it also still have some nit picky here and there but less than the first one and that's also another reason why i still like 2 Fast 2 Furious more than the first, and i love it overall.",HabibieHakim123,2023-02-12,2023
8.0,Underrated and Underappreciated,"The plot is simplistic and plays into many stereotypes all the way up to Verone's two henchmen, however this movie will likely fulfill the needs of any thrill seeking adrenaline junky who appreciates car chase scenes. Some of the chases are quite exciting and differ slightly from the typical chase sequences.The absence of Vin Diesel certainly is disappointing after his solid chemistry with Paul Walker in the first, but Tyrese Gibson is also fantastic with Walker. There is some very good humour offered up that helps build the connection between the actors. Both characters show growth throughout the movie while still staying true to themselves.It's very much a movie you can sit back and just have a good time with and doesn't require you to put too much thought into it . Simple and yet effective. The negative reviews regarding this film are a surprise as it serves as an excellent sequel in the series in my view, particularly considering the absence of many of the first movies main characters. Perhaps some were bitter about this very fact, but it's still an enjoyable experience with the cast offered.",ThereelscoopwithKK,2023-02-15,2023
5.0,The Road To Fast X,"2Fast 2Furious was Released on June 6th 2003 let's be honest this was not a great movie the acting was awful the story and plot was bad the effects are dated
The CGI aged badly
The plot is nothing more of a rehash of the original some of the side characters are that interesting at all
Didn't Like the rat turtor scene that just took me right out the movie
The villian was so boring Eva Mendes was miscast and pretty much ruined the movie for me
The stunts were bad some of the action scenes were fine not that great

7.0,A Solid Sequel,"A solid and underrated sequel that brings us a lot of action and a bit of humor.In this sequel, Brian tries to convince an old friend to join him on a dangerous mission and get a chance to start over along the way.Paul Walker returns as Brian, joined by Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pearce. The two work perfectly together and bring freshness and humor to the story.The movie is fun and full of action scenes, and the supporting characters are hilarious.The evil gangster and his henchmen are fun, and Eva Mendes does a great job in her role. Cole Hauser is excellent in the role of a vicious criminal who stops at nothing to achieve his goals.The film is made to entertain the viewer and it certainly succeeds in that.The action is reminiscent of fun films from the 90s and 80s, and that alone is an indication that this film is worth watching.Solid entertainment that fits perfectly with the whole story.",dk777,2023-03-20,2023

3.0,NONSTOP THRILLING YET PREDICTABLE RIDE,"The chemistry between the protagonist and the sidekick was incredibly effective. Their tag team became the center attraction of the entire movie. The stunts and cinematography was good enough. Probably the biggest issue I had with this film was that the characters were mostly stale and mediocre. If it weren't for the exciting driving scenes, this would have been the worst movie of the entire franchise. It was unnecessarily long and too much unnecessary details. It did provide a great but brief background the characters, though. I guess I was just hoping that more interesting characters were present.",jeromesgabilo,2023-05-16,2023
7.0,Entertaining,"2 Fast 2 Furious hits the ground running and creates an entertaining storyline. The setting is new, the characters (except for Paul Walker) are new and there are new stakes to play for. A good refresh and change of scenery. If you love cars, action sequences and some over the top stunts then this film can land well. The main antagonist, Cole Hauser, makes for a great and dangerous character. He always has charisma and his unpredictable nature makes him fun to watch. The scenes at the end took the film to a new and exciting level with the numerous car decoys and helicopter chase.Surprised by the low rating on here, this definitely deserves a higher score. Not a badly put together film.",Kingslaay,2023-05-21,2023
6.0,Almost as entertaining as the first one! But not quite.,"This movie felt slightly different than the first one (slightly worse since it leaned even more into the crime-angled plot and not the action, plus no Vin Diesel which is sort of seen as a necessity to the franchise I take it). Although, I liked Tyrese Gibson quite a bit, this is one of the best movies I've seen him in so far besides 1 or 2 Michael Bay Tranformers movies. There was 1, 2, maybe 3 scenes stood out to me and at least the first one felt original. Admittedly this makes me not want to check out the 3rd one though as much as the 1st one motivated me to look into the 2nd. Not as inclined to watch again.",SPZMaxinema,2023-05-27,2023
6.0,Fun buddy Cop Movie yet something felt missing,"Review: The sequel to the 2001 movie was a fun movie, but it isn't really among the best in the series. Because of important characters from the first movie, that were absent here, It felt more like a spin-off than an actual sequel .

Takeaways -Paul walker is back as Brian O Conner. He is now longer a cop, having left the police force after deciding to not arrest Dom. He is now a full time street racer, and races amongst the likes of others. However Brian is arrested and the Police Captain promises to have his criminal record wiped clean if he participates in one last undercover assignment. Investigating a crime lord shipping drugs.

-Tyrese Gibson debuts in the fast series as Roman Pierce, Brian's close friend. This was before he got rich and did complaining in the sequels. Lol

-Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges also debuts as Street Racer Tej Parker. (He later became known for his computer skills in later films)

The action was great

Bryan's car and the other cars still look nice

-Conclusion-I don't know why but something felt off.... Oh I know what it is...Vin Diesel (Dom) isn't it!! That's why! Also Mia and Letty's absence was also felt. This really didn't feel like a sequel to me, but more of a spin-off.",myblueblazer,2023-05-29,2023
6.0,Fast and the Furious hits Miami but without Vin Diesel and the tight knit crew.,"This is the second installment in The Fast and The Furious franchise, it is a decent action adventure with cars and street racing...but doesn't have as good of a story as the first film, with Vin Diesel's character Dom noticeably missing. And while the first film is laden with testosterone, this Miami version flips over to misogyne and a blatant objectification of women as the screen is filled up time and time again with scantily clad women showing excessive amounts of skin and being manhandled by men. I'm sure there are men everywhere who love it, but as a woman it did nothing for me and may have actually detracted from the film.There are three spectacular stunts in this film that make it worth watching...car landing on a speed boat, ejector seats, and the mass street racer cop misdirection (which was so much fun).Lots of street racing...and cars, lots of cars (including some muscle cars) for car fanatics.Brian, the cop from the first film (still played by Paul Walker), is no longer a cop and is now living in Miami. He is approached by a joint task force of Customs and FBI Agent Bilkins (still played by Thom Barry) to help the customs undercover agent Monica Fuentes (played by new comer Eva Mendez) take down the dangerous criminal Carter Verone before he goes on the run. Carter Verone needs drivers and Brian asks to be paired with his childhood friend Roman Pearce. Roman hasn't forgiven Brian for being a cop! What's in it for Roman and Brian is a chance to expunge their records and have all charges against them dropped...or a chance to start fresh.Not as tight of a plot as the first film, lacking the camaraderie of the brotherhood that Dom and his crew offered, but still lots of fun and a worthwhile watch in the Fast and Furious franchise...even if it isn't the best film.",cgvsluis,2023-05-30,2023

4.0,One of the weaker films in the franchise,"This is the film where the character Roman Pearce was first introduced, and with additional opportunities later, he eventually solidified his place in this franchise, and rightfully so. He is the one and only comic relief; he makes you laugh and takes the pressure off the situation, which is something I tend to adore.Now returning to the sequel, it's strictly below average, except for Brian & Roman's bromance; there's nothing to take away. And the main reason for its incompetence is a weak antagonist. Carter Verone is one of, if not the, most uninteresting & uninspiring adversaries to appear in the franchise's history, which says a lot.",SoumikBanerjee1996,2023-06-09,2023
6.0,A thoroughly terrible movie that I had fun with,"This is not a good movie. But it is insanely fun. I think the best points of comparison would be Transformers Dark of the Moon or the Venom movies. Not good but very fun. 2 Fast 2 Furious has good action, fun car chases, cheesy acting, energetic direction, and an over the top climax. The opening scene of the movie is without exaggeration an almost 20 minute long race scene featuring three racial stereotypes and Paul Walker. I think the dynamic of Walker and Vin Diesel was more entertaining than the two leads of this movie, but they have good enough chemistry and they're pretty fun together. I didn't enjoy it as much as the first Fast and Furious, which I think is a legitimately good action movie, but it's a fun so bad it's good movie.",roaches_97,2023-06-18,2023
6.0,"""Bend over, boy.""","(703-word review) The first film was all fun and games. It never felt that serious. There was an antagonist, sure, along with the 'good guys vs. Bad guys' element, yet it was in an exciting, spectacle way. But here, this film upped the ante. It felt like there were actual stakes, not to mention the surprise of Carter Verone being a compelling villain, elevated immensely by Cole Hauser's performance. That torture scene was gnarly and may even be the ""furthest"" the franchise has gone in that way; I can't imagine other scenes at that level in the other films.

The story, too, in connection with that, was written more seriously than in the first one, which revolved around hijackers, topped with a villain with a grudge, who's there for appearances more than anything - and street racing being at the crux of it all, especially the villain; that aspect, while done (because it's one of the hearts of this franchise) was less so here.

For that, props are in order. The gradual development of the action-y excitement to greater heights is almost palpable enough to grab. Just look at the culmination of the final act with the boat. This film is only the second one; things like that are happening - doesn't it bring a tear to your eye? Probably in a negative way, huh? You can see all that implausibility and absurdity right on the horizon, getting closer. Awww, this franchise is already grown up. Isn't that adorable?

And during the culmination of that final act, Roman even did his now-shtick of freaking out and being the audience stand-in for laying out what's about to happen in a half-questioning, half-incredulous manner to pointing out the ridiculousness and raising the concerns of success at doing these spectacular deeds. Two films in, yes, but we're too deep in now - hook, line, and sinker, The ""battle"" has been won, by ""THEM,"" ladies and gentlemen. We can't escape; we can, however, go along with the ride every single time, won't we? Hell, yeah! It's all about family!

But, speaking of family, that's the elephant in the room. Dominic ""Family"" Toretto was busy with family, doing family activities with his family, and some more family dropped in from their family stations in space to join in on the family activities for the family. And that negatively impacted the film. He's needed; he and Brian, the duo of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker - needed. I assume the latter was more popular, and people weren't too bothered by Vin's absence. But come on. He's The Fast and the Furious, 2 Fast 2 Furious, and the Fast & Furious Saga. He's family.

On a more positive note, this served as our first exposure and introduction to Roman Pearce and Tej Parker, now cemented into this franchise's legacy; they're part of the family now, and when Dom finds out, there will be a Corona-only, family-only party of family-oriented festivities, and a bunch of family banter that only family members can achieve.

Another introduction was Suki; this being her only appearance in the franchise - hopefully, Devon Aoki will be back at some point (and you might as well throw Orange Julius and Slap Jack in there; why wouldn't you bring back Amaury Nolasco and Michael Ealy? Hell, do the same with Leon, and use the power of family to do the same with Jesse, and Vince, beyond whichever film he did return in; don't underestimate what the power of family can do).

And she (cultural icon!) unironically seems to be more iconic, with a more significant impact, franchise-wide, than the other supporting characters; Dominic Toretto can't be surpassed. Her dialogue was sublime, and so was some of Roman's but specifically Tyrese Gibson's overall performance; he outshined Paul Walker, the weakest link here and even in the first film.

Besides all of that, the cinematography by Matthew F. Leonetti was great. That stood out in the first installment, too. Something about that 2000s aesthetic and how films and TV shows looked works tremendously on the eyes. The soundtrack was also decent enough.

Missing a critical component - family - along with its grandmaster, Dominic Toretto, only so much was accomplished by Roman Pearce, Suki, the cinematography, and the villain.",LegendaryFang56,2023-06-26,2023
9.0,Typical action movie,"When someone tells you that they LOVE action movies... that's what you usually get in mind.

6.0,Not bad,"2 Fast 2 Furious offers a high-speed and adrenaline-filled option for action enthusiasts. Focusing on visual effects and car races, it successfully captivates viewers. The vibrant atmosphere of Miami enriches the film visually.However, there are shortcomings in terms of both the storyline and character development. The plot is riddled with some logical inconsistencies and mundane dialogues. The absence of Vin Diesel, who couldn't be replaced from the first film, makes it difficult for some viewers to establish the connection they seek. Superficial depictions replace in-depth character analyses.In conclusion, ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" might appeal to fans of action and speed, but it stands out as a production struggling to satisfy in terms of the story and characters.",uhudsavascisi,2023-08-18,2023
8.0,"Double the Speed, Double the Fun: 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)","""2 Fast 2 Furious"" takes the adrenaline-fueled excitement of its predecessor to a whole new level, delivering a turbocharged cinematic experience that's as exhilarating as it is entertaining. Directed by John Singleton, this sequel revs up the action, serving fans a heaping plate of high-speed chases, jaw-dropping stunts, and a healthy dose of camaraderie, making it a worthy addition to the franchise.From the moment the movie kicks into gear, it's clear that speed is the name of the game. The film's heart-pounding races are nothing short of spectacular, featuring sleek cars, daring maneuvers, and intense rivalries that keep you glued to the edge of your seat. The meticulously choreographed action sequences are a testament to the film's dedication to delivering pulse-pounding thrills, and they do not disappoint.While Vin Diesel may be missed, Paul Walker returns as Brian O'Conner, proving once again that he's the perfect leading man for this high-octane series. Walker's charisma and charm shine, and his chemistry with the new addition to the cast, Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pearce, injects the film with a healthy dose of humor and camaraderie. Their banter and camaraderie add depth to the characters, making the audience emotionally invested in their journey.The film's visuals are a feast for the eyes, capturing the vibrant energy of Miami with its neon-lit streets and sleek, fast cars. The cinematography is dynamic, capturing the speed and intensity of the races while also showcasing the beauty of the exotic locations. The editing is sharp and precise, ensuring that every action sequence is as visually stunning as it is thrilling.""2 Fast 2 Furious"" successfully maintains the essence of the original film while also carving its own path. It embraces the spirit of the street racing subculture, immersing viewers in a world of fast cars, fierce competition, and flashy lifestyles. The film doesn't just rely on its action sequences; it also explores themes of loyalty, trust, and redemption, adding depth to the characters and the overall storyline.In summary, ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" is a turbocharged joyride that delivers on its promise of high-speed action and excitement. It's a film that knows exactly what it is-a thrilling, visually stunning, and immensely entertaining ride. For fans of the franchise and lovers of adrenaline-pumping cinema, this sequel is a must-watch. Strap in, hold on tight, and get ready for a wild ride through the streets of Miami. Revving the engines and ready to race, this film earns a solid 8/10. Fast, furious, and a whole lot of fun.",Pratyush003,2023-10-27,2023

The cars and cosplays are very well prepared, and the script of the movie is amazing. The movie takes place in Miami. The police arrest Brian during a racing raid. They take Brian to the police station. The police say that if Brian and his friend do their job, all their sentences will be erased. Brian chooses Roman Pierce.

The first two movies are definitely the best ones because they started it all, but this one is my favorite out of the two. This has a mix of all of them; busting drug lords/fighting bad guys, and cars. The newer movies aren't my favorite because they lost the hook with cars, but i love the first ones because they're car centric. I also love this one because of how brian centric it is as well, have a little soft spot for him lmao.

5.0,2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) Is Toretto needed?,"The sequel to Fast and Furious is missing a character who was one of the best things about the previous film. Now, Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) needs to carry the film without the presence of Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel). Unfortunately, Paul Walker's performance is much worse here. Without the presence of his partner, his charisma seems to diminish. Even though the presence of Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) is a positive point to some extent, the characters don't seem to have that strong chemistry. The story is horrible and doesn't hold up with the action scenes. All the secondary characters are terrible and poorly acted. It is an extremely flawed script with an extremely generic narrative and explored in a generic way. That's a huge drop from the first to the second film.",claszdsburrogato,2024-01-07,2024

This serves it's purpose... Loved the movie.. only thing i miss in it is vin Diesel... Paul walker is so frikin charm in this movie.. the music is another plus point . I love movies having quality film making.. it's like ""thallumaala""(a Malayalam(my 1st language) movie which had quality film making) of Hollywood....

The cars racings are so exeptionnals with a lots of cameras shots who are very well and the skyline, the iconic car of the film. Paul Walker is also amazing with his acting and the great chemistry with Tyrese Gibson. It is just amazing. The music are not bad also, the theme is interessant. For me the film is a worthy representative of the fast and furious series and the genre of the action film. I advise at all the people who ridden this review to go, or go again watch this film,who products some emotions who I have never felt.",babatak,2024-01-17,2024
6.0,Entertaining.,"Following a very similar blueprint to the first smash hit - although none of the original cast other than Paul Walker returns for action - 2 Fast 2 Furious transfers the action to Miami, where former cop Brian O'Conner is languishing after being booted from the LAPD.

Arrested following a street race victory, O'Conner is convinced by the FBI to go undercover to catch drug kingpin Carter Verrone (played by Yellowstone's Cole Hauser). To do so, O'Conner needs to enlist the help of an old friend, Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) who he betrayed during his LAPD career. Eva Mendes stars as an undercover agent, deep inside Verrone's operation.

Like I said above, there is a blueprint being followed here: fast cars doing insane things (if you thought the stunts were over the top in the original, have I got news for you on the sequel!), beautiful women, a great soundtrack and spectacular setting. Gary Scott Thompson and co know how to create a box office smash.

Good fun.",allmoviesfan,2024-02-09,2024
6.0,A vibe.,"""2 Fast 2 Furious"" turbocharges the Fast & Furious franchise into a higher gear, trading the original's dark tone for sun-soaked Miami streets and even faster cars. While the plot may not aim for depth, the film succeeds in its mission to deliver high-octane entertainment, capitalizing on the visceral thrill of speed. The absence of Vin Diesel's Dom Toretto shifts the focus to Paul Walker's Brian O'Conner, who dives deeper into the underground racing world. The film's vibrant 90s and early 2000s aesthetic, complete with neon lights and a pulsating soundtrack, perfectly captures a nostalgic era of street racing culture. Despite its narrative simplicity, ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" offers a thrilling ride, emphasizing the joy of the chase and the camaraderie among racers. Its commitment to adrenaline-fueled action and the celebration of automotive culture makes it a worthy sequel that knows exactly what it wants to be: pure, unadulterated fun.",schmittfalte,2024-02-25,2024
5.0,Little boring second opus,"After have saw the first movie of the franchise I expecting a new interesting movie about car racing but this movie about this script is very annoying and boring !The action scenes and the races car are still not bad or even still great but the script is very bad this is kinda movie that you take you take your phone in front of it...Okay is not the same that the one new city, new characters that it was not bad cause the shoots in Florida was good and the character was nice like Eva Longoria is nice actress and I loved the new character of Roman cause is so laugh and for me they make a great duo with Brian you want anymore scene from them together but the script is not at all gripping that the real issue for me !And the last thing very bad it's the no apparition of none role for Vin diesel so bad the franchise miss him but the first scenes and the last are so cool !The character of Roman save a little bit for me this second opus.",tomlaju,2024-04-16,2024
9.0,I love Roman Pearce,"""2 Fast 2 Furious"" is a great sequel, at the levels of the first. The most beautiful thing about this movie is Roman Pearce, one of my 3 favorite characters of the franchise: it makes me laugh and really excited, especially thanks to the wonderful performance of Tyrese Gibson. Also the introduction of other characters, like Tej, is excellent. In my opinion, this point is one of the advantages of this franchise: the perfect insertion of their characters. The actors also do a good job here, but I think it is much less than the first film. Singleton's directing applies to the franchise and I think it does a better job than Cohen's in the first chapter. In my opinion, photography is also of a higher level than the first film. In this film the same technique is used as the prequel: simple and good plot, simple and good writing below. Result: great choice. As I repeat, to be a good racing movie you don't have to have a shocking plot with twists or a very original plot never seen, just entertain the viewer by showing the interesting part of the movie: cars and racing, and this movie does it great! I had a great time, with action scenes not only series but with many comic sides! All due to the presence of the already nominated Roman, the driver of the film. This may have been minimal my personal fifth vision of this film, but it amused me as if it were the first, just like the first film, but like the whole saga, that never tires me..

3.0,It's bad... but what a guilty pleasure,"The plot is even thinner than the first one. The acting, worse. The dialogue, probably all ad-lib (and bad at that). If not ad lib, then shamefully bad. The action, while bigger, not necessarily better. It's also more mainstream with a ""proper villain"", instead of a bunch of ""good criminals"".And yet, I won't deny that I wasn't bored. Probably because I got distracted by the gazillion hot women and Eva Mendes, plus, I actually liked the villain chewing the scene, for whatever reason.So, yeah whatever. This one doesn't fail at being good because I honestly think it doesn't even try it. It's bad. But entertainingly so.",eddmurua,2024-05-17,2024
7.0,Kinda slaps,"2 Fast 2 Furious boldly asks the question ""What if 2000's The Fast and the Furious was good?"", and then confidently follows up on that by being The Fast and the Furious, but good.I was not a fan of that original movie when I saw it for the first time a couple of weeks ago, but this one delivered. It's made me surprised to find that it tends to get called one of the worst in the series. Honestly, if more of them are like this, I could see myself growing attached to the whole stupid franchise as a whole.There are still glaring problems throughout, much of it's corny and overblown, and though the pacing's generally good, a few scenes feel a bit repetitive. Still, everyone seems to be taking this film a little less seriously, not to the point of self-parody, but I appreciated this movie going a little more over-the-top and being just generally crazier.Also, Paul Walker is pretty good here, understanding the assignment and carrying the movie pretty well; also, I think he was better here than he was in the first movie. I didn't like Vin Diesel's performance in the first (he's a charisma vacuum, as far as I'm concerned), so I kind of enjoyed his absence here. I'm hoping that when he returns as a regular, he'll either fit in a little better to what's going on, or everything else will be wild enough that his presence will barely register. That's my Fast and Furious hot-take. So far, I don't like - or want - Diesel in these movies.The action's more fun here and I think it feels a little less slow and dour compared to the first. There's energy and some big action sequences, and I had fun for the majority of the runtime. This is good fast-food cinema, as opposed to the first, which felt like a Big Mac that had mild but still inevitably detrimental amounts of rat poison sprinkled on top.Onwards to Tokyo Drift next, I guess (that one I have actually seen before, but some years ago now).",Jeremy_Urquhart,2024-05-22,2024
5.0,2 Fast 2 Furious 2 easy 2 skip.,"A classic flop sequel that is worse than the original in almost every way. Like FF1, it stays rooted in car culture with some good ""grounded"" car racing, with a lighter buddy cop comedy feel compared to the previous film. Walker and Gibson have a great on-screen relationship, full of homoerotic undertones and cheesy comeback lines.It's a true sequel that is true to the tone of the first, before becoming the over-the-top action franchise it currently is. It introduces series regulars like Gibson and Ludacris, but is it worth rewatching when there are so many other better Fast & Furious movies? Forget about it, cuh..",mediatation,2024-06-17,2024

5.0,2 Fast 2 Furious - Jamison Slabaugh,This film was double the fun in my opinion. The plot in this film is far cooler and more appealing to me. I like the idea of Brian and Rom going undercover as street racers. I think you have less depth with Brian as a character in this film. But I think Roman makes him a stronger character in general. He keeps him in check with the ladies and brings out a different side of him. I really enjoyed the comedic relief that Rom brings. He was absolutely hilarious in this film. I love the friendship that they have. They get some good closer when Rom finally accepts that he got thrown in jail because he was an Idiot. The antagonist was okay. You don't anything about his motives or anything about him besides he loves his girl and he is very very cruel. So the audience does hate him pretty much right away or at least by the rat scene. So he is very cardboard basic antagonist but he works fine for the film. Monica doesn't have to much depth either but she works fine as a spy who's undercover with limited screen time. Some of the twists are very predictable but they still help develop the film. As for the pacing with the low run time it's not really an issue in this film. Overall super funny and a nice thrilling ride. 6/10 STARS.,jamisonslabaugh,2024-07-04,2024
5.0,"""How 'bout them apples, man?""","FILM: 5.5
Rewatching the 2003 film 2 Fast 2 Furious, I find myself feeling rather mixed about it. For me, this film represents the low point of the franchise. Some might say it should have been called 2 Bad 2 Watch. It's entertaining enough, but it lacks the heart and character development of the first film.Tyrese Gibson is a fun addition to the cast, and his chemistry with Paul Walker brings some fresh energy to the film. However, even with Tyrese and Ludacris on board, they can't quite make up for the absence of the original cast. Paul Walker does a fine job, but without Vin Diesel to play off, his character feels a bit flat.The villain in this film is pretty cookie-cutter, lacking the depth and complexity needed to make the conflict truly engaging. The overall plot of undercover operations is very similar to the original, which makes it feel repetitive. It all feels like a slightly glossier, less substantial copy of the original, and the original wasn't all that substantive to begin with.One thing I do appreciate is the film's vibrant visual style. The street races are visually appealing, with flashy cars and dynamic cinematography. The Miami setting adds a distinct flavour to the movie, making it stand out visually, even if the story doesn't quite measure up.Despite its flaws, 2 Fast 2 Furious does have its moments of fun. The banter between characters and the high-speed action sequences keep it from being a total drag. It's a film that I can watch when I'm in the mood for some mindless entertainment, even if it doesn't offer much in terms of depth or innovation.Overall, it's a middling entry in the franchise that provides some amusement but ultimately falls short in delivering a memorable and engaging experience. While it's not a film I'd rush to rewatch, it's a decent enough way to pass the time if you're a fan of the series.FORMAT: Blu-rayVIDEO: 7.5

6.0,An ok follow up to the original classic,"""2 Fast 2 Furious"" offers exactly what you'd expect from a street racing film: fast cars, high-octane action, and plenty of adrenaline. The movie takes a step away from the original film's more grounded tone, leaning more into flashy stunts and larger-than-life action scenes, which makes for an enjoyable popcorn flick.

The chemistry between Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson is a highlight, providing some fun buddy-cop banter and comedic moments. However, the plot is fairly thin and predictable, revolving around an undercover operation that feels a bit recycled. The villains lack depth, and the emotional stakes are minimal, making it harder to feel invested in the characters beyond their flashy cars.

The film excels in its car chases and stunts, but for those looking for more substance in terms of character development or storytelling, ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" falls short. It's a movie that prioritizes style over substance, and while it's fun, it's not particularly memorable.

If you're a fan of fast cars and action for action's sake, you'll likely enjoy the ride. Just don't expect much beyond that.",Bmore-Hero,2024-09-20,2024
8.0,pretty good not too shabby,"2 Fast 2 Furious is a sequel to the first movie called ""The Fast and the Furious"" in the racing movie franchise that was directed by John Singleton that was released on June 6, 2003 in Southern Florida. The main character, Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) who used to be a police officer before relocating to Miami so that he can start a new life there becomes involved in street racing where racers gamble huge chunks of money to whoever wins the race first. Everything goes well 'til the cops show up to the end of the race and eventually catch Brian before he flees the scene. He's given one last chance when the federal agents in Miami need his help to catch a shady businessman, Carter Verone, who's using his large import/export business as a front to launder his drug money in exchange to erase his criminal records. Brian agrees and later works with Monica Fuentes, Carter's mistress who's actually an undercover agent along with his friend Roman who wasn't too happy to see Brian again for what he did to him 3 years ago. I think this film was pretty decent to watch despite the few elements that were missing to this movie such as the absence of Dominic Toretto. I respect the fact that the writers follow the continuity from the first movie that started it all in the franchise and even make references from the first movie but what makes me disappoint is the idea of Brian having another love interest for Monica Fuentes which nearly puts him and his team in trouble so clearly Brian didn't learn back in the plot from Fast and Furious (2001) movie. Other than that, the cast was pretty good. Roman Pearce, played by Tyrese Gibson, was my favorite character in this movie because of how tough, fearless, cocky and funny he was during this movie. Especially the one who plays Carter, Cole Hauser, has a smooth voice and menacing aura through a screen. The cool effects when the cars boost their speeds was alright along with races in this film which felt like they went by quick. Other than that, this movie had the same vibe as the first so overall, I think this film was decent to watch if you're into action and a plot that's really easy to understand.",reyesminijr,2024-10-01,2024
10.0,Pockets ain't empty and we ain't hungry no more!,"Given that the LAPD was searching for him, why would Brian still participate in street races? He's now forced to choose between going to jail or working under cover. Now he's enlisted the help of his childhood friend Rome in an attempt to regain his trust. Making a deal with law enforcement is never simple, especially when corrupt cops are involved. Brian always allows a woman to distract him from the task at hand, causing problems for the partnership. I enjoyed Rome and Brian's competitiveness throughout the film; it made for entertaining viewing. I knew they kept some of the money from Verone's stash I would've did the same thing too.",francoischristana,2024-12-26,2024
9.0,"2 Fast 2 Furious, a movie that's less a sequel and more of a high-octane DLC pack for The Fast and the Furious.","Alright, buckle up, because we're diving headfirst into the neon-drenched streets of Miami with 2 Fast 2 Furious, the movie that's less a sequel and basically more of a high-octane DLC pack for The Fast and the Furious. But let me tell you, it's a damn good DLC. Scoring a solid 9.5 out of 10, this isn't just a good movie, it's a pure shot of adrenaline straight to the veins.Let's be honest, there's not a HUGE leap in formula between 2 Fast 2 Furious and its predecessor. It's the same intoxicating blend of fast cars, dangerous jobs, and a slick, cool vibe that just oozes the early 2000s. And you know what? I'm absolutely here for it. It's like stepping back into a time capsule, but one that's constantly accelerating. It's comfort food for the automotive enthusiast, a cinematic ride that's just as enjoyable in 2025 as it was back in 2003.But what really elevates this film is the injection of fantastic new characters. We have the swaggering, hilarious Roman Pearce, a perfect foil to Brian's more stoic demeanor. Then there's the magnetic Monica Fuentes, an undercover agent who brings not only brains but also undeniable charm. Plus, let's not forget the technological wizard Tej Parker, and the always stylish Suki. Suki, specifically, is a standout. Her bubblegum pink Honda S2000 is a work of art, a rolling embodiment of her vibrant personality. Her fashion sense, bold and unapologetically Y2K, is just as iconic. The whole crew, including the returning Brian O'Conner, forms a dynamic and likable ensemble that keeps you invested in their every move.Beyond the characters, 2 Fast 2 Furious is a feast for the senses. The soundtrack is an absolute banger, a perfect mix of hip-hop and electronica that perfectly amplifies the energy of the street races and the nail-biting action sequences. And let's talk about the women. There's an undeniable natural beauty and effortless coolness to the aesthetic of the 2000s and this film captures that perfectly. The cars, of course, are the real stars, from the iconic Skyline to the aforementioned S2000. Each car is a character in itself, meticulously detailed and brought to life with incredible cinematography. The film takes you to a car enthusiast's heaven and I mean, what's better than that?Ultimately, 2 Fast 2 Furious doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it doesn't try to. Instead, it doubles down on everything that made the first movie so fun, adding a host of memorable new faces, a killer soundtrack, and some truly stunning vehicles. This movie is just a blast, pure and simple. It's a testament to the enduring power of simple, high-octane entertainment. If you're looking for pure, unadulterated fun, grab some popcorn, crank up the volume, and buckle up for the ride. 2 Fast 2 Furious still delivers the goods, years later. It's a must-watch for any fan of the franchise, and a guaranteed good time for anyone looking for some high-octane thrills.",douglasc11,2025-01-03,2025
6.0,A fun ride that I would go on again,"There are enough indications that this movie isn't quite as good as the original which is to be expected, but it excels in new ways like comedy. The action sequences are great and the final chase scene is really well done. There are just a few too many places where it moves too slowly, or the action and dialogue feel too cringe, where it is clear that this one deserves a star less than the original. With that said, I would still watch this one again because it is fun. The action is fun to watch, the cringe factor is fun to make fun of, and there is a happy ending. Eva Mendes is reason enough to watch the movies and Ludacris does well in this one too.",jaredlemin,2025-01-09,2025
5.0,2 Fast 2 Furious - When Tuning Outshines the Plot,"Brian O'Conner is back, wind in his hair and a sparkling white smile, proving that even without Vin Diesel, you can crash through set pieces without ever hitting the brakes. But despite Paul Walker giving it his all, it's like trying to drift a diesel Clio-it's missing torque and soul. Without Toretto, the movie feels as empty as a Lamborghini with an absent passenger: flashy but lacking the grunt.If the plot feels a bit dry, don't worry-Tyrese Gibson's here to grease the gears with his corny jokes and his ""I've-got-a-bad-idea-but-let's-do-it-anyway"" attitude. Sure, his humor is on par with high school locker room banter, but his charm and toothpaste-ad grin smooth over the rough spots.The FBI hiring Brian to infiltrate a crime boss? Yeah, right. It's basically an excuse stitched together with floss to justify lining up car chases, slo-mo shots of waxed hoods, and perfectly polished rims. The setup screams Need for Speed: Underground meets Miami Vice, but with the depth of a Sunday afternoon TV flick.Then there's Eva Mendes, the human neon light flashing through every scene. She's eye candy, undeniably captivating, but you know her presence is a distraction from a plot that coughs and sputters like a poorly tuned engine. Sure, she does her part, but even her charm can't fix dialogue that feels like it was written during a caffeine crash.Let's be real: nobody's here for meaningful conversations. The real stars are the pimped-out rides and the slow-motion close-ups of bikinis. This is mechanical and visual eye candy-a full-on car porn extravaganza. But like most flashy desserts, too much frosting leaves you feeling a bit sick of the sugar.2 Fast 2 Furious is the visual equivalent of a greasy cheeseburger. It hits the spot in the moment, but you'll forget the taste within an hour. If you're here for roaring engines, glowing undercarriages, and Tyrese's teenage one-liners, then buckle up and enjoy. If you want something with a little more meat on the bones, maybe revisit the first one where at least there was a bit of flavor under the hood.",OniFR,2025-02-04,2025
