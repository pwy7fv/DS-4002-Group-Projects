128,10.0,Adrenaline Rush - Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift is a solid good third entry action flick!,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) in my opinion I think is a solid good action sequel, a very bashed and hated in the series. Which I don't think this movie is bad, I think is a much better movie than Furious 7. I always loved this movie, I think it is a good movie, but in the series is not the worst one, but is far from worst one that would be Furious 7. I think it was a different solid, good sequel in the series and I love it for an action film. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a fun movie to watch: it accomplishes what it set out to do and that's provide the most realistic yet gravity-defying racing sequences, backed with the eye-catching background of the electrifying, neon Tokyo. Plot-wise it suffers a bit and the acting isn't top-notch, otherwise the loud music, import cars, cityscape Tokyo, and Japanese pop culture more than make up for the flaws of the film that you'll watch it again and again.Plot: When convicted street racer Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) tries to start a new life on the other side of the world, his obsession with racing sets him on a collision course with the Japanese underworld. To survive, he will have to master drifting—a new style of racing where tricked-out cars slide through hairpin turns, defying gravity and death for the ultimate road rush.This movie is more the highest-octane installment of the hit movie franchise built for speed! There are more mind-blowing stunts and heart-pounding racing sequences than ever, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift will put you in the driver's seat. ""Strap yourself in for a blistering, super-charged ride.""-- Pete Hammond, Maxim"" The CGI I am sorry but in one way it is terrible which I really did not like when Sean (Lucas Black) and Neela (Nathalie Kelley) are slide down with the car during the car chase and they cross over the crowd of people without hitting anyone, you can see the camera, that it is made with a CGI that is the only main problem I have with the film, the rest was okay. This is a very simple film, not a big confusing plot and again this films, you know 5,6 and 7 the plots are still pretty simplistic.5 was a heist movie, 6 was this guy the evil version of you, we want him to bring him down simple.7 you killed this guy's brother, he is looking for revenge and he also try's to kill you so you get this, simple movie not complicate at all. That is one thing that this movies get right constantly.The racing in this movie: I think they did a better job than in 2, because I didn't noticed more of a CGI, because that's how they just do it now, a lot of wide shot you can tell there was a lot of practical stunt drive, it look good which I enjoyed that. I know a lot of people will put this movie lover down and I think it is a solid movie and a solid flick. This is the first time Brian Tyler made the score and this is also the first one that Justin Lin directed, he went later directing three next movies 4,5 and 6 which I love to death. I thought the direction is good, I like the resolves on the end of the movie, the sound track is good, I did not mind the cast you know. Lucas Black is the lead in this movie. Sonny Chiba is in this movie I always like the actor. This was Sung Kang's first introduction of his character Han who later appeared in 4 as a cameo, than in 5 and 6 as regular cast. Vin Diesel did returned with his character Dominic Toretto, who made a cameo scene on the end of the movie, which I thought was pretty cool. Bow Wow I didn't mind him in this movie and Nathalie Kelley was extremely hot and I really though she was much better sexy babe, than Eva Mendes was in 2 Fast 2 Furious. Nathalie Kelley lights up the screen as Neela and I would welcome her return to the series any time.Overall: Tokyo Drift gets a solid 8 by me it does lacks on the great characters and the cast of the first two movies in the series, but is redeemed by Han, awesome car scenes and a pounding score from Brian Tyler. I have enjoyed this movie and I think it is a solid action movie, I love this film and it is a step above than 2 Fast 2 Furious by me.The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a 2006 American action film directed by Justin Lin, produced by Neal H.

129,3.0,Bad,"In this week (Sunday 20th - Sunday 27th) I will watch all Fast and Furious movies. One per day. The first one was pretty good. The second was disappointing. The third was more disappointing… ‘Fast and furious: Tokyo Drift’ is just a bad excuse to watch racing games. The first Fast and furious had a good story. It was better in many different ways. It was packed with lot of action and well played characters. If you want to watch a good and exciting movie, then don't watch this. The story is bad, the acting in the movie was bad. To put it mildly: Do not watch this movie! PS. Sorry for my English! :)",tullemis,2016-03-23,2016,0.173,0.637,0.19,-0.3786,Negative
130,4.0,Catch my drift,"Despite featuring none of the stars (but for a surprise cameo at the end) from the original films, this third instalment and its modest box office success convinced Universal Pictures that there was mileage in the Fast and Furious series.Director Justin Lin re-tooled the franchise, introduced the elements and a kinetic style that would carry on when Paul Walker and Vin Diesel return for the fourth part.Tokyo Drift has the southern drawl of Lucas Black who plays Sean Boswell a troublesome teenager regularly in trouble with the police. A disastrous drag race against a rich kid is too much for his mother who sends him to Tokyo to live with his father and attend high school there even though he does not speak a word of Japanese he apparently goes to a regular school rather than some international one.Before long Sean flirts with the girlfriend of DK (the drift king) who is the nephew of the Yakuza kingpin and falls in with the underground racing scene that features the skill of drifting.Sean starts to work for the mysterious hustler Han (Sung Kang) who teaches him how to drift and he ends up challenging DK for top dog status after a tragic accident.Although largely set in Japan the film still manages to have a multi ethnic cast and an urban soundtrack that the films have become noted for. However the story is thin, there are no outlandish heists or preposterous plotting. Lucas Black is just too blank as the lead and it is no surprise that the enigmatic Sung Kang was the more intriguing actor hence why he featured in the subsequent films.Do note that a crash scene was later retconned in the closing credits of Fast & Furious 6.The film has its flaws but it is also an important chapter in the creative team of Lin and Morgan. They would continue with the Fast & Furious films, bring back the original stars and makes this into one of the most profitable modern franchises around.",Prismark10,2016-07-07,2016,0.109,0.779,0.112,-0.4822,Negative
131,4.0,Pointless instalment in the series,"TOKYO DRIFT is the unwanted second sequel in a film franchise that seems to have absolutely zero point in existing – unless it's to get teenage boys to part with their pocket money. Each film is a stultifying excuse for flashy cars to be raced around and wrecked while attractive women in little clothing look on and cheer or boo as required. The first movie saw Vin Diesel playing a bone-headed racer in one of his worst performances; the sequel kicked him away and left wooden leading man Paul Walker to make a mess of his duties. This film does away with them both in favour of Lucas Black, a guy who I used to like when he was a child actor in '90s TV series American Gothic.Nowadays Black is all grown up and as typically handsome-but-wooden as any other actor. He seems to have lost his charisma but then all the cast of this film live in a charisma-free zone. The light story sees him packed off to Japan to curb his racing tendencies, but inevitably he runs foul of a Yakuza gang when he starts racing again. It's same old, same old, with stock supporting characters and an uninteresting cast – aside from a cameoing Sonny Chiba, still proving his worth in a fun role as a mob boss.These films are all about the races and these ones are pretty predictable. There are some interesting crashes and a few stunts here and there, but my heart wasn't really in any of them. I could enjoy the explosive chases in a film like DEATH RACE but I couldn't stop yawning as I watched the races here. They're serviceable perhaps but they're not going to set anybody's world alight. Then the film ends with a laughable twist that sets things up for yet another needless sequel. When are these guys going to give up?",Leofwine_draca,2016-07-10,2016,0.039,0.831,0.13,0.9834,Positive
132,4.0,The dude looks 40,"If you are looking for some backup noise while you do some housework this is great for that. Other than that it's really bad. The main character is so irritating and awful, every scene he was in I couldn't help but think This dude looks 40, what the hell is he doing in a high school? He suppose to be someone who don't really care about school only cars, yet he learns perfect Japanese in a few weeks. And this is just one annoying thing, the story has so many plot holes , I stopped counting. Why is he sent to Japan in the first place, who sends criminals to live in a foreign country as a punishment? If his father is in military why don't they live in the military base? And why does the Yakusa have any interest in high school drifting? And so on....

133,4.0,The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift Review,"The Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift(2006) Starring: Lucas Black, Shad Moss, Nathalie Kelley, Brian Tee, Suang Kang, Brian Goodman, Sonny Chiba, Leonardo Nam, Jason Tobin, Keiko Kitagawa, Alden Villaverde, Koji Kataoka, Kevin Ryan, Lynda Boyd, and Vin Disel Directed By: Justin Lin Review On the streets of Tokyo, speed needs no translation... You know I was never big fan of the whole Fast & Furious franchise until I saw five then they made six which I did not see, and seven which I will see even though I said I wasn't going too, because I love watching films no matter what and I want to respect Paul Walker. But Fast Five will always remain as one of my favorite films of all time and my second favorite high powered car film, my first is Speed Racer. This third entry from the series is when people became curious of the franchise, it revolves around a guy who gets kicked out of America for street racing and moves in with his dad in Tokyo. When he gets there he meets a group of people who are drifters, one in particular is the Drift king. You see Han from the fifth film(snacking as usual) and he likes the kid so he teaches him how to drift. Han is also stealing money from the Drift king and he wants to take down and his new prodigy with speed in the fast lane. The film wasn't all that fun which is what these movies are meant to be, their meant to be fun action movies . But the only fun out of this film like the first two is the street racing. That's it. Not any fights, not any characters, not even any shoot outs. This film just lacked the amount of fun you would want in an action film. The performances in this film are as bland as butter, the only one who seemed to be trying where Suang Kang and Brian Tee they were the only ones I bought in this movie. Everyone else is just bland or terrible. Don't even get me started on Bow Wow, the credit shows him as Shad Moss being the actors name but my TV said Bow Wow so I think LetterBox is wrong on that. But yeah he was the worst thing about this movie. The Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift does have cool car sequences but also a watered down and uninteresting plot, bad acting and characters you can't get into, I'm giving this drifter a two out of five.",Spideyfan-963-246215,2016-09-08,2016,0.082,0.787,0.13,0.9713,Positive
134,1.0,Forgettable,"How can I describe The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift in one word? I would have to say ""forgettable."" I'm a huge fan of the Fast and the Furious movies. I think they're awesome. I watched Tokyo Drift once on TV. I wasn't impressed. After having loved The Fast and the Furious and 2 Fast 2 Furious, I hated Tokyo Drift. After that, I really had no interest to see Tokyo Drift again. But I saw it a second time only because I was hanging out with friends and one of the guys turned it on. I didn't leave. I watched it and decided to see if it would be better a second time around. The opening to Tokyo Drift really wasn't anything special. The race was nothing great. Especially when you compare it to the first impressive race they had to start off 2 Fast 2 Furious. The protagonist we are introduced to is Sean Boswell, but there is really no immediate reason to really like him. I also guessed from the beginning of the movie that the soundtrack was going to be terrible. And oh boy was I right. This movie had one of the lamest soundtracks ever. The storyline to the movie isn't really that original or interesting. It's basically Karate Kid and Karate Kid Part II, only with racing. The writers were clearly inspired by those movies instead of the previous Fast and the Furious movies when they wrote this. There's the new guy moving to a new place and starting at a new school. He meets a girl he likes, the girl has a mean boyfriend. The mean boyfriend and main villain of the movie is D.K. D.K is a cross between Johnny Lawrence from Karate Kid and Chozen from Karate Kid Part II. Only unlike Johnny, instead of kicking the protagonist's ass and humiliating him with karate, D.K. does it in a race. Sean, our very dull hero, realizes that racing in Tokyo is a hell of a lot different. It's a different kind of racing called drifting. He is taken under someone's wing and trains. D.K., like Chozen, gives our hero a beating, gets dishonored in the movie, and even has a powerful uncle that he respects and fears. There was one interesting idea in the whole movie and that was the new way of racing. They decided to try something new with the drifting. Personally, I prefer the good old street racing from The Fast and the Furious and 2 Fast 2 Furious. But hey, they wanted to try something new with Tokyo Drift. Unfortunately, the other new things just didn't cut it. The cast of Tokyo Drift was nowhere near as good as the solid casts they had in the other Fast and the Furious movies. The villain in Tokyo Drift is a weak villain, the love interest, Nathalie Kelley was nothing special, Sung Kang was nothing special, and Bow Wow just wasn't a good casting choice. Seriously, Bow Wow? Finally, I have to get to the star of the movie, Lucas Black. Lucas Black couldn't top Paul Walker or Vin Diesel. I didn't think he was going to. How could anyone? But he was just a terrible leading man. He was dull and boring and had zero charisma. Paul Walker and Vin Diesel are certainly not dull or boring. And they both have charisma. They were able to use that charisma to make you cheer them on and root for them as you watched the movie. I don't know what they were thinking when they cast Lucas Black to play the hero. I saw this movie twice and both times were out of curiosity. The first time, I wondered what it was. The second time, I wondered if I'd like it more. The movie didn't come through. To all of you Fast and the Furious fans out there that absolutely love this franchise, skip Tokyo drift and go straight to Fast and Furious. It featured Paul Walker and Vin Diesel and that was the way it started and should have stayed. Okay, 2 Fast 2 Furious didn't have Vin Diesel. But Paul Walker did great carrying the movie and Tyrese was just fine. Tokyo Drift had no one to carry the movie or save the movie. Seeing the Fast and the Furious movies that followed Tokyo Drift only make you realize more how bad Tokyo Drift really was. If you decided to start a Fast and the Furious collection, great. But I'd leave Tokyo Drift out and focus on the other movies that have everything you could want in a movie. We definitely could have done without Tokyo Drift. It's a shame they decided to tie it in to the rest of the movies because it was unnecessary. We also could've done without Sun Kang's character Han. And just in case you're wondering, Lucas Black wasn't used for the rest of the movies. He only showed up once and for a minute in Furious 7 to help tie in Tokyo Drift. The dull Lucas Black and his character are, like Tokyo Drift, forgettable.",mercury4,2016-09-19,2016,0.167,0.69,0.144,-0.9838,Negative
135,7.0,It's All Drifting,"OK Now I'm on Tokyo Drift .... Let's see, What I like about TD is the introduction of H A N Z. I love him in this installment with his fine self. I love his calm cool demeanor and those eyes. Yes those eyes ... He came in and played himself it's not like he took on the role of any of the other characters but then again I guess that may have been part of being allowed to use the franchise name and continue to push out installments. Just in case the originals ever got on the same page and in agreement to all come back and do another installment. But this installment I like because of the ""drifting"". It was a fresh and new at the time and I thought it was some of the better drifting I'd ever seen had me wishing I could do that and wanting to move to Tokyo ....I'm such a big kid, I know LOL. I don't think Bow Wow brought anything to the line up or the franchise. He was like a Luda type character. All the while I'm sitting here typing this review I'm watching TD and other than the drifting and Hanz, it was not as good as I remember.",hersheedontplay,2016-11-24,2016,0.036,0.791,0.173,0.982,Positive
136,6.0,Far better than the previous two,"Well, it is rather odd that IMDb is labeling this movie as a romance because I would hardly say that it is a romance beyond any other action movie that has a romantic element in it (and there are very few action movies that don't have a romantic element in them, but just because boy gets girl doesn't make the movie a romance). Anyway, what surprised me about this film is that there was no connection between this film and the last two (with the exception of a Vin Diesal cameo), and further more it didn't follow the lines of an undercover cop come drag racer infiltrating an illegal drag racing ring. In fact this film is probably more what the first film should have been as opposed to what it turned out as (though we should note that this film is set in Japan as opposed to the United States so there are some cultural differences that are relevant).So what we have in this film is the story of a rebel, Sean, who get his first speeding ticket the day after he got his driver's license, and is a bit of a loner namely because his carefree attitude means that his mother has to keep on moving. Anyway he lands up in another drag race which results in the destruction of two cars and a housing estate, and since the other participants have really rich parents he is the one who has to take the rap. So, he is sent to Japan to live with his father. The problem is that this is the type of guy that always seems to find trouble, and since he is a gaijin (non-Japanese), he ends up hanging with the other gaijin, and gets involved with illegal street racing there as well. The thing is that racing in Japan is vastly different from racing in the United States. Whereas in the US you have flat surfaces and long straight roads, you don't have that in Japan. As such racing here involves going up and down carparking lots and mountains in a form of racing called 'drifting'. Basically drifting involves navigating tight turns at high speeds without causing damage to the car, and winning the race. This is something Sean doesn't realise when he lands up in this new world – the rules of racing back in the United States – the 10 second race – don't apply here. In a way this film is similar to the other films, but different, and a part of me feels that this addition to the franchise kicked it off to the extent that it is now up to film number seven, though the rumour was that the actors in the previous films were not too keen on coming back and that this was going to be a reboot. However, what impressed me was that the story was completely different, though I would hardly call it original. In a sense it is one of those fish out of water stories, the story of a guy that simply wants to belong but has a lot of trouble doing so. We see this at the beginning of the film where we seems to wander around without any real friends. Obviously this changes once he gets to Japan since being different he is able to attract others who are different as well. Mind you, the one criticism that I do have of the film is that Sean clearly knows no Japanese so it makes me wonder how it is that he is going to learn anything in a Japanese school (and it was pretty clear that they taught in Japanese). Also, isn't it interesting that they always go after the girl that they can't have, and eventually get her. It doesn't really send a strong message to our impressionable youth. Mind you, the fact that the two protagonists in this film refer to women as 'their girls' doesn't do much in the way of dismantling the objectification of women, and further that one of the girls puts herself forward as the prize for the winner of the race is even worse. No wonder Hillary lost.",The-Sarkologist,2016-12-02,2016,0.086,0.803,0.111,0.9701,Positive
137,6.0,"The Worst Of ""TFATF"" Movies, But Still Worth Watching","The third movie in the ‘Fast And The Furious’ movies — but chronologically takes place much later in the series — has a teenager (played by Lucas Black) sent to school in Tokyo because he's been a naughty boy in America and his illegal racing activities will get him sent to prison unless he goes to another country to live with his father. Huh? What? Hey, never mind this isn't a movie about logic and realism. Anyway Black is now in Tokyo, gets the hots for a classmate who is dating a gangster (played by Brian Tee), and is introduced to drifting (a controlled, sideways movement of a fast moving car). Ah! ‘Tokyo Drift’ you say with a big grin. Not wanting to look like a punk who can't drive, Black is taken under the wing of ‘TFATF’ alumni Han (played by Sung Kang) to be taught how to drift so Black can settle all his problems by racing and drifting. Makes sense? No? Well, it's not supposed to! This movie is for people who like to drive fast cars and want to see crazy, fast driving in the movies. I'm one of those people, but I also appreciate a well-written story. Oh, well, at least I get half of what I want. My most memorable, movie moment of ‘The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift’ is the scene when **SPOILER ALERT** Kang is being chased by Tee, and Kang's car flips over and explodes, killing Kang. Why is this so memorable to me? Because the Han character played by Kang is my favorite in all of ‘TFATF’ movies. Although ‘Tokyo Drift’ is my least favorite movie of this series, it still ties in to the storyline, especially to the later movies, so it's a must see for ‘TFATF’ fans.

138,5.0,A Different Type of Street Racing,"Constantly in trouble due to illegal racing, a high school senior named ""Sean Boswell"" (Lucas Black) is sent to live with his father who is in the military and stationed in Japan. When he gets there he immediately gravitates to a group of other students his age who are also involved in racing fast cars. However, because of the limited space in Tokyo the sport has changed to one that involves negotiating extremely tight corners in either an underground parking garage or a narrow road along the side of a mountain. The problem Sean has is not only that he is not used to this type of racing-known as drift racing--but also that his main rival is an arrogant punk named ""Takashi"" (Brian Tee) who is extremely jealous whenever his girlfriend, ""Neela"" (Nathalie Kelley) even looks at another guy. And there is some definite chemistry between her and Sean. It also doesn't help that Takashi thinks he can do whatever he wants because his uncle, ""Kamata"" (Sonny Chiba) is a high-ranking member of the Yakuza. One other problem is that Takashi is also extremely good at drift racing. In any case, with all of these areas of disagreement it is only a matter of time before Sean and Takashi have it out and when they do the stakes will be very high. Now, rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie certainly had some good moments here and there. Unfortunately, there were some scenes which were a little over-the-top and which caused the film to seem a bit uneven. That being the case, I rate this movie as about average and recommend it only to those who might enjoy a film of this type.",Uriah43,2017-01-15,2017,0.086,0.859,0.055,-0.8707,Negative
140,5.0,Drifting Into Franchise Turmoil,"It's been well documented how the F&F franchise was pretty much garbage before The Rock came on to the series, and Tokyo Drift is more of the same. I had never sat through the entire runtime until now, and just as I thought, it's definitely not one of the better ones.In fact, Tokyo Drift is the second worst of the series, just in front of its predecessor, 2 Fast 2 Furious. This installment takes the series abroad, as we watch Sean Boswell played by Lucas Black, get brought back into the dangerous game of street racing and become acquainted with the technique of drifting. Boswell is supposed to be a teenager who gets sent away to live with his father in Tokyo after getting into trouble one too many times back home in Arizona. Black doesn't look young enough to be in high school, nor do I really see the need for the writers to make him in high school. Why not just make him a high school drop-out, a few years removed from a structured life, and someone looking for a place to call home. Perhaps, even refer to him as a constant ""drifter"". Poor Pun? Probably.With no sign of Paul Walker or Vin Diesel, Tokyo Drift is forced to carry on with actors who are better off served in supporting roles. Surprisingly, there isn't that one character or performance that's distractingly over-the-top like in the previous two adventures. At the same time, there's nothing all that special about any of the characters to begin with. There's certainly more of an attempt to add depth to the characters, with both the protagonist and antagonist having some serious family issues, but it's not fleshed out in an interesting way. Instead, most of it is addressed in a disappointingly cliché manner.You can tell there's something refreshing about Justin Lin's direction. He isn't repeating the same beats as the first two films in the same way that 2 Fast 2 Furious did. The decision to take it outside America and bring new cars and new characters was probably the correct choice, but it could have handled better. In the same vein, the lack of creativity in the plot is puzzling. Introducing an antagonistic uncle to Takashi who I think runs some sort of shady business was unnecessary. Not only did they refuse to really address the nature of his work but I'm not sure he added anything of value to the story, at all.Does it matter that the second and third F&F movies are poor? Not really. With where the series is now, it doesn't really matter to me that the first few films struggled to find the right tone. What's important is that they have found the right speed now.

141,8.0,"No rats in buckets, no CGI, just an entertaining flick featuring excellent car racing","Branching away from any original cast members of the first two films, thankfully, Tokyo Drift provides a refreshingly new look to the franchise.Tokyo Drift is possibly my favourite of the series, or at least its up there with the first film; it only has a few problems that can be swept under the ""It's Fast and the Furious, what do you expect"" carpet. The story follows American ""teenager"" Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) whose reckless driving lands him prison time, but to avoid this he moves in with his father in Tokyo. He attempts to move on a dangerous rival's girl, and must become a competitor in the street racing's drifting scene.I say ""teenager"" as that's what IMDb says, and he does go to school in the movie but honestly, he's the oldest teen I've ever seen. Along with every other ""teen"" in this movie! While I talk negatives, the majority of the film is set in Tokyo yet 95% of the dialogue is English and Sean has a knack of meeting every foreigner in the city. I don't mind this so much, but I fully expect all of the Japanese characters to speak Japanese, especially when Sean isn't present!But, unlike 2 Fast 2 Furious (choke) this film actually cares for its characters and their personalities (as Sean says early on: ""It's not about the ride, it's about the rider"") from Sean's fish-out-of- water acceptance, to his mentor Han's closet of skeletons. The villain isn't ridiculous either, his uncle is part of the Yakuza and he has a serious ""king of a little hill"" problem. Again unlike 2 Fast 2 Furious (gag) the cars have never looked better, sleek and refined and the drifting action is spectacular, especially when synchronized. Plus, no CGI, just skilled professional drivers, making the film worth seeing solely for the racing.There's no stupid Tyrese Gibson mugging at the camera, no rats in buckets, no CGI, just an entertaining (albeit poorly localized) flick featuring excellent car racing and professional stunts.",CinemaCocoa,2017-04-12,2017,0.139,0.779,0.082,-0.97,Negative
142,4.0,The weakest of the F&F series,"The third installment in what was once the Fast and the Furious trilogy was a near total reboot with new characters and a new location. Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) is a troubled teen whose mother ship's him out to live with his military father in Tokyo. He encounters Twinkie (Bow Wow) who introduces him to the underground street racing culture of Tokyo. He flirts with Neela (Nathalie Kelley) and is challenged to a race by D.K. (Brian Tee). Loaned a car by Han (Sung Kang), Sean is introduced to drifting and the complication of trying to make the tight turns of this Japanese racing style. He destroys the car, loses the girl, and finds himself in debt to Han. Forced to carry out chores for Han, Sean makes a deal where he can learn how to drift as he familiarized himself with the underworld of Tokyo. Han takes him under his wing but there is trouble brewing with D.K.'s illegal business. With the help of Twinkie, Sean practices the art of drifting and attends his Japanese high school.

143,5.0,Change Of Pace Doesn't Seem Too Fresh,"First,the good,the cameos,they may seem unimportant,but they're very cool and honor the past.The racing,it is a bit different,and I like how there is a lot more practical stunts than CGI.I liked that the races were part of the plot,and even though it wasn't the best,the plot did flow nicely.Some characters,like Han and Twinkie(yes that's his name)were decently acted and entertaining.The main character had a few good scenes as well.The best part is the new setting of Tokyo,it is very different and the movie does a good job of exploring the racing culture.Now,the bad,the characters,they aren't nearly as memorable as the originals,and aren't acted the best.The main character is pretty wooden,and the villain had a weak motivation and wasn't that threatening or entertaining,he was just an asshole.The action,it all feels the same,but it's still pretty good.The movie mainly suffers from being unmemorable.All in all,Tokyo Drift has good racing scenes and a nice setting,but it also has weak characters and isn't the most memorable,it probably should've been a direct to DVD movie.",jordansepticeye,2017-04-17,2017,0.061,0.75,0.189,0.9754,Positive
144,6.0,the 3rd one is so much better then the 1st.,I did not like The fast and the furious. But I like this movie. 2 fast and 2 furies is better. Fast and furious new model original parts is also better. Fast five is also better. Fast and Furious 6 is also better. Furious 7 is also better. But still this movie has a great story line. It also has great acting. See it. It is one of the best action movies from 2006. This is a lot better then V for vendetta that movie stinks. But this movie is so mush better. It is very fast past. See this movie. It is a great movie. You need to see this movie. If you like action movies you like this movie. I is awesome. See it. It is a great movie. A lot of action. You need to see it.

145,10.0,This was the ONE movie of the franchise connecting all others,"*** This review may contain spoilers *** When I first heard about Tokyo Drift and realized that it would feature none of the original cast members, I was hesitant to see it. Can you imagine what a risk the producers took to make this one? At that time we did not know it was the ONE movie of the franchise connecting all others with one of its major characters. Sung demonstrated a lot of talent, making his heartbroken character believable. We see his emotions throughout the movie and we want to know what happened to him, to understand him a little better. After watching Fast 6 come back and see this one. It will all add up. I've seen so many reviews saying that character development was too hurried, for those saying that I only want to say this: Have you watched all the movies???? It annoys me so much seeing people review without knowing what these movies are about. Tokyo Drift takes place after 6, which shows how much effort the writers and producers put into this franchise. It was all written way back. To have that imagination is effing amazing. When I first saw Tokyo Drift, I could not see what it had to do with The Fast and Furious series. I got mad. I just couldn't get it. Funny thing is that the character I loved the most was HAN. My brain was blow away when I saw the other movies. I was like ‘What's happening? Isn't he dead?’ ‘What? How? When?’ So you can imagine that after knowing he's going to die seeing the relationship developing with Gisele was killing me. Now I could see why he wasn't giving a s**t. Like, he was the coolest out there without showing it. Why wasn't he claiming his spot? Because he lost everything that really mattered to him. Ride or die, remember? What a way to blow our minds. You killed it with the whole plot dear writers. I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF THE 8 MOVIES launched so far. And yes, I will be a die hard fan of this franchise even when I'm 50. Thank you Sung Kang and Gal Gadot for giving me one of my favorite on screen couples with just a few scenes.",andrbdeea,2017-04-20,2017,0.113,0.789,0.098,-0.871,Negative
146,4.0,The black sheep of the fast and furious franchise,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift was prime evidence that the franchise desperately needed a makeover. Not only did it dispose of its popular protagonist in exchange for a cheap lookalike, but also, aside from a couple cool race scenes, it's really just a huge mess. The plot simply advances because the writers need it to, there aren't any real substantial plot elements that keep the audience involved. The story itself seems just like a rehash of any classic gang feud film, and it comes as no surprise to me that the franchise was turned towards high-octane heist films. That transition was definitely for the better, because this formula quickly ran thin.Not even a quick appearance from Vin Diesel could save this film, as his appearance only served to up audience ratings before its release. It may seem like a cool little nod to the previous films, but it doesn't make me care about this new character any more than I already didn't. The film's look is extremely dated, even for 2006. It felt like a real step back from 2 Fast 2 Furious, rather than a revolutionization of the series. I wouldn't have minded Paul Walker's absence if these characters could have held their own, but sadly they just fall flat before the story can even pick up steam.This is probably my least favorite entry in the franchise, and not because Paul Walker wasn't in it. While his absence didn't help matters, the story as a whole felt very uneven and didn't flow through very well. It was pretty unbelievable at times as well, not because of the stunts, but because of the plot itself. Certain things happen just for the sake of happening, with no real substance or process shown in between. It's too convenient to be a good film, despite the stylish driving tactics. Drifting car races are the highlights of the film, but everything in between is just too pointless and shallow to make this a good film. It's a mediocre at best effort, and the weakest entry in the franchise.",ryanskywalker-87402,2017-04-21,2017,0.099,0.754,0.147,0.971,Positive
147,4.0,"Only worth watching as part of the full ""F&F"" series, and after 6","In 2006, ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" undoubtedly deserved to be panned by critics. The series had fallen so far off the course that only its ugliest, most formulaic bits stayed alive. It's only as part of the franchise that was revived three years later and has gone on to become a billion-dollar enterprise that ""Tokyo Drift"" reclaims some sense of its dignity.Let's get the good out of the way. ""Tokyo Drift"" was a vital proving ground for director Justin Lin, who would go on to make the next three ""Fast & Furious"" movies. His work on this entry was too good for the material, frankly. His shot variety and the editing team give the film a legitimate action feel that the first two films don't even come close to touching. As much as the film overloads on race sequences, Lin nails them.As for why screenwriter Chris Morgan got the long-term gig for this franchise after his work on this film, consider me stumped. The story of Alabama teenager Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) shipping off to Tokyo, discovering the drift racing scene and burrowing his way into the innermost circle is ambitiously preposterous.Obviously the plot of the ""Fast & Furious"" movies is known to be second fiddle to a handful of other components, but this particular plot has some problems as far as race – and unfortunately not the car kind of race, but the people kind. In a nutshell, the story of ""Tokyo Drift"" is misunderstood troubled white teenager flees the consequences of his actions to Tokyo where his dad lives, defies his father's wishes, asserts himself into a racing gang, stands up to the cocky Japanese ""Drift King"" (Brian Tee), tries to steal the man's girlfriend (Nathalie Kelley), earns the trust of his partner (Sung Kang) and ultimately aims to prove he's better than him. Only one of the five major characters in this movie is actually Japanese, and it's the bad guy. The movie is very interested in appropriating Japanese culture and aesthetics for its mostly non- Japanese cast. For starters you have Black, who looks like he's in his thirties and is playing a teenager. Boswell is also written to have the same personality and temperament as Paul Walker's O'Conner, so he's essentially a stand-in/replacement. As for Boswell's first friend, he's of course played by a black rap star (Shad Moss a.k.a. ""Bow Wow"") and the girl he's after? She's an ethnic Australian. Tee's D.K. is painted as the bully, so he doesn't stand as much of an exception. Only Kang's character Han has dimension beyond stereotype, but Kang is a Korean-American actor. The producers' foresight to bring the Han character into future ""Fast & Furious"" films and paint ""Tokyo Drift"" as taking place after the sixth movie was surprisingly astute. When viewed after the next three films instead of before, Han becomes more than just the most interesting character in the movie, but the character we're most interested in given his character arc in those other films. It also makes the movie's surprising cameo at the end make a lot of sense. All this to say, ""Tokyo Drift"" might be garbage as a standalone movie, but given what the franchise has become, Morgan used future movies to position what once seemed like an accident/stop-gap film into being a spin-off. In other words, if you're going to put yourself through ""Tokyo Drift,"" do it after watching the fourth, fifth and sixth ""Fast & Furious"" movies. Lin's style does give ""Tokyo Drift"" some additional value, but for most people it won't be enough to watch it under any other circumstance but as part of the series.~Steven CThanks for reading!

148,6.0,It's passable but not as good as the first: Would Recommend,"Directed by Justin LinStarring Lucas Black, Natallie Kelley and Sung KangPlot Overview: ​Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) always feels like an outsider, but he defines himself through his victories as a street racer. His hobby makes him unpopular with the authorities, so he goes to live with his father in Japan. Once there and even more alienated, he learns about an exciting, but dangerous, new style of the sport. The stakes are high when Sean takes on the local champion and falls for the man's girlfriend.After two very successful movie(commercially not critically), Justin Lin had a tough time trying to continue the franchise with none of the original cast members in it and I respect how good this movie is in spite of that. That doesn't make the movie 'good' however. It's a perfectly passable movie that I can see myself watching maybe every once and a while but it lacks a certain intrigue the first one contained and a neat charm the second possessed. The transition of directors in a franchise can be difficult and I understand that. I will also admit that it's better than '2 Fast 2 Furious' but that doesn't make it a very good movie. I imagine you will be entertained, and it is definitely for fans of the street racing aspects of these movies but I can't really say you'll be blown away by anything in this movie.The story isn't generally the thing you focus upon in these movies but if you do genuinely care then you'll be satisfied. It's a more grounded, race driven story that is very centered around one specific thing and sticks to that thing throughout the entire movie. The ending is actually pretty decent and I like how they stitch the franchise together.It's honestly quite hard to be the worst actor in a franchise that included Vin Disel but Lucas Black steals the only thing Disel had going for him in this franchise. I get he had no professional training but then in that case he shouldn't even be there if he possesses no ability to act. Sean's backstory isn't that interesting and he possesses no traits that make him a genuinely enticing character. Nattalie Kelley was also pretty poor as Neela and her character was pretty irrelevant. Sung Kang was good as Han and is this movies main saving grace. He's cool but you don't know WHY he is cool and that is really interesting. Bow Wow was meh as Twinkie but I can see the reason he hasn't been featured in any more movies up until this point. Brian Tee was also really weak as DK and wasn't a very good villain at all either. Brian Goodman was fine as Major Boswell.From a technical standpoint, the movie is fine. The cinematography was mostly fine and the actual race sequences were handled infinitely better than in the first two. Costume design was fine but the Set Design was really cheap, lazy and not natural.The actual action in this movie is extremely weak and the set pieces are awful. I get that wasn't the primary concern of this movie but that doesn't excuse it being weak. It is more enjoyable than '2 Fast 2 Furious' but inferior to 'The Fast and the Furious'.In conclusion, this movie is fine. It is a perfectly passable, average sequel that exists for the sake of existing. It is better than it's predecessor but inferior to the original. There is some enjoyment value to be had and I do sort of recommend it but I am blown away this movie was as successful as it was.6/10Would Recommend",EthanBJones_03,2017-05-09,2017,0.117,0.674,0.209,0.9975,Positive
149,1.0,The neurons escape 2 fast,"Infumible garbage, a full-blown torture and a shame in every scene. The third part of this franchise is one of the worst movies you can suffer. Do you know those simple stories of embarrassing script that were the previous ?, because this is not even simple. There is no story, there is nothing.The thing can be tried to explain in this: a Lucas Black trying to sneak as a 17-year-old boy, gets trouble in car races. Instead of going to the jail or the juvie, he goes to Japan, where his father lives, and in their class they're all in the races, where you give him a car because he has the money, and when he breaks it, he gives him another one. There are more races and another guy who also has money left gives him wads of bills to continue trying to kill himself. His biggest rival is another kid with fantasies of greatness who, well, likes the same girl as him. All this dense and intelligent plot will settle with a race in which the winner takes the girl as a trophy. Is the same history of ""Karate Kid 2"" 20 years after (KK2 was in 1986), this time with tuned cars.And that's it, that's all. Really, there's nothing else, that's the movie. It is even surprising that you can make good the previous two.The races ?, can not be described as action scenes, are over the top of a higher level, with cars making impossible drifts thanks to a sultry CGI.What's the moral? For men: don't study, don't be smart, don't strive, don't work, life will give you everything done, money will rain from the sky, you will always be surrounded by good girls, drinking champagne for the day while playing Ludo with the baddies of your friends, and destroying $ 20000 cars up in the evenings. For women: don't study, don't be smart, don't strive, don't work, just go to the prototype man described above, you can always be the trophy with which will remain the most pouch of all; a good girl who pleases the macho men.Vomiting.",stormhawk2021,2017-07-13,2017,0.087,0.819,0.094,-0.3519,Negative
150,6.0,"It's okay, but far from great.","If it wasn't for this movie being incorporated into the franchises overall story I think I might be less enthusiastic about it. Because other than the character of Han and a few good races there's not a lot I like about Tokyo Drift. Sure it's easy to just say this movie sucks because it lacks most of are favorite characters, and I'd be hard-pressed to disagree with that. But even this movies story is kinda lame. I know people praise this movie for really giving you a feel for the culture, but I'm not a car guy so that doesn't really matter to me.What matters to me when I watch a F&F movie is great, exciting action/racing scenes and a half decent story. I know it's F&F so asking for an elaborate story is comical to say the least. But Tokyo Drifts story is really hindered by that fact that 90% of the characters are in high school. So the result is a movie that feels smaller than the ones that came before it, and with far less stakes for it's characters than the ones that come after it. All in all if you stack it up against some of the others it doesn't compare, but as a standalone movie it's alright.",joshua-c-s-1996,2018-03-03,2018,0.035,0.825,0.141,0.9755,Positive

154,8.0,Gets Better with years.,"As a child, i do remember, seeing my friends and spending the whole afternoon watching this film. Everytime. I'm in love with the franchise, but especially, i'm in love with Tokyo Drift. First of all, the soundtrack. 
One, simple word. Amazing. From the first scene to the last. Still singing ""My Life be Like Ooh Aaah"" one decade after. The ""Barracuda"" song, also. The one that spells the word ""Barracuda"". Awesome. And of course the song in the parking lot, ""Fast And Furious"". The famous one. Then, the characters. 
Characters are well written. Of course they are full of clichès. It must be. It's a fast and furious one. Nathalie Kelly looks like a dream. Lucas Black is also a great main character. Bow Wow, he makes me laugh. And Sung Kang, the one playing Han, he's the real hero. So cool. James Dean of the franchise. You can easily fall in love with every character. Even the bad guys are cool. And, last but not least. The Cars. 
Changing to one driving style to another. To let the franchise fresh. Good choice. But then. Cars are so hot in this movie. From first till last race. I'm in love with drift cars. With the red Lancer, the Slylines and of course with Han's RX7. Amazing. If own a car, or a motorbike, and you love it. Well that's the movie for you. Definitely. I'm huge a fan.

158,5.0,An Average By The Numbers Action Movie,"24 October 2006. This movie did what it was designed to do - show of fast cars and a little bit of female legs for the young men going to see this movie and make a little profit for the producers. This predictable movie without much more provided the typical thrills and melodrama that any tame male macho movie is supposed to, except for its more exotic locale - Tokyo - which is used to a degree. While the plot is mostly straight forward and the action decent, there isn't much else, except for a small attempt at avoiding a fight scene and a weak attempt to introduce Japanese culture to the American movie scene or vice versa. The chase scene that includes lots of drifting unfortunately was handled in the most obviously set up way with cars set up in patterned, artificial ways so that safety came first (while essential) really made the movie look cheap. The character development of course was flat, the relationships nothing special, the integration of Japanese culture only mild - not much new or learned here. Just a fast-paced, not even that sexy, a movie that at least held together decently. Five out of Ten Stars.",tabuno,2019-01-21,2019,0.071,0.883,0.046,-0.6427,Negative

Was this on purpose to make Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson look like better actors?First scene: a woman just offers herself up as a prize for a race between her boyfriend and our protagonist. Excuse me? ""I thought you loved me"", she says when the race is about the finish and it is close. WHAT?After that pathetic start, nothing gets better, which is really a hard thing to do. The plot is stupid, as the poorly presented ""troublemaker teen"" is sent to Japan with his father... only to remain the same and fall for a ""girl that he can't have"". That's it. That's the story. There are idiotic actions and reactions, that ends up involving Yakuzas(!) and cars, to the fact he likes a girl (and she likes him back for no reason other than he's a white American in Japan. Apparently the producers didn't realize Black is not Paul Walker), but they don't really add anything interesting.Absolutely atrocious.",educallejero,2019-03-24,2019,0.15,0.724,0.126,-0.7911,Negative
160,1.0,Watched it for the lol,"I could not possibly take this movie serious. I watched all the previous parts and pained my way through it. First there was this slightly to OLD main character Sean from high School. It started of course with a race. But the Price was this blonde Girl. She even set herself out as a Price. I mean common, I didnt´t know this franchise could go any lower in objectifying women. But here they went. The first race was really neckbraking and Sean even drove through a construction building. When the Guy and the Girl crashed - I thought they must be dead. But they only had scratches. At the Police Station, the cop said Sean would go to prison. Which I fullhearted Support! When they said he allready had a full Register with illegal car races and nothing happened to him, it made me so angry... I couldn't like the main character. I am glad the mother kicked him out. Of course, the first Thing you think of to give your son a lesson for live: Send him to Japan for correction. There he lived with his dad who tried to give him some boundarys and threatens him with consequences. Next day he already went to School. Just like that.. in Tokio.. and he doesn't speak one word japanese. The first Thing in class was of course the non-japanese love interesst in the movie. Also he met some African american bloke who oppenly tried to sell him stolen goods. I thought (or wished) it would be a film about integrity, but no - It looked so american I could only guess they filmed it in a japanese area somewhere in a bigger City in the US. I dunno Sean soon discovered he could start racing again in Japan. Although his father would kick him out as promissed. Sean didn't care. And Oh - look, of course his new Girl was the GF from his racing Opponent. And more to come: As he doesn't have a care. Some RANDOM bloke said: here take mine. Although I don't know you and your skills, please, take my expensive racing car. Of course he shattered the car in pieces... and we find out the car owner belongs to yakuza. I have to addmit I drifted of to sleep by myself very often. They had a lot of races in between, but: the never drove like.. straight through the streets. They always drifted. I got it in the parking house... but why would they do that on a straight street? Eventually someone actually died in a race. They Kind of didn't mourn or took a lesson out of it. NO! Sean got in a hassle with some yakuza Boss who surely would just shot him down, but Sean asked for forgivness by driving a race and everything would be forgotten? Stupidest Thing I have ever heard. And they did so! Another race was coming and in the end, the Opponent DK (Donky Kong I thought first) crashed horribly and could have been dead. I hoped for the movie: Sean gets a grip, Ends the race early and Looks after DK if he is alright. No, he doenst. Driving straight to the Yakuza Boss who nods and no lesson was learned that day. It taught the audience, driving riskfull, even getting People killed, is ok. There will be no punishment. Women will like you even more. You also don't have to study or work. You just get new cars.

But some of the rankings for the whole series put this in second place.The advantage Tokyo Drift has is, at its core, its a story about a boy in trouble, in a foreign place, and with little support from family.
There's not machine guns or CGI or unbelievable stunts. There's not the Rock or Vin Deisel. It's fairly realistic, and the setting in Tokyo is superb.
The main actor plays it understated, and none of the over the top charactatures we see in the other movies.

Set almost entirely in Japan, which is notorious for winding mountain roads perfect for drifting (as seen in Initial-D, which is recommended if you liked this, both the movie and the anime), this movie brings back the cars and action sorely underutilized in the second movie and spices things up with a bit of Japanese culture and swanky mid-race camera tricks.Tokyo Drift won't be winning any awards for acting; the acting here is cheesy and oftentimes teeters on bad, particularly when it comes to Neela (played by Nathalie Kelley, who switches accents from scene to scene and seems to think she's in a Disney channel show). But that's not why we're here, is it? I didn't expect a masterpiece of acting when I watched this so I won't knock the movie for it. What I will say was disappointing was the focus on American characters in Japan (for what it's worth, I am American myself). Initially, I didn't know the main character of Tokyo Drift was an American, though as the movie played out I accepted it since it's genuinely entertaining to watch an Alabama boy try to assimilate into Japanese culture. But quite a few main characters weren't Japanese, including Neela and Twinkie. For being set in Japan, I was hoping for more Japanese characters. Han was awesome and quickly rose to be my favorite character of the franchise yet. While I won't spoil anything here, the choices made for Han's character disappointed me greatly, though I have to give the film credit for actually *going* there.Overall, I found this the most entertaining film in the Fast and the Furious franchise yet. While I know the films branch out from here, I only wish for more racing/drifting films set in Japan because it's stuff like this I can't get enough of. The climax race of this film (American muscle versus Japanese drift) was an absolute thrill. More like this, please!",fewald139,2019-08-25,2019,0.058,0.781,0.16,0.9898,Positive

Love fast and furious movies,they're fun to watch, so was watching them all again, and can't help myself now but have to comment on this movie because it is sooooooooooooooo annoying thinking about the fact someone, or more than one person, actually got paid for the casting in this movie!?Nothing personal against Lucas Black, not saying he's a bad actor, but what kind of mentally challenged guy or team of people thought he was the right fit to play a 17yo troubled teen in this movie????I mean seriously?? Whoever payed anyone to do the casting for this movie, call me next time in stead to cast ur movie and I will do a million times better for free...Picking a 35year old looking guy to play a 17yo kid (with a terrible southern accent)... It blows my mind... Again, not judging Lucas Black, if someone would pay me a lot of money to play a 15yo girl in a movie once, fk it, I will do it too.But I'm a 34yo man, I am not right to play that part! I'm writing this review in the middle of watching the movie, and going to finish watching it now.But will still be so annoyed the whole movie long watching some 35yo looking dude struggling to act like a 17yo kid...Really worst casting ever, they might as well had anthony hopkins play the main charachter, would've been just as believable.",davidplees,2019-09-15,2019,0.148,0.742,0.11,-0.9243,Negative

173,3.0,Stylistically excellent; Otherwise atrocious,"I watched this 2006 movie in 2009, in advance of the fourth installment coming out. I found it extremely poor and I want to let you know why. 1. It's not a ‘The Fast and the Furious’ movie. The first two installments established the franchise as involving illegal streetracing, organized crime, and undercover law enforcement. This movie is about a high school outsider who proves himself, finds his place, and gets the girl (a plot in which streetracing is a trope and organized crime is incidental). There's nothing wrong with that kind of movie, except the title in this case. (It's like The Karate Kid but with cars. The Car-ate Kid.) In fact, it's more of a sequel to director Justin Lin's 2002 film ‘Better Luck Tomorrow’, since it at least has a character in common with that movie (Sung Kang as ‘Han’). Might as well have called it ‘Better Luck Tomorrow, White Boy.’ 2. Lucas Black is a terrible actor. Who decided to turn this guy into a lead performer? I thought his 'Bama accent, wooden expressions, and awkward approximations of feeling were laughable when he was a child star on ‘American Gothic’. As an adult with ten years of experience, he should have made some progress. Alas, he has not. When your lead is inaccessible and unlikeable, your movie tends to suffer. 3. The cinematography and style are excellent and groundbreaking. The story is cliché and clumsy. The 3/10 score I gave it is ALL for the former. 4. Ooh, he wins the big race using an American car with Japanese guts. Do I smell symbolism? Yes I do, and it smells awful.",murrayspeer,2019-11-04,2019,0.084,0.802,0.114,0.8638,Positive

175,9.0,My Favorite of the series,"I've watched all the series (except for the Hobbs spin off) and Tokyo drift is my favorite. Its like OHMSS of the Bond series, in that it fits in evolutionary point of the series where they get things just right, and there is a great balance.Lets face it, this is a divisive FandF movie. A lot of people hate it, and to many its one of the best, if not the best of the series.Tokyo drift doesn't have some of the ridiculous over the top unrealistics scenes, like cars shooting at planes, and fighting tanks or racing submarines. Some of those action sequences in the later movies are fun, but unbelievable and really take away from the tone of what is really a straight car action movie.Tokyo drift doesn;t ahve the other the top military aspects. Sure there is a Yakuza element, but ultimately, these are just people racing cars. There's no machine guns involved, no martial arts fights... its about car culture, and how that fits with people.The movie gets it just right. Justin Lin has come in and made it slicker than the first two movies, however it still relatively realistic unlike the later ones.On top of that, its set in an interesting exotic locale, and Lucas Black's character as a fish out of water character is interesting enough, as are some of the supporting characters, including Sung Kang. That said, bits of it are not authentic, and while Sonny Chiba is an icon in Japan, his English dialogue is stilted here.Overall, its the only one of hte series I watch regularly. The series could really benefit from having Lucas Black's character back involved!",info-5918,2019-12-18,2019,0.055,0.806,0.139,0.9726,Positive

178,7.0,"Stellar for a Sequel, Just OK on its own","My first exposure to this movie was the theme song aptly named 'The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift'. The movie, once viewed, lived up to the expectations I had based on the style and energy of the song. Troubled youth Sean Boswell is shipped off to Japan to avoid jail time and falls in with a group of street drift racers. He befriends the only other non-native people, Twinkie and Neela, and becomes entangled with the local mob and his school peers. There is little need for the movie to exist, but boy is it fun. It feels almost like a playground drama blown out of proportion by the participant's minds, though the death and violence do upgrade the rating above PG. It feels a bit like a 'white man saves the day' story, given that it took an American to end Takaszhi's aggression in a flashy race. That being said, the franchise does tend to feature a specific type of leading man, and this is no exception to that theme.",rachelgallit,2020-01-30,2020,0.115,0.823,0.062,-0.8883,Negative
179,8.0,Best movie of the series,Tokyo drift was something different from the other movies of the series. Having a relatively unknown star-cast devoid of any superstars actually worked in favor of this movie. There was not much technology used here for planning a robbery or saving the world like the others. This movie gave a good introduction about drift racing especially on mountains like it has been shown in various video games as well.

180,4.0,The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006),"Directed by Justin Lin. Starring Lucas Black, Sung Kang, Brian Tee, Nathalie Kelley, Shad ""Lil' Bow Wow"" Moss, Brian Goodman, Sonny Chiba, Leonardo Nam, Zachery Ty Bryan, Nikki Griffin, Lynda Boyd. (PG-13)After getting busted for racing Tim ""The Tool Man"" Taylor's kid, American teen Black is shipped off to Tokyo to live with his Naval officer father (Goodman); there he attracts the attention of a girl (Kelley) who looks like she came from Japanese High School Musical, and her flat-nosed boyfriend (Tee), whose uncle (Chiba) has powerful Yakuza ties. Third outing has little connection to the rest of the series--at least, until a little retconning was done--but offers much of the same thing one has come to expect from the franchise: sleek autos, bare mid-riffs, incessant soundtrack cues, instructions to turn off the brain, etc. Lame, barely-existent plot spends way too much time away from revving engines; of the cast, only Kang's zen calm style is worth positive notice. The drifting scenes are sometimes engaging, except when mediocre CGI and aggressive editing spoil the fun (good luck figuring out what the heck happens during the last minute or so of the climactic chase). Even though it was and still is the least successful ""The Fast and the Furious"" movie--and nearly killed the then-flimsy franchise--director Lin proved the best fit yet, and was brought back for the next three entries. (Not much of) a surprise cameo pops up at the end for those who stick around that long.37/100",fntstcplnt,2020-02-09,2020,0.055,0.796,0.149,0.9748,Positive

183,8.0,A Different Concept for Fast and Furious Series,"Tokyo Drift is a movie that brought a different concept to the Fast and the Furious Series. Previous films had ten-second speed races on the straight track. In Tokyo drift, races are not like that, the main thing is not to be fast, but to finish the race by doing good drifting on sweeping roads.It offers a different style to the audience as cars. We got used to classic American cars from previous movies. The audience also had the opportunity to watch Asian cars in this movie. There are plenty of racing scenes in the movie. It saturates the audience with races and action.The film generally focuses on Han. In the 6th film of the series, he talks about his life in Tokyo after Han decided to return to Tokyo.My favorite scene in the movie is the scene between Han and Sean on a balcony. There is a message about life here. I like that it contains messages about life in movies. The surprise at the end of the movie was nice, but I wish they didn't finish the race without showing who won.Having erotic scenes in the movie was not good in terms of the movie. I especially learned from the sex scene of two girls. I have never admitted having obscene scenes in movies.",drmuhammedsamiduru,2020-04-21,2020,0.035,0.84,0.125,0.9744,Positive

188,4.0,Uncharismatic,"The first true side story in the Fast & Furious saga. We leave behind both Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and instead focus on Sean Bowell (Lucas Black), an Arizona youngster, who gets into trouble with his reckless driving and gets sent to Japan to live with his father. There he yet again gets into trouble due to his need to go fast.And that's fine. On paper it'd be nice to explore other cultures and their takes on street racing. The story is also loosely tied to the overall saga with the introduction of Han (Sung Kang), who joins Brian and Dom in the following films as a part of their crew, becoming a beloved character.Unfortunately the plot and characters in this film - with the exception of Han - are as bland as rice paper. Sean as a character pales miserably next to the raw charisma of Walker and Diesel, and the fact that he's supposed to be a teenager doesn't exactly help things. (Black was in his mid-20s when filming this film. So almost a decade too old.)And even though the racing in the film is nice, like it's in all of the Fast & Furious films, it's not enough to save the film.Out of all the F&F films, this is the only one I'd say you can safely skip without losing pretty much anything.",Vartiainen,2020-05-08,2020,0.104,0.814,0.082,-0.7123,Negative

190,10.0,Favorite film of the franchise,"The original The Fast and The Furious was the Point Break of street racing movies. The film was so popular and well-received that it has spawned a bunch of sequels and offshoots. At this point almost 20 years later, it's kind of gotten out of hand. The franchise is now less about street racing and more about crazy superhuman stunts and world-ending subplots, basically James Bond with flying cars. It's pretty silly now. But, for my money, the first 3 movies of the franchise are ace. While the stories are pretty good, at their very core, the original trilogy of movies are about speed and the adrenaline rush of the race. And I'm probably one of the very few people on the planet whose favorite FnF movie of the franchise is this this third one THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS:TOKYO DRIFT (2006). Tokyo Drift is a simple fish out of water tale and the hero in this one is neither Brian nor Dom, but an outlier in the series high school student Sean Boswell (excellently played by Lucas Black), a troubled rebel loner who gets into trouble in the States in the film's opening sequence, as Sean takes part in a thrilling street race against the school bully (Home Improvement's Zachery Ty Bryan in a cameo role). The two boys are dueling over the bully's girlfriend and end up tearing up a bunch of property during their race. To keep Sean out of trouble, his mother ships him off to Japan to live with his estranged, stern father (well played by Brian Goodman). During his first day at his Tokyo high school, Sean struggles to fit in and is shown the ropes by fellow American Twinkie (played by rapper Bow Wow in a scene stealing performance), who hustles all kinds of products to make money. Sean also meets Neela (a stunning Nathalie Kelley), a beautiful Australian import who's lived in Tokyo since childhood. As Sean attempts to woo Neela, he meets resistance from her boyfriend DK (played with appropriate menace by Brian Tee), a local thug and nephew of the most powerful gangster in Tokyo. Sean and DK get into a race over Neela...sound familiar? They race in a high rise parking garage where DK easily schools Sean in this first encounter as Sean doesn't know how to ‘drift’ his car, a special technique that allows the driver to smoothly manipulate sharp curves while still maintaining complete control of the vehicle and stay in a race. The car that Sean damaged was owned by Han (confidently played by Sung Kang), a rich and mysterious player in Tokyo who seems to have a history as deep as his pockets. So Han decides to take Sean under his wing and have him perform special jobs for him to pay him back for the damaged car. During their joint venture, Han shares wisdom with Sean, while at the same time Twinkie helps Sean navigate the streets of Tokyo. Eventually, the trio come together as Sean, Twinkie and their crew including funny duo of non-talking side characters Earl and Reiko teach Sean how to drift so he can eventually have a final showdown with DK. Tokyo Drift is easily the most entertaining movie of the entire series telling the cliche underdog rebel story with energy, flair and humor. The cast plays well off each other. I find the Sean-Han dynamic to be just as engaging as the Dom-Brian one from the original film. And the movie never slows down. Even the heavy dialogue scenes are good. The scenic, eye-popping Tokyo setting is a welcome contrast to the more grungy American locales of the first 2 movies. Tokyo Drift is an anomaly where the 3rd film in a series may actual be the best of the lot.",hnt_dnl,2020-05-29,2020,0.062,0.734,0.204,0.9988,Positive

195,8.0,The fast and the furious Tokyo drift,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) in my opinion I think is a solid good action sequel, a very bashed and hated in the series. Which I don't think this movie is bad, I think is a much better movie than Furious 7. I always loved this movie, I think it is a good movie, but in the series is not the worst one, but is far from worst one that would be Furious 7. I think it was a different solid, good sequel in the series and I love it for an action film. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a fun movie to watch: it accomplishes what it set out to do and that's provide the most realistic yet gravity-defying racing sequences, backed with the eye-catching background of the electrifying, neon Tokyo. Plot-wise it suffers a bit and the acting isn't top-notch, otherwise the loud music, import cars, cityscape Tokyo, and Japanese pop culture more than make up for the flaws of the film that you'll watch it again and again.Plot: When convicted street racer Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) tries to start a new life on the other side of the world, his obsession with racing sets him on a collision course with the Japanese underworld. To survive, he will have to master drifting-a new style of racing where tricked-out cars slide through hairpin turns, defying gravity and death for the ultimate road rush.This movie is more the highest-octane installment of the hit movie franchise built for speed!

This is a very simple film, not a big confusing plot and again this films, you know 5,6 and 7 the plots are still pretty simplistic.5 was a heist movie, 6 was this guy the evil version of you, we want him to bring him down simple.7 you killed this guy's brother, he is looking for revenge and he also try's to kill you so you get this, simple movie not complicate at all. That is one thing that this movies get right constantly.The racing in this movie: I think they did a better job than in 2, because I didn't noticed more of a CGI, because that's how they just do it now, a lot of wide shot you can tell there was a lot of practical stunt drive, it look good which I enjoyed that. I know a lot of people will put this movie lover down and I think it is a solid movie and a solid flick. This is the first time Brian Tyler made the score and this is also the first one that Justin Lin directed, he went later directing three next movies 4,5 and 6 which I love to death. I thought the direction is good, I like the resolves on the end of the movie, the sound track is good, I did not mind the cast you know. Lucas Black is the lead in this movie. Sonny Chiba is in this movie I always like the actor. This was Sung Kang's first introduction of his character Han who later appeared in 4 as a cameo, than in 5 and 6 as regular cast. Vin Diesel did returned with his character Dominic Toretto, who made a cameo scene on the end of the movie, which I thought was pretty cool. Bow Wow I didn't mind him in this movie and Nathalie Kelley was extremely hot and I really though she was much better sexy babe, than Eva Mendes was in 2 Fast 2 Furious. Nathalie Kelley lights up the screen as Neela and I would welcome her return to the series any time.Overall: Tokyo Drift gets a solid 8 by me it does lacks on the great characters and the cast of the first two movies in the series, but is redeemed by Han, awesome car scenes and a pounding score from Brian Tyler.

196,6.0,Better than F2!,"Without any of the original cast members I wondered how this installment would play out. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it more than '2 Fast 2 Furious'.The premise and the characters were much better than it's predecessor. This standalone sequel had lots more action than F2, and the action sequences are stunning! I cared more about the characters, and thought the actors did them justice with good acting. With the lack of comic relief that was just too much in F2, this was more serious and therefore more suspenseful.The events leading to the finale was well set-up as it built to a climax. By that time we knew the characters, and there's been great character development - especially from the lead, Sean (played by Lucas Black). Off course the stunning cars are back - more impressive than F2, and the film has a great rocking soundtrack for most part. The stunts are jaw-dropping.The finale was a thrilling, fast-paced visual spectacle. The film has a highly effective score - especially during the finale. Everything about this film was better than F2. Wow, this was incredible. I loved it! This is a darn good action film!",paulclaassen,2020-07-23,2020,0.016,0.7,0.283,0.9962,Positive

198,3.0,Throw off the timeline,"Justin Lin comes into the franchise here and, well, he has none of the original cast members coming back. So what do you do? Concentrate on the cars. Also, the chronological history of the story would change from here on out, with installments until 2015's Furious 7 being set between 2 Fast 2 Furious and this movie. Yes, you'd be shocked how confusing - and deep - these movies go. I watched all of them within a day or two, so I'm still amazed how we go from street gangs to the family basically being the G.I. Joe team. High school student Sean Boswell keeps getting arrested for street racing, so he is sent to live in Japan with his father. There, he discovers, well, street racing. Are you surprised? There he meets Twinkie (Bow Wow), who gets him in and he starts doing that Tokyo Drift, as they say. Sung Kang, who plays Han Lue, originated that role in Lin's movie Better Luck Tomorrow. He'd return in Fast & Furious, Fast Five, Fast & Furious 6 and Furious 7, as well as the short film Los Bandoleros, all set between the events of Better Luck Tomorrow and this movie. Han's explosive car crash was revisited in post-credits scene of Fast & Furious 6, which introduced Jason Statham's Deckard Shaw. Boswell would return in Furious 7, while he, Kang and Twinkie will all be back for F9. How is Kang still alive? We'll see. Following poor test screenings, Vin Diesel agreed to make a cameo as Dom in exchange for Universal's ownership to the rights of the Riddick series and character. No money exchanged hands. I'm always amazed at how canny Diesel is. This allowed him to make 2013's Riddick as an independent film. Also, of course Dom won in the race against Boswell.

It is good to see new faces , seeing all the same ones except Paul's while he was still here is annoying and boring, especially one of vin diesel. I thought actors were pretty good, at least main ones were really into their role , DK didn't even have to say anything he looked mean enough. Han he was sort of cool guy just sitting in background, and Sean was really into his role of learning how to drift. Neela is really pretty, prettier than other girls from the series.

205,6.0,A side story,"This review contains spoilers. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is the third installment in The Fast and the Furious franchise. It is a movie that stars a new cast of characters that engage in drift racing rather than the previous two movies' conventional racing. The movie follows Sean Boswell, played by Lucas Black, that is exiled to Japan following a street race that lands him in jail. Sean shortly after meets Han, played by Sung Kang, who teaches him drifting and the two form a friendship. Surprisingly, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift has a coherent story. This is a welcome change from 2 Fast 2 Furious' incoherent story. The movie follows Sean and the audience can see his journey as he tries to make things right with Han and his own father. The story and the characters are the good parts of this movie as I was engaged to find out more about Han and the drifting culture. The downside is the villains are not intimidating. I did not find them engaging and it felt that it was only a matter of time until they were overcome. The cast of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are not present as main cast members in this movie. This can be a disappointment to fans of the previous two movies as the two actors can be charismatic in their roles. This movie did feel less like the previous movies and more of a side story. The movie felt plausible in its execution of stunts and for this the movie can be enjoyed as a side story set in the same universe as the previous movies. The story keeps up the light-hearted fun of the first two movies but can delve into interesting plot turns. Han is a great character and I enjoyed every scene that he was in. I would recommend The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. Although the movie is not perfect, the movie is a complete stand-alone movie in The Fast and the Furious universe.

As far as the races themselves go, I think the opening race (which these early Fast & Furious films had quite frequently, for those who don't know) is probably my favorite in the franchise, at least that I've seen. I'm not a super big fan of the main character (I'm terrible with names), I feel like he was not cast right and I think he was a very badly written character. In fact I'm not really fond of these characters in general. I felt like they were quite forgettable and, well, bland.If you're in the mood for a fun car flick and insane stunts, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is the film for you.",Z21708,2021-01-09,2021,0.177,0.688,0.136,-0.9052,Negative

The street races in particular are pretty good and is what I would consider to be Tokyo Drift's most redeeming quality. It is also the film from the Fast and Furious franchise that doesn't feel the need for viewers to have seen the other FF films to understand what's going on.In short, dumb but fun.",CasuallViewer,2021-02-13,2021,0.096,0.713,0.191,0.9428,Positive

This movie takes place in Japan and shows lots of cars especially from Japan such as the Nissan 350Z, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IX, Mazda RX-8, and many more Japan cars. This movie not only talks about Japan cars, but also talks about the Japan life such as the Tokyo's underground street racing, Japan night life, the school life in Japan, and Yakuza. Different from other fast and furious movie which shows about a heist movie with pretty cars, Tokyo Drift is made for car enthusiasts. What I like about this movie is how Japan people spends lot of time and money for their cars and do races with the cars they build. This Japan cars is mostly known as JDM cars which lots of car enthusiasts love them. The races the do in this movie is very intense and interesting to watch. In conclusion, this movie is made for car enthusiasts from all around the world who love cars very much, especially JDM cars. I highly recommend this movie because I love cars so much !

That is exactly what this movie did. I really liked the how they kept the street racing aspect, but put a spin on it. The drifting was really cool, and the final race was arguably the best ending to any Fast and Furious movie at the time (It definitely wasn't after the later films came out). They probably should have brought back the original crew in this movie instead of waiting till the fourth installment, but just like 2 Fast 2 Furious, it ended up working out. I also really liked how this movie takes place after Fast and Furious 4, 5, and 6. I am so happy they did that and if you watched this movie, you know why.Don't listen to the critics, this was a good movie if you can get past the shaky plot, and decent acting, I recommend this for you. The movie did make up for that with great directing from Justin Lin who came back for Fast 4, 5, and 6, and some very likable characters like Han (Who is the only person besides a cameo from Sean in Furious 7 to come back).

Rather than a charming southern boy trying to find his way in Japan, Sean comes across as a creepy man-child too arrogant to respect those around him.I would only rewatch this film for one of two reasons: 1) To watch the epic drift race down the mountain (if only we could cut out the horrible, flip-phone huddled reactions) and 2) Han (easily one of the best characters in the entire F&F franchise).

I'm sorry but this part was woefully miscast. Lucas Black did not work in this role at all. To offer some defence, the part was bland and the character awfully written, so he had little to work with, but in any case he was not the man for the job.The story is weak. There are some decent racing sequences but aside from Han the characters are such a chore.Ultimately this film suffered from being too detached from the main franchise. I think I benefited from watching it after having seen the later instalments with Han in, so it was nice seeing his origins.

268,7.0,great cars great movie,"From the fast and the furious series, this film is one of the closest to its subject. The cast in the film, of course, does not reach the Oscar level, but not the worst either. The main character is not as charismatic and pleasant as Paul Walker, and the secondary characters, with the exception of Khan, are not as interesting as in the first two afterburners. It is quite possible to believe in the worldview and thinking of the characters. As for the plot, it looks quite logical and correct, but a little far-fetched. The combination of the mafia with street racing looks interesting, but at the same time a little strange, while watching, in principle, you don't think about it. Subplots such as the development of Lucas Black's character and Natalie Kelly's relationship are clichéd and simple. The cast in this fast and the furious film is new and it was a little unusual not to see the old people, and it's even a pity that they weren't there or they didn't participate in the film in any way. I think the fans would love that. As for the main icing on the cake for people watching this series of films, which is racing and cars, Justin Lin - the director of this film did an excellent job with this task. We see great tuned cars, and some of them are quite rare. It can be seen that they were not at all sorry for the moment with the breaking of one of the 350z, which makes us, the fans, very happy. Races are built in such a way that, from the point of view of logic and the most beneficial behavior of cars on the road, if you think about it, it's ridiculous. But despite all this, the action and beauty of drifting give you a great reason to close your eyes and just relax. And drifting in this film is the main driving technique. The film has some action, it's not hard to understand, it's a pleasure to watch because of the large number of cool and fancy cars that we never or very rarely see on our roads. He was created in order to lie down on his favorite sofa after a hard day, without loading his brain and enjoy what is happening in this film, which, in principle, he easily coped with as he should.",batyrkhanmanov,2022-09-07,2022,0.044,0.788,0.168,0.9966,Positive

The only problem I had was the predictability and simplicity of the story: an American teenager takes risks in the streets of Tokyo with bad-ass gangsters against him but eventually he emerges at the top. The movie could use a little bit of plot twists. The stunts were crisp-perfect and the camera work was absolutely amazing.

270,7.0,Surprisingly Stellar Entry,"After the far-fetched yet successful second entry to this franchise, I don't think anyone was knowing what to expect from an entry that did not contain any of the original cast and would be taking the franchise in a slightly different direction. Directed by Justin Lin and written by Chris Morgan, Tokyo Drift follows a character named Sean, who is sent to Tokyo to live with his dad after he causes too much trouble while racing a snobby kid from his school. Not wanting to follow the rules that his father has set for him, he races in a drift race after his very first day of school, losing but befriending a group of racers who take them under their wing, particularly a character named Han. However, this also puts him at odds with the son of a mafia leader, whose girlfriend he falls for, named Neela. Naturally, this all leads to them having to race each other to prove who's better. While Tokyo Drift won't be winning the franchise any points for originality, it's still manages to stand out amongst the rest of the Fast and Furious films. Lin brings a lot more emotional depth to this film than the two previous installments, which is helped by Morgan's more down to earth portrayal of the characters. There's a lot more character development here, and a lot more dramatic weight to the plot than it just being a racing or action film. I also really like Lin's directorial approach. He focuses a lot more on the characters rather than the cars, and while the racing is still essential to the story, it's not the main highlight. Also, the father and son story line with Sean and his dad is a nice change of pace for a franchise like this. With that said, it's not perfect. Some of the character development really does fall into the cliché, particularly with the character of Neela. Her damsel in distress storyline really does feel out of place in a franchise where the female characters have been generally portrayed as very strong in will and mind. The acting is the biggest positive for this film and highlights the main strength in handing this franchise over to Justin Lin. He really pushes the actors to deliver great performances throughout the entire movie. Lucas Black, Bow Wow, Brian Tee and Sung Kang are all really good in this. The only real negative aspect to the acting comes from Nathalie Kelly. However, in fairness, I think it's far less to do with her acting ability, than the way the character is written in general, because as I stated earlier, the character is very out of place. So overall, this movie surprised me a little when I first saw it and continues to surprise me when compared to the rest of the franchise, outside of maybe the first movie. While the story is not original, it has a heart to it that really helps it along the way.",Ggconte,2022-11-14,2022,0.057,0.824,0.118,0.9897,Positive
271,8.0,Tokyo Racing,"The ""Fast and Furious"" dilogy in the early 2000s became a kind of canon for fans to see cool pumped cars with bright neon lighting. Drive, powerful soundtrack, interesting story - all this was present in the films with Paul Walker. And it was surprisingly unusual to realize that the third part would focus on completely different characters, and even on the other side of the Earth. At first, I observed myself a certain rejection in this regard to this project. However, after just a couple of dozen minutes, the plot is addictive, and the picture is fun to watch.""Tokyo Drift"" undertakes to tell about the nightlife of the capital of Japan, where the main character arrives. And even if he is still a high school student, the guy joins the nightlife of the metropolis, where there is also an underground world of beautiful tuned cars. The picture, however, focuses not on speeds, as it was in previous paintings, but on drifting, when craftsmen manage to drive not only fast on small sites, but also fit into turns, sending their cars into a controlled skid. It was a fresh trend of the film, it was shown in an interesting and tasteful way. However, this does not mean that nothing has been prepared here for fans of racing through the dark streets of the city. Such things are necessarily in store from the creators, and the tricks are performed at the proper level.The screenwriters did not invent something extraordinary in terms of the plot, habitually placing the protagonist in new living conditions for him, where he will have to make his way to the very top, be sure to get a powerful opponent and of course get a passion. The film is unlikely to present any surprises in the course of the plot, but in general the picture looks very cheerful, not allowing the viewer to lose interest in what is happening on the screen. The film catches, probably, in another way: a good video next to it and an ultramodern soundtrack that successfully fits into the corresponding scenes.The work of the whole team is impressive. On the screen we see the actors, their vicissitudes, but much in the film depended on the stuntmen and stunt directors. The guys did a great job, giving a really driving action for all fans of this genre.""Tokyo Drift"" turned out to be a good ""Fast and Furious"". Other, unusual - this is a fact. But after a couple of films in the series, viewers will realize that this is quite an interesting part of the overall franchise, and this picture has only expanded the edges of a huge world with a lot of heroes and villains for us. And they did it quite worthily.8 out of 10.",alekspredator87,2022-12-13,2022,0.043,0.798,0.159,0.9959,Positive
272,7.0,It's either you like it or hate it.,"Despite its flaws, I'm still enjoyed Tokyo Drift to this day and it is still one of my personal favourites from this franchise. This movie felt like it rather take it easy and simple, but sometimes, simplicity worked better than being convoluted most of the time. The action sequences are a lot better than before, especially the last race segment. There's fair share amount of hot babes, if that's one of the the things you expect from this movie, and the score are probably the best in the franchise, in my opinion. Some of the characters are one-dimensional and stereotypical though, especially the MC, the script is predictable and felt familiar at times, and the fact that this sequel is almost completely different from the other entries might throw people off.",rimuruu,2023-01-15,2023,0.0,0.831,0.169,0.9753,Positive
273,2.0,Truly shocking to watch,"As an expat living in Japan, I had resisted watching Tokyo drift as long as possible due to the overwhelmingly bad reputation the movie has. Despite which, I can say with sheer confidence that the last 17 years have done nothing to improve this film. The plot is both non existent and extremely pandering to some sort of American feverdream about what Japan is (spoiler, Japan is nothing like this). It only takes a few minutes of scrolling through the IMDB page to realise that none of the main actors are Japanese and the majority of the filming was done in LA. Threadbare plot and complete lack of cultural understanding aside, nothing is as unforgivable as the main actor who can barely read his English language lines off the page, not to mention Japanese -- though to be fair, no one seems to be able to speak Japanese in this film (Was there even a language coach onsite?). Long story short, if you want to see an adult man masquerading as a teenager in essentially a rehash of the worst tropes of the other F&F films, you're in the right place. Shoutout to all the other incredible reviewers down here in the 1-3 star range, I experienced a wider range of emotions reading these reviews than watching the entirety of the movie.",megandbeale,2023-01-31,2023,0.076,0.894,0.029,-0.8811,Negative

Many of the other ""kids"" also looked way too old for their roles.The plot and story-line are weak, characters shallow and unsuited to their roles.

K. is a very convincing bad guy, he was great, and just like the previous movie, Tokyo Drift also fills with great badass exciting loud action sequence, great music, and the story in this one is so far the purest race car story in the franchise, added with a strong friendship elements in it, overall Tokyo Drift was another banger for me!",HabibieHakim123,2023-03-16,2023,0.06,0.7,0.24,0.9803,Positive

From the first second the music hits differently and then the racing immediately shows this is already way better than the 2nd part. It has conviction and heart to it that even some of the wacky themes, acting etc can be overlooked. It really makes no sense why the main character and everyone around him act as they do and why that actor was even chosen to be a 17-year-old when he doesn't even look young enough to be his actual age at the time. But the music and the races, the focus given on the drifting etc sweeps away everything else for the viewer. It's also wild that the character of Han and the director Justin Lin turned out to be kind of central figures in the future of the franchise.

281,3.0,Sore Thumb of the Franchise,One of the worst acted movies that's not considered a children's movie that I've ever scene. The lead actor looks like it's his first time in front of a camera and the story is equally as bad. It's unclear what the problem to be solved in the story even is. It's clear they wanted to make a feud between Boswell and DK but weren't sure how to do that so they just concocted some story about Han taking money on the side. In the other Fast and Furious movies there is at least reason for the car chases. For this movie all they want to do is show you car chases and in order to do so they make up a feeble story in order to show you endless drifting. Clearly they are hoping that the viewer is just mesmerized by the drifting otherwise I can't see what there is to enjoy otherwise. Even the love interest between Boswell and Neela is awkward. You re told pieces of her story but in the end she's only used seemingly to be a piece to be gifted to the winner of the races. No doubt a demeaning role.The only role this movie serves is to give you some more time with Han and it at least fits with the ending of Fast 6.,ThereelscoopwithKK,2023-05-10,2023,0.085,0.777,0.138,0.9495,Positive

Last but not least, the violent and shocking death of one of the film's characters, as well as the warning message at the beginning of the end credits, concerning the professional qualities and the strict safety standards necessary to make the film, remind us that driving in the public space must never be a mindless act disrespectful of the highway code, which protects our health and our life.",OMTR,2023-05-10,2023,0.098,0.748,0.154,0.7862,Positive

285,6.0,Some things work and some clearly don't,"Tokyo Drift was a great idea to do a film in a different country with a unique spin to it. The setting was great, the storyline was not bad and it had some good energy behind it. It also a nice departure from the main characters that drive the Fast and Furious franchise. A series could get stagnant after seeing the same people. Injecting some new blood and story adds flair and broadens the franchise.Tokyo Drift reminded me how important the main character is to carry the film. This is where things fall short. Lucas Black, the lead of this film, is a poor lead. From this terrible accent that is not believable to his subpar acting and mannerisms. He lacks appeal, charisma and is quite dull to watch. He is given poor support from Nathalie Kelley, the romantic interest who is dull and not interesting at all. Their on screen chemistry was weak. Brian Tee made a good villain but this was to no avail as the two main cast members do not carry this film. You end up having a somewhat lackluster film in the end. 6/10.",Kingslaay,2023-05-27,2023,0.101,0.797,0.102,-0.2054,Negative
286,6.0,"Beautiful Tokyo setting, and awesome racing!","Review: As with the second movie, this movie is more of a stand-alone feature, and not a direct follow-up to the Fast and The Furious 2001. However the story is good as are the two leads in this movie. The script could have used work though. Takeaways: -Director justin Lin does a good job with the visuals and the action and racing scenes. No wonder the Fast producers asked him to come back to direct the sequels. -Lucas black was believable as trouble young street racer Sean, who is sent to live with his navy father in Tokyo by his mother to stay out of trouble. He befriends Street Racer/gangster Han Lue, who teaches him how to drift. I like this character, but he is a hot-head. -Later on Lucas Black would star in 6 seasons of NCIS New Orleans as Agent Chris Lasalle. -Sung Kang was great as Han Lue. I love how this drifter is edgy yet kind. We didn't know that So much hurt happened to him before this (explored in the other fast movies when he lost his girlfriend) -Bow Wow (Aka Shad Moss) plays Sean's friend and sidekick as they race against the gangsters in the end. -The Cars are beautiful and of course the racing was intense. -Hey was that Brad Taylor (Zach Tyler Bryan) for home improvement? -The script could have been a little better. Some scenes and dialogue I just cringed at. -I loved the ending scene with.... VIN DIESEL!!!! DOM TORRETTO IS BACK!!! WHOOOO!!! Also be sure to watch Furious 7 after this because it shows a lot more of Han's death and that a man who wanted revenge was responsible.",myblueblazer,2023-05-28,2023,0.09,0.736,0.174,0.9853,Positive
287,7.0,Fast and The Furious goes back to high school and to Tokyo.,"This is the third installment in the Fast and The Furious franchise and it takes the story back to high school where a teenager named Sean Boswell seems to have gasoline in his veins but might be a little light on the brains as he keeps challenging people to race...even with a car that isn't his, in a country he doesn't know. Sean is a Navy brat whose mom has had to move around because of his street racing and getting into trouble. After a massive crash in a new development he is given a choice, either go live with his dad in Tokyo or go to juvie.That is how we end up in Tokyo and how Sean ends up learning how to drift when he locks horns with a Yakuza mob boss' nephew. He meets and makes friends with a little hustler named Twinkie and gets on the good side of Han who becomes his mentor. We find out later thanks to a cameo by Dom himself that Han and Dom used to run together...otherwise there is no real connection to the first two films.Definitely better than the second film, there are lots of great race scenes with some pretty good street racing stunts performed by their stunt drivers. Lots of drool worthy cars for the gear heads out there and done of the shortest skirts I have ever seen inname life.Great action entry in the series with a better story than the second film (and better race scenes), but still not as good as the original film.",cgvsluis,2023-05-29,2023,0.051,0.798,0.151,0.9867,Positive

289,6.0,Roppongi Vice.,"Honestly, I think this is the only film in the F&F series that I hadn't seen prior to this little burst of rewatches I've been doing around ""Fast X"". I wasn't looking forward to it, as it's the lowest rated film in the series, but I found it to be pretty watchable stuff.Having been involved in an accident whilst racing, Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) is sent to live with his father (Brian Goodman) in Tokyo. He struggles to fit in but makes a friend in fellow American Twinkie (Bow Wow) who introduces him to the local street racing scene. The enigmatic Han (Sung Kang) offers Sean the chance to drive his car but, unfamiliar with the drifting technique, he crashes it. Indebted to Han, Sean starts to work off his obligation, but Han's friends, particularly Takashi (Brian Tee) who has Yakuza connections, take a strong dislike to him.So, whilst 'good' is still probably a step or two beyond it, I did, as I say, find the film the be pretty watchable stuff. It's again even more low key than the original film, let alone the way the many sequels have gone. Though there's a tangential link to the Yakuza there isn't even really that much crime in this film, (ignoring the one murder for a moment) it is literally just about street racing and for not much more than pride and status. Black is alright in the lead role, but there's definitely a reason that Han would be the character to recur more often in the series going forward, even though it would require not one, but two retcon's of his death for it to really make sense (such as it does). The film also has the legendary Sonny Chiba appear as Takashi's Yakuza uncle.Even though it's missing the sorts of stunts that the series is now famous for I didn't mind my time with Tokyo Drift and whilst I can't imagine rushing back to it again anytime soon, It was a reasonable time.",southdavid,2023-06-09,2023,0.104,0.772,0.124,0.8038,Positive
290,6.0,One of the better movies of the franchise,"When it first came out, I was in fourth grade and knew nothing about street racing or cars in general. But my evolving fascination with automobiles led me to this franchise, and specifically to this third installment of the series. The sleek cars and high-speed chases intrigued me, and it opened up a whole new world.Yes, you heard it right. Tokyo Drift was the first Fast & Furious movie I saw on television, thanks to a DVD disc I randomly came across.Seventeen long years have passed, and my perceptions of the series as well as cinema as a whole have changed considerably, but upon revisiting, I realised I still adore this movie, primarily because it stayed true to the central theme, which was racing. Unlike other movies in this series, where varied storylines frequently come to the fore, things have been kept fairly simple here.The fact that they prioritised ""Racing"" over everything else was something I really liked, despite the film's own share of problems. Therefore, it has always been one of the better entries in the F&F franchise for me.",SoumikBanerjee1996,2023-06-09,2023,0.041,0.815,0.144,0.9705,Positive

It was also cool how it was eventually made to be tied in with other films in the franchise. The main character had a pretty decent origin and while it is far fetched that he would be sent to Japan after he committed a big crime in the U. S., I thought it was a good and unique spin on things. The chases and races were really well directed and choreographed too!

But no, we have to deal with the Fast X and I'd rather watch Transformers honestly. This is a great movie compared to most of the Fast movies. Vin diesel killed the Fast franchise.

294,9.0,A different world,"""Fast & Furious 3: Tokyo Drift"", the third installment in the franchise, shines brightly with its unique approach to the series. The film takes a daring leap by shifting its setting to Tokyo and introducing a new protagonist, Sean Boswell, portrayed by Lucas Black. This change of pace infuses the series with a fresh burst of energy, showcasing the fusion of American car culture with Japanese drifting techniques.The movie's greatest strength lies in its breathtaking racing sequences. The art of drifting takes center stage, transforming car chases into mesmerizing dances of controlled chaos. Director Justin Lin's keen eye for dynamic camerawork captures the essence of these moments, allowing viewers to feel the adrenaline rush as they immerse themselves in the high-speed world of Tokyo street racing.Tokyo itself becomes a character, with its neon-lit streets and pulsating nightlife forming a vivid backdrop for the story. The film's ability to transport audiences to a completely different culture while maintaining the essence of the series is commendable. The music, a mix of hip-hop and electronic beats, complements the fast-paced visuals perfectly, elevating the overall experience.However, amidst these positives, some aspects falter. The absence of series regulars like Vin Diesel and Paul Walker is noticeable and their absence creates a void that even Tokyo's vibrant energy struggles to fill. Lucas Black's portrayal of Sean lacks the charisma and depth of his predecessors, which sometimes makes it difficult to fully invest in his journey.In conclusion, ""Fast & Furious 3: Tokyo Drift"" stands as a bold departure from the franchise's formula, exploring new territories and introducing viewers to a different facet of the car culture. Its stunning racing scenes, immersive setting, and eclectic soundtrack make it a standout entry. Yet, the absence of familiar faces and a slightly weaker lead performance are notable drawbacks. Despite these minor shortcomings, the film successfully rejuvenates the series and remains a memorable chapter for fans and newcomers alike.",uhudsavascisi,2023-08-17,2023,0.059,0.796,0.145,0.9814,Positive
295,7.0,"Exactly what's expected to be a ""car drifter""","(2006)The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift
ACTION DRAMAIn order to appreciate this film, one must first like to see street racing films and alter his/her mind to not affiliate it with other ""Fast & The Furious"" films because none of the main stars are from anyone from the previous films but can be made entertaining as a film as it's own film! Story centers on rowdy American teenager whose known to drag race and always gets himself in trouble with the law but is the final straw, and he gets sent to Tokyo to live with his father to finish his schooling. Soon after he gets mixed up with another Japanese teenager whose associated with the Yakuza, Japan's equivalent of the mafia, with at the same time build rapport with another Asian person called Nam who also is attached to racing as well! The racing is not like the other races he's done on America but is introduced to 'race drifting' where the driver is driving around narrow roads and passageways like a tall building parking garage! Director Justin Lin must've seen a lot of Asian racing films such as ""Full Thottle"", ""The Legend of Speed"" and Jackie Chan's ""Thunderbolt"" to name a few where the acting is not so great but the racing scenes are the main focus and not so much on acting or story! Also interesting is that the film allows the actors to use their natural accents for there's an actress who has an Australian accent, natural Southern American accent and of course Japanese and Korean! There's some good one-liners and beautiful scenic buildings of downtown Tokyo, where the lights look great upon the reflections on the cars, and the techno pop soundtrack all works well with this film except that in terms of car crashes done on this film- it consists of stuff we had already seen before or done on previous films made before it, with the only difference that they're done on Tokyo and done on those specific models which there is nothing wrong with that too.",jordondave-28085,2023-09-24,2023,0.049,0.835,0.116,0.9807,Positive

The story focuses on clandestine races, skirmishes with the mafiosi on duty and the inevitable love story between the protagonist and the beauty of the group. The result of a simple frame for spectacular drifting rides. The budget of the film, which however turns out to be quite high, has therefore served mainly for three things: special effects, luxury cars and to pay a small cameo by Vin Diesel.

298,10.0,Drift into Excellence: The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006),"""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" isn't just a movie; it's a heart-pounding symphony of speed, style, and storytelling that earns every bit of its perfect score. Directed by Justin Lin, this installment in the iconic franchise not only revs up the excitement but also takes the series to new, thrilling heights. From the neon-drenched streets of Tokyo to the jaw-dropping drift races, this film is a cinematic masterpiece that hits all the right notes.What sets this film apart is its ability to reinvent the franchise while staying true to its roots. The introduction of a new protagonist, Sean Boswell (Lucas Black), brings a fresh perspective to the series, and his journey from outsider to drift king is both compelling and relatable. But it's not just Sean who steals the show; it's the enigmatic and effortlessly cool Han (Sung Kang) who becomes the film's standout character. Han's calm demeanor, sharp wit, and exceptional driving skills make him an instant favorite, adding depth and charm to the movie.The film's greatest strength lies in its mesmerizing depiction of the art of drifting. The drift races are not just action sequences; they are beautifully choreographed ballets of speed and precision. The camera captures every twist and turn with elegance, immersing the audience in the exhilarating world of Tokyo's underground racing scene. The attention to detail in showcasing the cultural nuances of Tokyo adds authenticity to the film, making the city itself a character in this high-octane tale.The character development in ""Tokyo Drift"" is superb, allowing the audience to form genuine connections with the characters. Sean's evolution from a fish out of water to a skilled racer is inspiring, and his relationships with other characters are nuanced and heartfelt. The camaraderie between Sean and Han is particularly noteworthy, creating an emotional anchor that resonates throughout the film.Director Justin Lin's vision is brought to life with breathtaking visuals and expertly crafted action sequences. The film's editing is sharp and dynamic, enhancing the intensity of the races and the emotional impact of the story.

Lucas Black's performance was okay, but he was too old to be a high school student under eighteen, D. K.

The movie starts with an average car race that starts with a trivial reason, and then moves on to the drift-filled nights of Tokyo.

The beauty of this movie is that you could also see it without watching the saga, although you would not understand the ending, which I really liked and has a crazy soundtrack. In my opinion the film really comes to life in its second part, the first is a bit more boring, the second is spectacular. Even here the characters are introduced very well: the best for me is Han, simple but essential, with a great interpretation of Sung Kang. I also liked D. K. with a great interpretation of Brian Tee and Twinkie of Bow Bow. One character that I never fully appreciated in all the visions of this film is Neela, she never gave me anything. The protagonist Sean has convinced me a lot and I can't wait to see him with Brian and Dom. The direction of Justin Lin in my opinion exceeds that of the first two chapters with many spectacular shots and has organized the film very well. In my opinion this is (compared to the first two films) the one with the best car races. I also liked the photography a lot. The most beautiful thing about this film are the soundtracks, unforgettable and perfect for the fantastic Tokyo setting. In my opinion this film, like the whole saga, is too underrated, these films are bombs and if they are seen to have fun and see the beautiful action scenes are masterpieces, stop. I never get tired of this movie, even if I've seen it five times..

309,5.0,Solid entry to the franchise,"This one is tough for me to rate because it has some interesting ideas in it, but not all of it works for me. Unfortunately I don't like Lucas Black as Sean Boswell especially his accent was really annoying me. The whole story of the American highschool kid getting tangled up with the Japanese mafia also isn't 100% believable. What saves this for me is the racing aspect of this movie. The actual racing sequences and seeing the whole training that goes into becoming a good racer was really enjoyable. The stand out character here is Han who really made his case here for being brought back for later movies of this franchise as they eventually did. Overall I can neither love nor hat this movie, but it does enough to have a fun time watching.",tk_ew,2024-05-30,2024,0.099,0.809,0.092,-0.0302,Neutral
310,7.0,watch it again in 2024 !,"Watched tokyo drift for the second time after 18 yrs
yup i enjoyed it ..even more
i ithink its one of the best of the fast and furious series .. FF 1 , FF 2 and tokyo drift the other in the series just too many gimmickIn tokyo drift they have:
no CGI
normal car with a good modification....
normal person as a driver not a secret agent man or super soldier...
no such thing as a ""family""
more believable story than the other in the series , no car vs tanks, no car vs submarine , no car going to outerspace just car vs car
so please make FF series like this ..about race + nice car and speed.................",tio-01602,2024-06-03,2024,0.097,0.684,0.22,0.9672,Positive
311,5.0,Karate Kid on wheels,"It's the exact same story as The Karate Kid only it takes places on wheels.. In Tokyo. Think about it.. New kid moves into town, gets defeated by the ‘villain’ early on, starts training, gets his revenge and wins the girl in the end.. Han may not have served as a mentor the same way Mr. Miyagi did but it's obvious where they got their inspiration from. Some people claim it's the weakest movie in the series while other claim it's their favorite. Personally I think it's one of the weaker ones but the standards are not particularly high to be fair. You watch these movies for the thrills and the hot woman, not for the ‘deep’ story, or lack thereof. This is the least action packed movie in the series and action is pretty much all this series has to offer. The Vin Diesel cameo was cool but that's the only thing positive I have to say about it.",askeland89,2024-06-07,2024,0.081,0.766,0.153,0.9413,Positive
312,5.0,"Finally, a Fast & Furious for the weaboos!","The third chapter in the original Fast & Furious trilogy is the last car-centric film in the franchise, this time focusing on the car culture of Tokyo. It succeeds in being a love letter to the city, but changes the formula for the franchise too much in ways that don't work.An attempt at returning to the Teensploitation type tone, Tokyo Drift feels like a stand-alone film but is actually a monkey wrench in the Fast & Furious timeline. Han is easily the best character and is the only one to join the family in other entries in the series. The other characters are straightforward stereotypes without the cheesy charm of past leads like Diesel and Walker..",mediatation,2024-06-16,2024,0.074,0.751,0.176,0.9226,Positive
313,5.0,The Flat and the Furious.,"My journey through the Fast and the Furious series has brought me to the third film, Tokyo Drift, which - alongside Fast Five - was one of the only movies in this series I'd seen some years ago. I remembered basically nothing about the film, and rewatching it, I can see why. It's a bit of a snooze, even though there are moments that are kind of fun here and there. I think it has a good final act... actually, that's where most of the fun stuff is. It opens with a stupid, over-the-top race, and then meanders for about an hour or so, all before finally delivering some decent action in the last half-hour.I'd say it's better than the first movie, and I genuinely wonder whether I'll get to the end of the series now liking all the sequels more than that one. I think it disappoints a little after the second movie, though, which I was pleasantly surprised by.Tokyo Drift did the impossible by making me wish Vin Diesel would return to the series. The protagonist of Tokyo Drift is very bland, and when Diesel shows up in his cameo near the end, he's so much more charismatic. Guess that sometimes, you don't know what you've got until it's gone. But Paul Walker still trumps Diesel at this stage, and I wonder if Tokyo Drift would've been a little better if they got his character wrapped up in all the stuff the actual main character does.Here's hoping the fourth movie and those after are better. I like these movies when they get silly and over-the-top (and when they're less about racing too, to be honest), and I wish Tokyo Drift had been more consistently goofy. I only really had fun in the final act, and most of the film before then made me feel tired.",Jeremy_Urquhart,2024-06-18,2024,0.03,0.842,0.128,0.984,Positive

315,8.0,It's honestly underrated.,"**Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift** - A Thrilling Yet Underrated Gem""Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,"" the third installment in the high-octane franchise, is often overlooked and underrated. However, it stands out with its unique setting, distinct storyline, and engaging car culture that deserves an 8/10 rating for its sheer entertainment value and innovative approach to the racing genre.Set against the vibrant backdrop of Tokyo, the film immerses viewers in a world of underground drift racing, a subculture known for its precision and artistry. Unlike its predecessors, ""Tokyo Drift"" departs from the familiar characters and locations, offering a fresh perspective and introducing a new protagonist, Sean Boswell, played by Lucas Black. Sean's journey from a troubled teen in America to a drift-racing sensation in Japan forms the crux of the narrative.One of the film's most vital points is its authentic depiction of Tokyo's urban landscape and the intricacies of drift racing. The cinematography captures the city's neon-lit streets and bustling energy, creating a visually stunning experience. The racing scenes are meticulously choreographed, showcasing the skill and finesse required for drift racing. The film does a commendable job of making these sequences thrilling and immersive, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats.Lucas Black's portrayal of Sean is earnest and relatable, even if it lacks the charisma of some of the franchise's other leads. His character's growth and adaptation to a new culture add depth to the storyline. Sung Kang's Han Lue, a fan-favorite, brings a sense of cool and calm to the chaotic world of drift racing, and his mentorship of Sean adds a layer of camaraderie and heart to the film.The supporting cast, including Bow Wow as Twinkie, provides moments of fun and grounding in an otherwise high-stakes environment. The film's antagonist, Takashi, played by Brian Tee, embodies the typical rival but with a nuanced performance that adds complexity to his character. The dynamic between Sean and Takashi drives much of the film's tension, culminating in a gripping climax.""Tokyo Drift"" is not without its flaws. The storyline can sometimes be predictable, and some character arcs feel underdeveloped. However, these shortcomings are overshadowed by the film's strengths. The soundtrack, featuring a mix of hip-hop and electronic beats, complements the fast-paced action and enhances the viewing experience.What truly sets ""Tokyo Drift"" apart is its celebration of car culture. The attention to detail in the vehicles, from classic muscle cars to sleek Japanese imports, is impressive. The film pays homage to the art of car modification and the passion of racing enthusiasts, making it a must-watch for automotive lovers.In retrospect, ""Tokyo Drift"" has aged well, gaining appreciation for its bold departure from the main storyline and its focus on a different aspect of the racing world. It serves as a bridge in the franchise, introducing elements and characters that become pivotal in later films.In conclusion, ""Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" may not have garnered the initial acclaim of its predecessors, but it deserves recognition for its unique contribution to the franchise. Its exhilarating racing sequences, authentic depiction of Tokyo, and deep dive into drift culture make it an underrated gem that merits an 8/10 rating. Whether you're a fan of the series or new to street racing, ""Tokyo Drift"" offers an engaging and visually captivating ride that shouldn't be missed.",zzbvrfwk,2024-06-26,2024,0.032,0.821,0.147,0.9958,Positive
316,5.0,The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift - Jamison Slabaugh,The film is a fun thrilling ride like the first two Fast and Furious films. The street racing cinematography in this film is done much better in my opinion. The pacing and score aren't the best but they don't stand out as issues either. This film is very disconnected from the first two as the film picks up with a new character called Sean. He runs away from all of his problems. Every time he might go to jail he moves away. When he gets to Tokyo and doesn't know how to drift he gets humbled real fast. The love interest in this film is weak in my opinion due to the fact that she has no motives or real character behind the face. The antagonist is just fine. He works for the film but he's nothing special due to the fact that again he doesn't really have any motives other than the fact that Sean embarrassed him and he values pride. Now the relationship between Sean and his father works very well in the film. His father understands and relates to Sean making the decision to not run away from his problems this time. He also just wants what's best for him. Overall not a bad film. 6/10 STARS.,jamisonslabaugh,2024-07-05,2024,0.11,0.737,0.153,0.8989,Positive
317,7.0,"""One car in exchange for knowing what a man's made of? That's a price I can live with.""","FILM: 7.0
Rewatching the 2006 film The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, I find myself enjoying it more than most people seem to. So, here's an unpopular opinion: Tokyo Drift ties as my third favourite film in the series. The film ramps up the fun straight away, ditches the cheese of the second instalment, and goes for an original plot.One of the aspects I appreciate most about Tokyo Drift is its unique setting and storyline. Shifting the focus to Tokyo and introducing the world of drift racing feels fresh and exciting. The races and chases are some of the series' best, with a kinetic energy that keeps me engaged throughout. The soundtrack is another highlight, with its thumping beats perfectly complementing the high-speed action.I know people heap crap on it for not keeping it in the ""family,"" but it's an undeniably fun ride. The absence of the core characters initially feels strange, but the new cast manages to hold their own. Lucas Black as Sean Boswell brings a different kind of protagonist to the table, and I find his journey from outsider to drift racing aficionado quite compelling.The character of Han, played by Sung Kang, is a standout. His cool, mentor-like presence adds depth to the film and makes for some memorable moments. The Tokyo setting is visually stunning, and the film makes excellent use of its locations, showcasing the vibrant cityscape in a way that's both thrilling and immersive.What I like about Tokyo Drift is its ability to balance the adrenaline-pumping action with a story that feels grounded. The film doesn't rely on the over-the-top stunts that the later entries in the series do, and that simpler approach works in its favour.Overall, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a fairly positive experience that brings something fresh and exciting to the franchise. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, I find it to be a fun and engaging film that stands out in its own right.FORMAT: Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.0

318,4.0,Worst one so far,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift brings a fresh setting to the franchise, trading the familiar street races of LA for the neon-lit streets of Tokyo. While the change in scenery adds some visual appeal, the film struggles to capture the same excitement of its predecessors.The drift-racing scenes are well-shot and provide some adrenaline, but the weak plot and lackluster characters weigh the film down. Lucas Black as the lead feels out of place, and his performance is wooden, making it hard to connect with his journey. The dialogue is often clunky, and the absence of key franchise characters leaves a void that's hard to ignore.The movie's saving grace is its depiction of Tokyo's underground car culture, which adds a unique flair. However, without much substance behind the flashy action, Tokyo Drift ends up feeling like a hollow entry in the Fast & Furious series.",Bmore-Hero,2024-09-20,2024,0.099,0.825,0.076,-0.5789,Negative
319,10.0,Underrated Movie Gem (11/10),"I really cannot state enough how much overhated this movie was back in the day and actually still is, one reason being that (Tokyo Drift) actually is The Fast & Furious film to follow the street racing format the most, while it also is one of the most realistic F&F films and it also have some of the best, most intense and most believable acting in the whole franchise, Though these reasons a not actually the reasons that I really believe that this movie doesn't get the love it deserves. No, what I really believe makes Tokyo Drift stand out is that how perfect the cast is and how nearly every actor in Tokyo Drift compliments each other in so many ways and gives it so much more believability, and really just makes it the best action movie having the aspect of cars, love and friendship being put so perfectly together giving you A Racing film which fits Don Torreto's way of thinking way better than the mainline F&F movies about what family is and how we as humans have to stand together with those who have helped us through life!!",RealCJHopkins,2024-11-01,2024,0.032,0.81,0.158,0.9817,Positive
320,6.0,Probably the best entry in the franchise so far.,"Tokyo Drift feels like it's actually trying to be a normal film. There's barely any horrible CGI and the driving stunts are more impressive than ever.I remember a lot of the audience at the time being annoyed that Vin wasn't the main character. I couldn't care less. Sean is a decent protagonist and Han is the most interesting side character so far.The setting is the most interesting part, they manage to sell it as Tokyo pretty well and there's a great chase sequence in the streets.When it comes to the writing, the dialogue is laughable at times, and the tropes of the franchise are very prevalent in this one.However, the worst part about the film's story is that the writers for later films want us to believe this entry takes place in 2014. Ah, 2014, the age of flip phones and 2006 music. Yeah, nice work guys.At least it's a big step up from 2 Fast 2 Furious. Who could have predicted the trajectory of the sequels after watching this?",H4wke,2024-11-05,2024,0.082,0.773,0.145,0.8667,Positive
321,7.0,Drifting into a Side Story: A Review of The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, released in 2006 (but still very watchable in 2025!), Like I said in my previous review for 2 Fast 2 Furious, this one also feels less like a direct sequel and more like a high-octane DLC or spin-off to the first two films. While it doesn't quite reach the heights of The Fast and the Furious or 2 Fast 2 Furious, it still manages to deliver a fun, albeit flawed, experience that car enthusiasts will likely enjoy.This installment shifts gears, leaving the familiar faces behind and introducing us to Sean Boswell, a troubled teen with a penchant for street racing. We get a fleeting glimpse of his life in America before he's shipped off to Tokyo to live with his estranged father. Here's one of the biggest drawbacks: Sean's backstory feels rushed and underdeveloped. His motivations beyond the need to escape trouble aren't fully explored. The absence of any real delving into his relationship with either his mother or father feels like a missed opportunity for emotional resonance, leaving them as mere plot devices rather than fully fleshed-out characters.The same can be said for the primary antagonist, DK, the ""Drift King"". While his scenes are effectively antagonistic, the movie glosses over his character beyond his rivalry with Sean and his connection to his mob-boss uncle. We barely scratch the surface of what drives him or his position in the Tokyo underworld, making him feel like a fairly one-dimensional villain. I think with more character development on DK and Sean's family, this would have been a much better movieDespite these shortcomings in character development, Tokyo Drift shines in other areas. The introduction of Han, with his effortlessly cool demeanor and laid-back wisdom, is a definite highlight. He quickly became a fan favorite for a reason, and his presence elevates the film. Neela, Sean's love interest, also provides a strong and engaging personality. She adds a layer of complexity to the story rather than just being a damsel in distress.Visually, Tokyo Drift is a treat. The detailed model cars, a reflection of the drift scene in Japan, are fantastic, and the vibrant soundtrack perfectly complements the fast-paced driving sequences. The film captures the neon-drenched, bustling atmosphere of Tokyo, creating an immersive and aesthetically pleasing experience. The drift sequences are exciting and entertaining, even if they don't always push the limits of reality. I think the cinematography and editing is quite good here.Overall, Tokyo Drift is a decent entry in the Fast & Furious franchise and is an enjoyable experience. It's a step down in terms of character development from its predecessors and feels more like a side story than a direct continuation, but It still delivers a visually engaging and entertaining ride. The Tokyo setting alone is worth the watch, and the introduction of Han makes for a memorable character. While not perfect, Tokyo Drift earns a solid 7/10, proving that even when the franchise takes a turn into a different street, it can still be enjoyable.",douglasc11,2025-01-03,2025,0.089,0.697,0.215,0.9978,Positive
322,5.0,"This one is a little much, and deviates too much from the original","I like how they tried to tell a new story within the Fast and the Furious franchise, but this one goes a bit too far in trying to deliver on the action without the story to back it up. It just isn't the same with the main character being more of a loner than someone who teams up and is all about family. The cars aren't as good, the acting isn't as good, the story isn't as good. It is a fun watch if you are just looking for driving and action, but it doesn't go much further than that. It is still a big enough part of the franchise to put ""Tokyo Drift"" into our vernacular probably forever, but the re-watch of this one doesn't warrant a very high rating when compared to some other movies in the franchise.",jaredlemin,2025-01-08,2025,0.097,0.862,0.04,-0.8326,Negative
323,6.0,"Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift - Drifting, Clichés, and a Crash Course in Japanese","Sean Boswell, the undisputed king of crashing for no reason, gets shipped off to Japan like a faulty Amazon return. The guy arrives in Tokyo with all the finesse of an American tourist in socks and sandals. His mission? Lay low. What does he do instead? Finds the underground drifting scene and immediately forgets about staying out of trouble. It's like giving a GTA player a car and expecting them to follow traffic laws.Lucas Black as Sean is that guy from your high school who thinks he's cool because he can do donuts in the parking lot, but everyone knows he's one mistake away from wrapping his car around a tree. He tries to be the main character, but let's be real: his charisma is about as strong as a dying car battery. Han Lue, the real MVP, effortlessly steals the spotlight. Whenever Han's on screen, Sean might as well be a turn signal nobody's using.Justin Lin knows how to shoot Tokyo at night-neon lights, shadowy alleys, and a constant sense of danger lurking around every corner. But the most glowing thing here isn't the city or the cars-it's the clichés. We get it all: a bargain-bin romance, neighborhood rivalries, and women circling cars like they're waiting for a discount fashion shoot. Honestly, Mario Kart has more emotional depth.Where the film really shines is on the asphalt. The drifting scenes are filmed with so much care you can practically smell the burnt rubber. Justin Lin shows Michael Bay that you don't need a thousand explosions to create adrenaline-pumping action. The drifts are tight, the engines roar, and you're glued to your seat. But let's be clear: even the best car chases can't save a plot that barely fills a sticky note.As for the villain, DK (Drift King-seriously, who approved this?), he's a walking stereotype. The guy squints menacingly like he's either plotting Sean's downfall or struggling to read small text. The yakuza subplot? As threatening as overcooked sushi. You're never actually worried about Sean, because the whole thing is as predictable as sunrise.Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift is like grabbing McDonald's at 3 a.m.: you know it won't provide much substance, but it hits the spot for now. The drifting scenes are spectacular, but everything around them is as flat as a tire with a nail in it. Watch it once, appreciate Han's chill dominance, and forget the rest.",OniFR,2025-02-04,2025,0.112,0.752,0.137,0.8969,Positive
