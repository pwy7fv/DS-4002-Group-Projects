7.0,Great action and illogic make this a good B movie,"The Fast and the Furious star the always good Vin Diesel as a car racer- on the streets.  He meets Brian (Paul Walker) in a good stoke of luck as he saves him from the cops.  Then some more plot comes in into the film, but it the action that counts here.Giving credit where credit is due, the film has outstanding action sequences involving car chases that haven't been this exhilarating since the infamous pod race in Phantom Menace.  Plus (and surprisingly), the film envelops you into the story, and it makes you feel some actual feeling for the characters among the blaze of the cars.  And for that I reccomend this movie for the thrill seeking audience that has chomped up the recent popcorn flicks such as Mummy 2, Tomb Raider and Swordfish (Fast and Furious is one of the best ones of it's kind so far this year).However, with most B flicks come the inevitable flaws, and this has 2 usual yet still dumb ones.  1, from the looks at some of the steamy and violent scenes in the movie, it looks like as if director Cohen was making a rated R movie filled with even more action, sexual content and dare I say naughty language in the mix.  Yet, once again, it might seem, the guys up top have made this film into yet another PG-13 flick to try and up the sales.  That's why say what you will about the South Park movie, but at least they kept on trying at it until they got the R (and that is also evident from the s**t episode from 2 days ago) unlike such movies as Bring It On and Coyote Ugly.And 2 (illogical part), this film takes place in Los Angeles, a city that is sometimes called the city on wheels.  Then how come when the race in the streets scenes come up, you almost see no cars whatsoever on the streets (unless it's used for the plot or something)?  I have a feeling that even though this doesn't have much logic in it, at least it's better here than in New York, cause then it would be just plain ludicrous.  Anyway, like I said, It's a good action movie, though not a great one.  Kudos go to the director, stunt co-ordinators, drivers and Diesel.

6.0,Good fun action movie,"I particularly like sport imports, so I had to see this movie.  The action sequences I felt were shot very well.  The story, is basically Point Break with Street racing vs. Surfing.  Cop poses as street racer, attempts to gain confidence of a Race Team, who happens to hijack big rigs with electronics equipment to fund their adrenaline rush, street racing.Some of the camera work and angle shots for the crashes are great. 
Although some may feel there was not much substance, at least you do get character feel, unlike what you could say of the other summer action movies so far this year.Worth a matinee visit, and if you like street imports, you'll probably want to own the DVD when it comes out.",kraziken,2001-06-22,2001,Positive,0.0,0.855,0.145,0.9571

This really is an excellent film about street racers. Incredible racing scenes, an involving plot, but best of all, more gorgeous cars than you can shake a Civic at.

10.0,"Something has happened here, something very rare.","Something has happened here in The Fast and the Furious. Something that I have not seen for a very long time. What is it? An awesome, entertaining ""movie"". I think we need to take a moment here to look at what is going on here. Most critics are always looking for a masterpiece, or an epic. Movies like Gladiator, which are amazing, but not all movies have to be like this. This movie is meant for sheer entertainment, that is all. If you smile, get into the story a little, think the action kicks ass, and have an all around great fun time, then I think it's a good movie. That's what has happened here. I went to see this movie knowing its a hated piece of work. I mean, look at its raiting on IMDB-4.5/10. That's pretty bad. I think this is a movie that most people won't like. There is a certain crowd that will, and if you like the movie, you're in that crowd. Let me give you a list of the best parts of the movie:Vin Diesel: He is like Arnold for the Millenium. He ROCKS!!!The hot chicks: They are all over this movie, we even get a little girl on girl kissing!The cars: I'm sitting in the theater drooling over the amazing race cars in this movie.The action: It's intense, and NON-STOP.So, do you like those things I just listed? Well then, The Fast and the Furious is a movie you HAVE to see.Let me say it again: The Fast and the Furious is something I haven't seen for a long time. It's pure entertainment. And for that reason, I give The Fast and the Furious a 10/10.",Nick E A,2001-06-22,2001,Positive,0.104,0.697,0.199,0.9858
10.0,Worth The Ticket Price,"The Fast And The Furious is a thrill ride from beginning to end.  The heart pounding action made me squirm in my chair.  The cleverly filmed racing sequence was amazing and from that point on my eyes were glued to the screen.  Although the plotline isn't very original they carried it well. Vin Diesel, who played the roll of the street racing leader, gave a strong performance and you could really feel for each character.  I even started feeling sorry for the evil Japanese gang leader.The semi-jacking scenes were awesome.  They totally freaked me out... in a cool way though.  I didn't know what to expect.  Paul Walker's acting was pretty Keanu-ish.  He was a total surfer boy throughout the whole movie. The make-up people were trying way too hard to make him look rugged and normal.  It was pretty hard for me to believe HE was a cop. He's way too boyish and cute for the part.  But, I have to admit, those looks of his were one of the reasons I wanted to see the movie. In the end it came together really well. I suggest that you don't wait for this one to come out on video because you will be missing so much.  With the surround sound of the theater, the engines mixed with the soundtrack and the plot work great together.  I went in expecting a B+ and i got blown away by an A+++++++ movie.",ttjam,2001-06-22,2001,Positive,0.055,0.808,0.137,0.9645

2.0,"Boy, oh boy, did this suck.","This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  I didn't want to see his movie, but my friends really wanted to see it bad. It was sold out, but we got into the 12:15am show time and the theater was packed! AT 12:15!! I don't understand what the appeal of this movie is. A bunch of fast cars? Fast cars does not a good movie make.The dialogue of this movie was terrible. There wasn't anything interesting said the whole time.  My friends (who LOVED the movie) tried to defend it saying that they talked like real people talk. Well, if I want to see real people talk I'll go to the barber shop or something; somewhere where I don't have to pay $8.25. Such lines as ""It doesn't matter if you win by an inch or a mile, winning is winning."" and ""I'll have the tuna fish,"" are the most memorable, and believe me they really sucked.The plot hardly got in the way of the blatant attempt to make a movie just for the reason of a bunch of cars going really fast. And audiences couldn't WAIT to see a bunch of cars going really fast. Maybe these people should watch NASCAR or something, then they won't have to worry about ignoring some piddly plot. If you want to see a GOOD movie with cars see Bullitt.Who hired these actors? ALL of them were terrible especially Vin Diesel who sleeps through the movie. My guess is they spent so much money on the cars that they could only afford to hire fifth rate actors.I gave this movie a 2 out of 10. The only reason it didn't get a 1, is because of the cars, if the scenes with the cars were surrounded by something that didn't make me want to ride the bus from now on, then maybe it could've gotten a higher rating.",hydrofuzz,2001-06-23,2001,Positive,0.077,0.792,0.131,0.975
10.0,The Ultimate Summer Movie,"I just back from seeing The Fast and the Furious and i have to say i have never been so pumped after seeing a film. Keep in mind from the moment i saw the trailer for this film i wanted desperately to see it. It had fast cars, Fast girls, and it guaranteed some pretty cool action sequences. Needless to say that i wasn't disappointed and this has made my list of best movie of the summer so far.The plot in this film is pretty basic. A undercover cop named Brian(Paul Walker) is sent to get the inside scoop on a group of street racers who may or may not be smuggling equipment from pick-up trucks. The street racing team is lead by Dom(Vin Diesel). Brian however begins to fall for Dom's sister Mia(Jordana Brewster) and things begin to become truly complicated.Why is this the ultimate summer movie? You can go into this film with no expectations and be truly entertained. It's mindless fun so to speak and it's a good way to spend 90 minutes. I enjoyed every minute of this film and as the title promises there is a lot of Furious action.The racing sequences are done really well and are the best i've seen in a long while. There are some good camera shots and camera angles and these shots make the races even more exhilarating. The best sequence has to be towards to end that involves cars and one big pick-up truck.The acting is also pretty good. Vin Diesel is going to be huge. He is a very commanding performer and he alone carries this film acting wise. The same can not be said for Paul Walker who is very flat. I said this before in my review of the skulls the guy needs some lessons stat. The girls are really good in the film. Jordana brewster displays the sensitvity and sensuality that is needed to portray her character and Michelle Rodriguez as dom's girlfriend letty is just one big ball of sass. i loved this character and i wish she could've been in the film more.All in all a good summer movie. i'm sure you won't be disappointed.",MissCzarChasm,2001-06-23,2001,Positive,0.04,0.76,0.2,0.9965
6.0,"Great Cars, Cool Stunts, Bad Movie","I attended an advance screening of ""The Fast and the Furious"" with high anticipation. Here, I thought, is my cool sexy action movie for the summer. I was looking for pure entertainment with just a thread of credibilty. What I got was a lopsided movie with great cars, amazing stunts, crappy acting, and bad editing. If one-fourth of the attention given to the cars had been paid to the acting and the human film story, the movie would have been just fine. Unfortunately, this was not the case.First of all, this movie really reminded me of Point Break with Keanu Reeves, only instead of surfing, street racing is the centerpiece.Both stories are completely improbable. Both stories involve green cops sent to infiltrate gangs of thieves who use the loot to fund their expensive hobbies. In both films, the hero jeopardizes his case by gaining a dangerous level of respect for the charismatic leader of the band of thieves.  The big difference between the two films is that while Point Break works, The Fast and the Furious does not. The failing point of this film is the lead actor. Paul Walker is the sucking-chest wound of this movie. Yeah, he's pretty, but he completely unable to emote or communicate anything about his character. Even in the presence of excellent actors like Vin Diesel and Ted Levine, he is like a plank of wood. Jordana Brewster isn't too pro either. All the other actors(including Michelle Rodriguez)do a fine job.
Had the basic criteria been met(competent lead actor, clean editing), The Fast and the Furious could have been great. As is, it is moderately awful.",labebe,2001-06-23,2001,Positive,0.083,0.766,0.151,0.9565
6.0,Good and the Bad . . .,"Ya know when you have a film that borders on A & B yet just cant quite make ups its mind? Thats my fast take on this high octane red line effort. Especially if your a youngster into the whole car group racing thing, then your gonna 'Love' this film. Yet if you look deeper to the qualities that make an all around good film, then you'll be a bit dissapointed, yet still you will be entertained. The best part about this film to me was watching for the first time, actor 'Paul Walker' Being a cross resemblance of Timothy Hutton and Rob Lowe, Paul Walker is an actor I'm keeping an eye on. Though I've never seen him, this Southern California native is no stranger to acting and will have me viewing some of his past work. The directing and some of the writing was a bit adolescent yet at times (such as during certain action/race sequences), it made good quarter mile time. No, not a waste of money, especially since finding Paul Walker, yet not a film Vin Diesel should hold up to the light. Worth the watch, worth the video rental, yet it wont be in my collection.",FilmFan777,2001-06-23,2001,Positive,0.026,0.854,0.12,0.9573
6.0,"Big, dumb, fast and fun","Big dumb fast and fun.I was talking with a friend of mine who is into customizing cars  - he has a gorgeous Honda Accord that has a new addition every time I see him - when I saw the first trailers for this movie.  We agreed that there would be some great cars, gorgeous women, awesome racing sequences and people condemning the film for irresponsibly promoting street racing.  All our suspicions proved correct, but most surprising was the lateness of the negative publicity for the film - I didn't see an article until today (interesting side note, the author had been cruising the international custom car bulletin boards for weeks trying to get interviews, but no one would bite). 
Blond haired blue-eyed Brian Spindler is sent to find the people responsible for several precision big rig hijackings.  He searches for his quarry among the street racing gangs of LA, where he meets and tries to ingratiate himself with Dominic Torreto, the prince of the racing set.  Brian soon finds himself in the middle of a bubbling gang war, and is being pressured by his superiors to get a bust. Things get complicated when Brian finds himself falling for Dominic's sister and at odds with the other members of Dom's crew.  But just when he thinks things can't get any worse, Brian gets an unpleasant surprise.I'm not going to rave about an intricate plot, zippy well scripted dialogue or in-depth character studies, because they simply aren't present, indeed there are several laughingly bad lines, and the acting is generally subpar This film is about action, and the sequences are some of the best to grace the movie screen  in a long time:  the driving is phenomenal, that stunts are amazing (no digital enhancement here) and the cars are very impressive. Although the film is a little over the top in some aspects - not every car customizer uses Nitrous Oxide or races their cars (most would be terrified that they might scratch or god forbid crash, their cars)- I think they have managed to capture the spirit of this unique subculture.   The acting is definitely a mixed bag.I've enjoyed Vin Diesel's roles, even though I've not been that enamoured of the films he's been in.  In a recent interview, he explained that he's drawn to anti-heroes as he finds them more interesting than the white shirted good guys, and I tend to agree with his observations.  As Diesel recently stated, Dominic is a man of his word, who believes in honor, but happens to ""live outside the law"" and his is the only character that is adequately fleshed out in the film.   Paul Walker plays Brian as possibly the most inept undercover cop to grace the screen - the only way he could stand out more in the group he's trying to infiltrate would be to wear a Village People costume.  Donnie Brasco he ain't.   This is exacerbated by the fact that Walker's portrayal is virtually bereft of any real emotion, and his soulless delivery of several corny lines renders them even worse than they were written- quite a feat.  The biggest disappointment for me was the waste of Michelle  Rodriguez - who distinguished herself in ""Girl Fight"" - whose soul purpose is to linger on screen and scowl.  A tremendous waste of a valuable commodity.If you're looking for a punchy matinee, without a lot of dialogue or plot to get in the way, settle in for the ride.",Shiva-11,2001-06-23,2001,Positive,0.093,0.766,0.141,0.9816

I have a confession to make...I told people this movie was going to suck. Fast/Furious probably lost some money from me, and I just want to apologize. I was going to give this movie an 8 instead of a 7 as an apology, but then I realized the finale leaves too many loose ends, and I'll die before I see a movie called The Faster and the Furiouser, or The Fast and the Furious 2: Even Faster.

8.0,"The Fast and the Furious was so good, I felt the need to register and share my views of the movie, thats how good it is","Don't let anyone fool you, the Fast and the Furious is a wonderfully entertaining movie. If you saw the trailer and though that it looked like a fun roller coaster ride styled action movie then you are absolutely correct. The best summation you could give of the film is that its like two hours of what you see in the trailer. It's seriously one of the most accurately advertised and needless to say one of the most fun and entertaining movies of the year.The racing scenes have been cleverly filmed and edited together in a way that gives you a false sense of motion with lots of first person views as cars race down the street. In addition, just about every scene in the movie looks really sharp thanks to nice lighting, some visual effects, and just plain good camera work. The direction of camera work for the most part is very traditional in the sense that each major scene is proceeded by a few seconds of a `set up' shot that gives you a feeling for the size and surroundings of a scene locale. The majority of the dialogue shots and racing shots are of course third person, however, many of these shots are extremely tight giving you a very strong sense of being there.
Vin Diesel's performance is convincing and very entertaining. He's extremely enigmatic and seems to have that quality that some actors like Bruce Willis have. That quality of coming off as being an extremely cool person who you just know you'd be best friends with. Paul Walker's performance while somewhat wooden, really isn't bad at all. In fact if you really stopped and thought about his character's motivation Paul's on screen apprehension and uncertainty early in the film actually fits his character. Stack that up against his wide eyed and completely commanding on screen presence toward the end of the film and you've got the complete emotional stages of his character that realistically depicts a man in his situation. The rest of the main cast really deserves a lot of credit too. Sure they might not be a lot well known actors, but I'd have to imagine that a few of them will be after a few casting agents see this movie since there really isn't a bad performance in the movie.The writing and dialogue is fairly decent. Sure it isn't the most original story ever, but it does a great job of delivering a plot through the use of a lot of action. The dialogue while a bit awkward a couple of times is for the most part well done.In the end, you won't be disappointed in The Fast and the Furious if you like action movies, cars, or Vin Diesel. The story is decent, the sound and visuals are fantastic, and you'll walk out of the theater with a big smile and the undying urge to drive really reckless while listening to loud music. The PG-13 rating is a very liberal one by the way, people shoot and are shot by guns on screen, some language, some slight skin, but since the movie moves so fast and is so loud, you really think you hear and see more than you actually do.

I am a female who LOVES cars and this movie just made me want to be a race car driver.  So don't let Rolling Stone magazine and other newspapers determine whether you see this movie or not.  This movie fits our generation and you can't help but leave the theater with a smile on your face and feel the urge to shout, ""Yeah!!""Oh, and people did drive out of the parking lot with screeching tires after the movie.

Out of ALL the car movies I have seen, this is BY FAR the best.Other people who have reviewed this movie said it's ""crap"", ""not worth you're money"", ""mindless and illogical"".  But some people just need to lighten up and turn on their ""action movie"" senses when they go to see an action movie like the Fast And The Furious, apparently they have their ""serious movie"" senses on.  This movie has great car scenes, is very true to life, some say it isn't, it is, and is a VERY fun movie to watch.The is DEFINENTELY the most awesome and kick ass movie I have ever seen, it isn't the best, but it IS the most awesome.  It is WELL worth you're money. No movie is perfect though...well...almost no movie, this movie has 2 little flaws.  #1.  All the cars were riceburners, they had 1 Ferrari, they needed more BMW M3's!!!!!  And #2.  The ending kind of leaves you wondering a few questions.  Vin Diesel is as good as he was in Pitch Black, a movie I HIGHLY recommend you see, ESPECIALLY with surround sound and the volume UP.  But I would give The Fast & The Furious a 99 out of 100.

10.0,Clearly one of the best movies of the summer,I just walked out of this movie and I'm still trying to catch my breath. Vin Disel (the next big action star) plays Dom a drag racer/mechaninc who is caught up in a stolen goods ring. Paul Walker(the next Rob Lowe) plays Brian an undercover cop sent to inflriate Dom's gang and try to stop them. The film also a subplot where Dom's gang has beef with an Asain crew lead by Rick Yune. Things complicate when Brian falls for Dom's sister played by the very sexy Jordanna Brewster. The film has a great supporing star in Michelle Rodgurez and cameo by Ja Rule. It also has some of the best car chase scenes since Ronin. Just go and enjoy this film.,DunnDeeDaGreat,2001-06-23,2001,Positive,0.076,0.764,0.16,0.9041

When I went to see this movie, I wasn't thinking I would leave the theater I marveling at the emotional ending, I expected to leave wanting to peel-out of the parking lot and get home in the fastest time possible, racing down the highway not caring about anything else.

7.932203389830510,didn't _want_ to like this...,"... and ""schindler's list"" it ain't. But for a low-IQ summer testosterone flick, ""The Fast and the Furious"" is surprisingly involving. The car scenes are remarkable, the soundtrack ""bangs"" (in the parlance of our times) and some of the performances are quite good. Vin Diesel, as usual, manages to rise above some pretty cheesemo dialogue and make conflicted-dude Dom into someone fascinating. This guy is one hell of an actor. Paul Walker, playing protagonist Spindler, is pretty but not terribly charismatic; he has a kind of blonde-Keanu thing going on. Diesel and Chad Lindberg, as ADD-afflicted mechanic Jesse, are more engaging. The women are more ""types"" than anything else but this is fundamentally a Guy Flick and two-dimensional chicks are to be expected.What I didn't expect was well-written supporting characters, ethnic diversity without preachiness on the topic, and lovely cinematography (it's stylish without being excessively MTV, and LA looks just like itself.) The plot is a little loopy, but there's more than enough here to justify buying a $4 discount-twilight ticket.

Either a film entertains you or it doesn't.After seeing THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS with the target audience (that would be with the ethnically diverse kids of L.A. as depicted up on the screen), I'm convinced that what critics say about any movie no longer matters.  The audience I sat in ate it up!As long as a movie studio can market and successfully test a movie AND it connects with an audience, it's golden (the film's release date was moved back, by the way, but only because the studio execs at Universal were confident that it could compete with other big summer movies).  I will go as far as saying this will be the sleeper hit of summer 2001. There are enough elements here (good looking stars, cool soundtrack, lots of action, and for the romantics a love story) for it to appeal to a large audience.As for the rest of you who are perhaps a bit older or not into cars:  You'll probably walk out of the theater with a headache after all the bone-crunching stunts and loud hiphop and hard rock on the soundtrack.Personally, I was totally entertained.  Imagine taking the CGI technology of the special effects from STAR WARS and the energy of THE ROAD WARRIOR and combining them with road racing -- that will give you a good idea what the race/action scenes are like in this flick.I am into cars.

Vin Diesel played an excellent part in this movie.  ever since 'Pitch Black' was released - I've been waiting to see another movie with him in it.  All characters had a good roll actually.

8.0,"Great movie, but...","I went in wanting to see this movie, and it delivered on everything I had hoped for.  It did have a reasonable plot, and what it was lacking for in plot it made up for in character development.  It had style and great actions scenes.  The story never got boring, and I stayed interested until the end.  I am sure that eveyone leaving the theater with me wanted to burn rubber as they drove home. (The difference being, I can, in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd!) What is lacking in this movie is any intelligent explanation of the science behind the speed.  Throughout the movie we learn 2 things.  1, nitrous makes a car go faster, and 2, you have to press the button at the right time.  I dont think I ever heard anyone in this movie mention the size of the engine for any of the cars raced.  Diesel, who again does a great job - contrary to those who assume big muscles mean no brains and automatically pan him - does give a top to bottom on his father's car, but it is never raced.  I guess we have to assume these are basically japanese compact cars that are painted nicely and mod'd out to the max, and that's the only reason they come close to matching the speed and power of classic street-rods. Still, I really would have liked there to have been more explanations of why Car A is faster than Car B, and known why Car B's driver needs to use his wits to win.

7.932203389830510,"If you want Racing, it doesn't get any better than this!","I went to see the movie on the first day, with much, much anticipation. I walked in 15 minutes prior to start of the flick, and I could not find 2 seats together since I went with my brother. After 5 minutes of going through the theatre and sitting down, public relations announced that our show is sold out. What I came to realize, is that night that wasn't the only one. EVERY SINGLE SHOW FOR THE 3 DAY WEEKEND WAS SOLD OUT. Doesn't that tell you something? This will be the sleeper hit of this summer.The Fast and the Furious is a mix of adrenaline rushes, compelling racing story, and the overall ""good"" bad guy lead. Vin Diesel rocks as Dominic Toretto, the man of racing in L.A. I've seen everything Diesel has ever done, and every time he exceeded my expectations. Paul Walker is Brian O'Connor, the undercover cop trying to crack a truck-jacking case. I've seen Paul in a couple of flicks, and even though he's no great actor, I don't think I could imagine anyone else who could do it. These two and the rest of the cast are half of what makes this movie. The other half, is the cars, and the driving, which is downright terrific, Gone in 60 doesn't stand a chance. Overall, the movie made me jump in my seat,  speed up my heart beat, and I have to admit, cry. I came out of the show in complete awe, not for the acting, or the story, but for the overall content. I saw it all three weekend days, and must say, it only got better.If you're a fan of driving, cars, and great young actors, this is definitely a movie for you and I highly recommend it. Do not listen to all these big time critics like Ebert & Roeper. These guys aren't us, and can't tell us what we like.

8.0,A genuinely great B movie,"..and I really mean that. I was very pleasantly surprised to find that its scorching visuals and enormous kinetic energy were backed up by a fine, sympathetic performance by imposing Vin Diesel and, overall, what I like to call ""a good heart"" --a film that isn't nihilistic and bitter at the core but has humanity and a sense of values. I had no trouble understanding why our cop hero, himself once in trouble with the law, slowly gravitated away from his chilly bosses and toward the vitality and warmth of the street racers' family unit, with its backyard picnics, protection of weaker members and strong internal loyalty.  I won't go into a lot about the plot, not because it doesn't have one but because you don't need to know: just know that if you get sick of movies where people do bad things for no reason, this one will make you feel better.

10.0,Incredible!,"Being a part of the import scene, I was extremely nervous about the release of ""The Fast and the Furious"".  Visions of riced-out Civic's running 7 second quarter miles danced through my nightmares for weeks on end.  We even went out and rented The Skulls (with Paul Walker) and Pitch Black (with Vin Diesel) just to see what the acting was going to be like.  We had already seen The Faculty, so we knew what a hotty Jordana Brewster was.You cannot imagine my relief on opening night, as we emerged from the theater.  IT WAS INCREDIBLE!  There were very few ridiculous antics to be seen anywhere in the film.  My beefs are as follows:Civics driving under big rigs.  Totally unrealistic.  But come on, this is Hollywood.  It looked cool, just let it go.They lead you to believe green non-turbo Eclipse is turbocharged.  Anyone associated with the industry knows all about that Eclipse.  It has been in magazines and is well documented.  The film makers even admit to the fact that it is a non-turbo, yet still proceed to tell you it IS turbocharged and even dubbed in blow-off valve noises when it shifts.  But again, its a MOVIE.  We have actors pretending to be things they are not, so what is the difference if they pretend the car is something its not.Paul Walker's acting.  From time to time in the movie, he really nails a line and conveys incredible amounts of emotion.  (Like the scene where he and Dom are eating lunch alone together)  But other times his delivery is just plain flat.  (Like where he offers up his pink slip to race)  If you just focus on the acting of Vin Diesel (which was just awesome) you should be able to overlook Paul Walker's short comings.They had to bring something illegal into it.  Well, apart from the fact that street racing is illegal in the first place, that is.  I am sure there is someone, somewhere, who street races and IS in fact a criminal.  But the way it is portrayed in this movie is just ridiculous.  But again, this is Hollywood we are talking about.  If there was nothing like that going on, there would be no plot.  Just be happy its not drugs.Nitrous Oxide was over used.  Especially on turbocharged cars.  Anyone who has ever tuned a turbocharged car knows that it is no small task. Maintaining a safe air-fuel ratio while maximizing power is tough.  Adding nitrous-oxide into the mix (which requires additional fuel to go with it) is damned near impossible.  Only the top of the line professional racers pull it off as a large power adder and do it safely.  The fact that almost every car in this movie has both a turbocharger AND nitrous is just ridiculous. HOWEVER.. with that being said, it definitely adds something to the suspense of the race scenes.  It gives the director the ability to make someone appear to be losing a race, and let them hit their NOS button at the last minute to start a come back and make it close.  So although it is a bit unrealistic that so many people would run nitrous oxide, it adds entertainment value to the film.So thats it!  The movie was extremely well done.  The editing is great, and there are some parts that really keep you on the edge of your seat.  It is by no means predictable, either.  There are many parts of the movie that could really go either way, and the director does a great job of keeping you in the dark until the scene ends.  The interaction between Brian, Mia, and Vince was great too.  You could feel the love Vince has for Dominic and his crew, and that he really feels he is protecting them from Brian.The characters are believable, and you really find yourself caring for them and what happens to them.  The action is great AND believable (if you can overlook a few minor things).GO SEE THIS MOVIE!

The cars may have changed, but not much else. Street racing has always been and will be, a part of our culture (if not a somewhat darker part) as long as there are automobiles on roads. The acting is ""average"", although Vin Diesel is beginning to make it very plain that he is coming into his own as he gets more work. -Very cool in Pitch Black by the way. I give the action scenes a high score as they do give the viewer an excellent impression of the speed experienced behind the wheel of these cars. Special effects and stunts are ""well toned"" and placed where they need to be. By now you might guess that I really enjoyed this flick. I just hope the DVD is a collector's edition with lots of extras, especially with more racing footage!

But if you expect a fast-paced, choppy movie with lots of revving cars, gorgeous women, testosterone and chase scenes, you will be thrilled with the latest summer popcorn movie to hit the screens.For an action movie with lots of cars, this rates well, on a par with Gone in 60 Seconds.

It's an action flick glorifying the lives of these young punks who drive their souped up pieces of s***.  Except for one thing though....the folks driving the cars in this movie were older, and richer.  But just as lame. It came as no surprise to me that I was probably the oldest person in the theater when I watched this.  And I am 26 years old!This film has the architecture of a porn.  The spine of the movie is the action, but there always seems to be a token plot.  Ok, so this undercover police officer is trying to bust these car-racing hoodlums, and falls in love with the sister of the leader.  The writers seemed to put something into that aspect of the story.  So what happens to the couple at the end? Nobody knows.  And why should we?  It had nothing to do with the fast driving.  The writers tried to develop a character for Vin Diesel, but they forgot one thing: a story that actually needs a developed character!  The ""emotional"" scenes were thrown in randomly, as were the personality traits of the characters.  Presumably, just so that they could say that ""The Fast and the Furious"" is really a ""movie"".  Doesn't that sound like a porn to you?Honestly though?  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.  It's just plain mindless entertainment.

8.0,There's something about Vin,"Every summer a film comes around that takes everyone by surprise.  Last year it was Scary Movie and I'm sure in 1977 it was a film like Star Wars and then in 1981 it was Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Now I am not saying that The Fast and the Furious is in the same class as Raiders and Star Wars, just that it surprised everyone on the same level.  F&F is short on plot and dialogue and even some of the acting is lame, but what it is oozes is testosterone.  It pumps your blood, increases your adrenaline and attacks you with fast cars, sexy women and that one invariable that I think it has going for it... Vin Diesel.  There is just something about the guy, something that you really can't put your finger on, but he just has it. Maybe it is charisma, maybe it is charm, maybe it is just that he resembles some of the action heroes from the 80's with his chiseled triceps and his slabs of pecs.  Maybe it is all those things and maybe it is none of those things, all I know is that F&F is exactly what I had hoped it would be and nothing more.  This is the summer movie that I have been waiting for.  It's not that the films that have been out so far aren't that great because some of them are, it's just that this is the one that epitomises what summer as a teen ager is all about.  It is no wonder that exit polls for this film were around 65-70% under the age of 21.  And maybe that is why I enjoyed it so much.  I am pushing 30 but isn't it cool to lose yourself in a film that reminds you what it was like to be in highschool.  And isn't it cool to watch street racers break 140 miles an hour wile they shoot NOS through their vehicles?  Well isn't it?F&F doesn't contain any machinations similar to a film like Mission Impossible and it doesn't dazzle us with special effects of impending doom like Armageddon did, but it takes us into a world where people live life ""a quarter of a mile at a time.""  Vin Diesel plays Dominic Toretto, a massive, bald mechanic that owns a garage but street races on the side to make some extra cash.  Paul Walker ( The Skulls, Varsity Blues) plays Brian Spindler.  He is a cop that has infiltrated the street gang to find out who is highjacking trucks and stealing all their merchandise.  There are about four rival street gangs in L.A. and one of them is pulling this off.  He has to figure out which one. Of course along the way he seduced by the life, but that is not what we really care about.  All we want to see is lots of racing, a few crashes, some fights and some sex.  F&F doesn't disappoint.  If what you have seen in the trailers of the film excites and entices you, then you know exactly what you're in for.  This is not going to win any Oscars for anything but what it will do is entertain you.  It will expedite you for 90 minutes into a world where Honda's are souped up to look like Dragons and junkyard scraps are rebuilt from scratch to be better than they were before, better, stronger and faster.  If this film appealed to you in the commercial, it will appeal to you on the screen.And of course there is Vin Diesel.  He first made a name for himself in Saving Private Ryan where he played Capparrzo.  Then he jumped onto the scene with his excellent and grandiose turn as Riddick in Pitch Black.  I think this is the film that got him noticed because no one had even heard of him before this.  Then he did Boiler Room and he showed a different side to him.  But F&F is all muscle and sheer bravado.  I think Vin is going to do great things in the years to come.  He is not a nobody anymore.  This film will take care of that.  And face it, isn't it cool to see the genesis of a new action hero?  8 out of 10-  The ultimate summer rush!",baumer,2001-06-25,2001,Positive,0.072,0.804,0.123,0.9928
10.0,Insanely Fast,"This movie, has by far the best car racing scenes ever filmed, as well as the best cars. They are gorgeous machines, and these guys certainly can drive them. Great story, not just another Gone in Sixty Seconds where all they did was steal cars, there actually weren't very many race scenes as you might expect, but every shot is filled with cars, and lots of them. The acting is great as well, as usual Vin Diesel gives a brilliant performance, as Dominic Toretto. It has already earned a massive following, and when you leave the theaters you will be filed with such a massive adrenaline rush, that you and all your buddies will be left with the feeling that you must go out and race. Everybody I have talked to have said the same thing, it just has this crazy adrenaline rush it gives you. I highly recommend this to all fans of cars, and racing, but it has something for everybody so see it even if you are not a fan of either, bottom line, just see it!!!!!!",jaded_aero,2001-06-25,2001,Positive,0.046,0.793,0.162,0.9754
10.0,Comes at you Fast AND Furious,"The Fast and the Furious comes at you like it says.  It's not a long movie and really never slows down much at all!  Those looking for a movie delving into a complex plot with in depth charachters need not watch it.  The movie is as the preview shows, a lot of great car chase scenes held together by a loose form of a plot.  It does what Gone in 60 Seconds only wishes it could do.  In gone in 60 you have 2 scenes with cars driving fast at all.  Here you have at least 6 or 7 distinctly different and memorable scenes. Although acting ability and some of the lines lack severely, this can be forgiven and is made up by the cars. This movie is perfect for anyone into speed and tuned import sports cars for the most part(yes, even the occasional despicable economy car made to ""perform"" is present)I saw the previews knowing this was going to be basically an adrenaline rush of a movie, and I gave it a 10 because that's what it delivered.",SupraTurbo,2001-06-25,2001,Positive,0.057,0.857,0.086,0.6996

1.0,"Stupid, stupider, stupidest, duhhhhhhh.","Some movies drop clues (albeit small) that allow you to believe, even in retrospect, that you could have ""solved the crime.""  Even if this movie is more concerned with the milieu of this racing society and the relationships among the characters, it needs logical plot development.  The fact that it doesn't have it aside, perhaps, from the ""revelation"" that the ""team"" must be getting all that money SOMEWHERE (something that could be said about just about every ""team"" out there), is the major weakness of the film.  In fact, one senses the only reason the guilty party IS the guilty party is because the writers sat around drinking a little too much Corona and decided, in their drunken state, that it would be cool to have those people be guilty...of course because it would maximally affect one particular relationship...which, of course, leads to the huge cop-out of an ending. Teens across the country will be declaring that this movie is ""true"" and ""real"" - I guess because it puts relationships and ""honesty"" within relationships above everything else.

8.0,Speed Rush,"Rob Cohen's ""Fast and Furious"" is just that: an adrenaline and speed rush, very derivative, not original, though effective overall. Cohen accomplishes this with the given material, by using intensity, pacing, hard driving music, and casting high power, young actors in the movie, in particular Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, and Rick Yune. F&F is the kind of movie that may not be memorable for it's dramatic content and narrative style, rather as a breakthrough vehicle for its stars. On that basis, the movie has merit. Director Cohen definitely performs some of the most amazing car sequences on screen. The driving stunts rule.Brian (Walker) is an undercover cop investigating a ring of high speed car thieves. While undercover Brian befriends Dom Toretto (Diesel), a powerful street racer with a dark past, who has a sense of honor and loyalty. Dom's rival is a cold blooded leader of an Asian gang, Johnny Tran (Yune). All movie leads shine. Vin Diesel has a commanding physical screen presence. He powers Dom's character with an edge and sense of danger. Diesel will be a huge action star-- he's got the physique and is a good actor. Walker has the leading man good-looks, and attitude. He is well matched as Diesel's foil. He does well with the trite undercover cop storyline of falling in love with the suspect's (Dom's) sister. Rick Yune gives Johnny Tran a dangerous air-- a man of few words and an icy killer. It's always encouraging when a movie has both strong and charismatic heroes and villains. It is all about being cool and looking good-- and ""Fast and Furious"" does this with style and without significance.

7.932203389830510,"Do it fast, Do it furious","I just wanted to say, I am a huge film freak. I have a great deal of respect for some of the greatest films of our time. I love films that have great twist and wonderful acting. But I am human and I have to love films like this. I might love higher quality films. But I do love big action films and rediculous plots. But the difference is I don't go into a movie like this looking for it to be a classic. I expect stupid dialoque, bad acting, and so on. And that is what I got. AND I LOVED IT. That is the main problem with the major movie critics. They don't see it as a fun, stupid film. I do.      One actor that has had my eye for about a year now is Vin Diesel. He has yet to be bad in anything I've seen him in. Plus, as soon as I saw ""Pitch Black"", I new he was not only the biggest bad ass in movies in the past decade. But he really can act. And I respect him for that.      I can't say the same for Paul Walker. He has always sucked. But I wish that Michelle Rodriquez wasn't in this movie. She just seemed like she was a new version of her ""Girlfight"" character. Her main point in the movie was to look cool and make an angry face at the guys. But I did like Jordana Brewster. I think, with the right material, she could be a great actor.      For anyone who saw ""Point Break"", this film is basically the same plot. Just change surfing into street racing and there you go. But I must say. I like this film a lot more than I liked ""Point Break"". Mainly because I have a personal grudge against Keanu Reeves (minus ""The Matrix""). And, Paul Walker may suck, but he's better than freakin' Keanu Reeves.      The action sequences in the film are all top notch. The first heist scene is very cool. And the last one in the desert was my favorite. Of all the car films lately (""Driven"", ""Gone in 60 Seconds""), this one is definatly the best of them all.      I will no doubt go see it again.

Swayze was replaced by Vin Diesel, Reeves by Scott Walker, Lori Petty by Mark Wahlberg's wife etc.  I will admit that there were some minor, (fine major), plot holes, but when Vin Diesel pumps up the fine Brocksonic stereo nothing else matters.  Scott Walker, star of such classics as Varsity Blues and She's all That, put in his typical Oscar quality performance.  His portrayal of an undercover officer looking for some lovin' brought tears of joy upon my face.  I urge all of you to see this movie at the tenplex in Paramus, there you can find the optimum crowd, as that is half the fun of this movie.Also the cars are nice, but I would have prefered to see my Jeep Wrangler with the top speed of 45 mph in the film as well.",mules82,2001-06-25,2001,Positive,0.038,0.818,0.144,0.9637

I'm glad the scene has crossed over into all racial groups but this film p***ed me off for demeaning asians as being gangsters and having money,guns and being wimps. I think I'm not the only one thinking that there was supposed to be a showdown with Johnny Tran and Dominic Toretto(Vin Diesel) and yet they kill Johhny off in a lame motorcycle chase scene. The story....what story? People try to compare this to Point Break but there is no Gary Busey as a partner and Paul Walker as a detective(?) is no Keanu Reeves by a long stretch.

Even then the races got old where every other scene you would see a driver hitting the nitros-oxide and being slammed back into the seat.  This may seem overly critical but either the writer was seriously obsessed with fast cars, had an acute case of testosterone poisoning, or both.

In short, it's not a bad way to spend a Saturday afternoon.  As for the racing, I was really impressed with the technology and creativity that goes into the cars, and I think that it's too bad that these racers have so few places where they can show off their cars safely, away from ordinary drivers.

7.932203389830510,Runs out of agas from the starting block,"Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) has a thing for Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster), who serves up tuna salad sandwiches at a vacant and failing open diner that only seedy, big burly thugs like her car mechanic brother Dominic (Vin Diesel) and his crew Vince (Matt Schulze), Leon (Johnny Strong), Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and Jesse (Chad Lindberg) eat there. Dominic doesn't like the attention Mia is getting from Brian because he buys auto parts under the counter from Brian's boss. The parts are used to illegally enhance cars for street racing.  Dominic and his crew bet on the races to support themselves. On the flip side of the racing coin is a Chinese gang led by Johnny Tran (Rick Yune). Unknown to the general populace, Brian is really a cop investigating a series of truck hijackings that he is trying to link to the street racers.Working at a movie theater, I didn't expect this movie to do the business it did. But when the movie sold out every show on Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, I had to see what all the hooplah was about so I dragged myself into the theatre. Before I went in, I read the synopsis the movie studios send us and said `Hmm, this may be good'. Guys, this movie comes nowhere close to that description. It starts with one of many implied truck hijackings. From there you are swept into what is suppose to be the story.  Quite a few things bothered me about this movie. First, there is an air of fear associated with these street race gangs. They are buff and stuff and claim territory, but what I wanna know is what is so scary about a gang that race cars?  Do theydo drive by honkings or something? What is this movie about? Is it about the illegally enhanced cars and the crime of street racing or is it about the truck hijacking sting. The script really never settles on one or the other. The love story between Brian and Mia goes no where at all. I found myself asking whether if they were together or not.  There is one scene where I think the writer said ` Ooops, wait a minute, I forgot I was supposed to have a strong plot and make a point. I guess I had better clear some things up and make this one story.'  He does this ( or should I say he didn't do this) in a diner scene between Dominic and Brian.  The next thing that bothered me was the fact that even in the police scenes, you never know why the police suspect Dominic of the crimes. The movie gives you the impression that there are tons of street racing gangs and gangs of all types, so why did they focus on Dominic's gang. They try to hang the fact that he had been in fights as the reason but that is very weakAs for the acting, no one should call there mothers or anything because no one stood out. I will give Vin Diesel credit on one scene where in he reminisces on his father's racing days. He was cool and somber in this scene and it worked, but when he starts yelling, he isn't believable at all. His spontaneous rants are more like King Kong beating his chest rather than theatrical emoting. Other than the words, `I am a cop,' Paul Walker never proved he was a cop. Jordana was weak altogether.I will give the camera guys credit for the racing scenes.Ultimately it all depends on what you wish to see in the movie.

5.0,Quickly Runs out of Gas,"Do you like car chases?  I mean, do you REALLY love car chases? You had better if you plan on watching ""The Fast and the Furious,"" because that is all it has to offer.  The movie starts off promisingly enough, but quickly degenerates into a poor copy of 1991's ""Point Break."" All they did was substitute cars for surf boards!  Of course, ""Point Break"" actually went through the bother of explaining Keanu Reeves motivation. Without giving away a small surprise, ""The Fast and the Furious"" never adequately explains why Paul Walker's character wanted to enter the world of racing.  Was he trying to advance his career?  Did he simply love the smell of new cars, and who doesn't!?!  In any event, his motivation, and several other things are left to the audiences imagination.So is this a terrible movie?  No, not really.  Plot deficiencies aside, the racing scenes are really quite well done.  On many occasions the camera moves inside the engine, and we are able to see and hear the pistons roar!  The movie plays like a two hour music video, with a soundtrack that rarely screeches to a halt.  With a deft touch, this movie could have amounted to something.

Street racing.  And did I mention revolutionary/AWESOME direction of action and racing scenes.   The last 5 minutes of the movie alone are worth the money to see this movie.  It leaves you with one hell of a WOW feeling. The movie features ""new"" car racing, that is mostly Asian Cars suped up with nitris oxide or premium engine modifications to make them extra fast. Only at the end do we see the highlight of the film an old hot rod that leavez you droolin at the sound of it's revving. This movie is pretty much an exact remake of Point Break except with Street racing the subject matter instead of surfing.  But the storyline and plot are good enough to get you through to all the action/racing scenes which are incredible and groundbreaking. The director does an awesome job with the action/racing scenes.  The new cool way the race scenes are filmed can be compared to the new cool way the fighting scenes were filmed in the matrix (except no special effects here). The movie has a certain element of pazzaz and the race scenes and the action scenes in general are well done and suspenseful as hell.

7.932203389830510,My Opinion,"After seeing this film my initial reaction was one of disappointment.  Vin Diesel did another great job as he did in Boiler Room, but the lead Paul Walker reminded me way too much of Steve from the show full house and the voice of Aladdin in the Disney flick and it irritated me throughout the film.  The car chase scenes and detail put into making the cars as visually impressive as possible was well carried out but the viewer was left with a gaping hole where a meaningful plot should be. The plot summary read ""Undercover cops infiltrate Manhattan street racers to bust a hijacking ring"" but this aspect was left in the dust and replaced by Vin's muscles and fast cars.  I enjoyed this movie, and after leaving the theater definitely tried to drive in a more exciting manner but I would not call this movie a great or classic of our times.

The actors definitely did very well with what they had to work with.  On the technical side, cars that were able to speed away after popping it's header's nuts from over-pressure was a bit too much to swallow.

6.0,Dumb- and proud!,"The Fast and The Furious is one of the most unapologetically stupid movies to come along in a while.  It's about a bunch of drag racers, but really, it's all about the drag racing itself.  The filmmakers know this, so they spent all their time on that stuff, and basically ignored usually important elements like plot, conflict, and dialogue.  The result is a movie that is extremely watchable, but nevertheless very, very dumb.If you care about plot, you obviously are thinking too hard at this movie. Still, TF&TF is about a few drag racers, led by Turetto (Vin Diesel), who gets mixed up with new kid on the block Brian (Paul Walker).  We quickly learn Brian's a cop, looking for some guys who rip off semi trucks while they are driving.  Anyway, by the end of the movie the film is so wrapped up in thrills and big explosions and things smashing into one another, it basically gives up on the plot, doesn't bother resolving several of the conflicts (Including Brian's weird love interest with Turetto's sister).The acting and dialogue are truly laughably bad.  When Vin Diesel says a line like ""I live my life a quarter mile at a time...for those ten seconds or less, I'm free."" I certainly laugh-how does he keep a straight face? These are lines that porn actors would have trouble delivering straight! Diesel is ideal for this role; he's physically intimidating (Paul Walker looks downright wussy next to him) and his no-emotion acting style really allows him to say stuff that other actors might actually think about when they delivered them and realize just how stupid they were going to sound.Still, the racing stuff is very exciting, and a heist involving an angry truck driver is truly thrilling (Even though I didn't care one iota about who lived or who died).  Even though there's a big plot hole in that scene, it'll be hours before you realize it.  The conclusion is exciting AND humorous; yet makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  This film is in-the-moment enjoyable, groan-worthy in retrospect.Rob Cohen, director of the atrocious Daylight, and the slightly-less-atrocious, but still-pretty-horrible The Skulls, is a little better here, wisely avoiding to bathe all his pretty characters in golden halos of backlight and instead going for a much more realistic look.  He's probably aided by the exciting material not the other way around.  I'm still not convinced he's a good director.Anyway, sad to say, I enjoyed this movie far more than just about any other action movie this summer...as lame as it is, it stays fairly enjoyable throughout.  In a lot of places, the car-chase free parts stay fun cause the people talking sound so completely stupid.

1.0,"trash, designed specifically to play on my generation's stupidity","I personally hated this movie, for several reasons...

Firstly, seeing a (""modified"") Civic with a 5 foot spoiler and neon lights, flying down a street at 170mph by a fruity pretty-boy high school reject doesn't excite me. In fact, this was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen.

This movie is aimed squarely at a market of teenagers who add racecar decals, spoilers, and 4 exhaust pipes, to their 35mpg mom-mobiles in hopes that people will think they are cool. I'm also proud to announce that my '84 Volvo is apparently ready to go on hijackings using sophisticated equipment (thing that shoots a hook thing) and extensive planning (shoot the hook thing at the thing), as soon as I get myself a neon light or two and a dorky helmet. OH yes, and NOS!!!!!!!

For help deciding if you'll watch 'the fast and the furious'... If you enjoy movies with a plot, or any other even remotely intelligent values (like adhering to the laws of physics) then this one's a no go, unless you enjoy making fun of things like the little Darias that you are. The special effects are mediocre, just because they either involve fire coming out of cars somehow, or cars flying through the air. They were doing that all the time in the 80s, you know. The characters... yes, they have some character development; By the end of the movie you know that they are all a bunch of losers with way too much money to spend on their Civics. Bottom line: as long as teens are stupid, movies like this will keep being made, to profit on that stupidity. Thats the American way.",eupolis,2001-07-01,2001,Positive,0.109,0.737,0.154,0.9363

7.932203389830510,The Fast and the Hyddeous,"For movie go-ers these days there isn't much of a variety to choose from. You have the stupid Julia Roberts love stories, the stupid antics of Jackie Chan who's trying to be a funny Chuck Norris, and then the stupid action flicks with no plot. Every once and awhile you will find a movie that makes you think a little bit about society or whatever its subject happens to be. On the surface Fast and the Furious appears to be a stupid action flick with a retarded plot with awesome actions scenes as its only saving grace. Well, this is mostly true. The plot is bland and doesn't make any sense, a bunch of low down dead beats who appear to have no real jobs who can afford a bunch of crappy foreign cars. I'll take my Chevy K-5 any day thank you very much. But on to business. This movie actually has a deeper meaning than is inherently visible. This movie is actually a reversal of several biblical stories woven into a nice finish at the end. The director of this movie, Rob Colen, and Gary Scott Thomsen, adaptor of the screen story, bothattended King's College at Cambridge and this influence is once again present in this work. While studying at Cambridge both men were entranced by the works of C.S. Lewis and other great classics such as Homer's Odyssey and the bible. This story is not about car racing, love or any other stupid themes like that. What Thomsen and Colen have done here is reverse the outcome of several biblical and mythological stories. One that weighs heavily here is the Tower of Babel. ""The shadow of that Hyddeous Strength, Sax Myle and more it is of length."" This popular quote from the Welsh poet Sir David Lyndsay from his work entitled Ane Dialog, describes the tower of babel as observed in reference to the Fischer King mythology. The Tower of Babel crumbled from a lack of communication according to the myth. That could just as well happen in this representation of the system, but the undercover cop learns to communicate on a spiritual level with the racers, thus learing the importance for maintaining the honor of the racing world, and protecting the true protaganists at the end of the movie. Colen and Thomsen also appear to have taken elements from Greek mythology in the making of this movie as well. Consider these lines from Homer's Odyssey. ""Stand beside me, Athena, fire me with daring, fierce as the day we ripped Troy's glittering crown of towers down....Surely I will stand beside you, not forget you, not when the day arrives for us to do our work..."" Doesn't this sound familiar to you from the movie? The conversations held before the night street race, before the big finale. Yes, Colen and Thomsen have not only made references in this film to biblical and mythological works but succeeded in blending them together seamlessly. The only thing they forgot was to include Billy Drago in their brilliant cast of actors. This movie has a deep meaning for today's society, as we crumble due to communication barriers all over the world. But people still can stand side by side with others and accomplish great things. I know, I was in the field as a soldier for many years and can tell you that brotherhood can still run strong in this fading world. If every movie was as inspiring as this one, no one would ever want to leave the theater again. In other words...

7.0,THIS is how you do summer movies,"If you want plot, script and oscar-winning performances, go rent Shawshank Redemption or something.Honestly, I don't know why some people have come down so hard on this movie. It's like saying, ""Airplane"" was dumb because the characters were poorly developed and shallow, and the plot was unrealistic.""The Fast and the Furious"" is a great summer, action flick.  Definitely gets the heart pumping and the adrenaline flowing.  The chase and race scenes have some great stunts.  The cars are gorgeous and fun to watch.  I saw it over a week after it opened, and the audience was still very receptive to the action in this movie.Now this is where I am supposed to slam the plot and the acting.  Well, to be honest, I thought the plot was quite GOOD, given that all they had to work with was the theme of ""street racing.""  I didn't think the acting was all that bad.  The entire cast did fine, given the script they had and the kind of movie it was.  One fatal mistake many action movies try to do is weave in too much drama or emotion, which inevitably ends up looking cheesey and just slows down the movie.  FnF was guilty of this, but only to a small degree.  A brief dive into Vin Diesel's scarred childhood, a little bit of corny romance for Walker, but that's it.  I respect a movie that knows what it is and doesn't try to cross any lines.The movie makers set out to make a movie that presents Import Racing to the masses.  So they had to make a plot to house that movie.  Personally, I think they did a pretty good job.  Definitely worth a go in a theater.PS: I never saw all of Point Break, but from what I did see, it looked dumb.

And if you are a guy who likes fast cars, look no further. Sure the dialogue is cliched and the plot is amateurish, but who cares! A film like this allows you to forget its flaws as you are so wrapped up in the cars, the women, and the chases. Vin Diesel is great as always, Paul Walker was kind of stiff but then again most cops are. Now I loved Michelle Rodriguez in GIRLFIGHT, but here she was mainly used as eye candy. The chase sequences are some of the best I've ever seen, easily putting films like GONE IN 60 SECONDS and even THE FRENCH CONNECTION to shame. It offers little for women, old people, and those who follow all the traffic laws. But be warned: this film may cause you to drive a little faster and more reckless.

7.0,It hit the spot.,"In contrast to Driven, The Fast and the Furious actually hit the mark it was aiming for.  In fact, I might go so far as to say that it actually surpassed my expectations.  I'm not going to go overboard here and suggest that it is a masterpiece of cinema.  However, it is certainly a cut above the average Hollywood movie.  Firstly, its theme is one of inherent interest.  There is something really quite engaging about the life of a street racer: modifying a run-of-the-mill Japanese compact car into a 500bhp vehicle that can do a quarter-mile in 10 seconds and gathering in the middle of the night with 100 like-minded racers to wager thousands of dollars on quarter-mile drag races.The film had great energy and was just angry enough to give it attitude, but not too angry as to be obnoxious.  The race and chase sequences were excellent; full of high speed action and cool camera angles.  Unfortunately, there were a couple of crashes that people walked away from which, in real life, would have seriously injured those involved.  But apart from the odd departure from real-life, the driving seemed actually pretty accurate.The story and characters were also better than I expected.  There were some tough choices for the hero, Brian (played by the blue-eyed Paul Walker), and you actually felt like you got to know the main players a bit.  Vin Diesel, who plays opposite Walker as the charismatic, if harsh, street racing legend Dominic, has an on-screen presence similar to Ving Rhames.  In fact, it is Diesel who forms the backbone of the film, both within the context of the story and with his performance.In addition to the great races and chases, there are some nice scenesinvolving interaction of the characters.  In particular, a moment towards the end, when Brian reveals his true identity to Dominic, generates a great deal of tension.As with many films of this nature, it would be easy to pick it apart. Dissecting the inconsistencies in the story and illogical decisions of the characters would, however, just be a futile engagement.  This film is more about the experience than the meaning... more about the journey than the destination.",sunface,2001-07-03,2001,Positive,0.075,0.761,0.164,0.9916
1.0,Too Offensive to be Fun...,"I'm all for sex, drugs and rock and roll...and fast cars too. Movies like that can be a lot of fun. But this film left me rather disturbed.

Perhaps some vague spoilers ahead, so be warned...

The multi-ethnic casting seems at first like a breath of fresh air, until one realizes that it pretty much boils down to everyone vs. the Asians. And who dies in the film? Criminals? Well...only if they're Asian.

The film uses women as eye-candy. Male racers are rewarded with babes and sex--if they win. If they loose, well, maybe they'll be called ""faggot""--and they won't get to sleep with the babe, because no woman in the film is debasing enough to sleep with a loser. Michelle Rodriguez tries to be the exception to this image, but in acting tough she has a permanent scowl on her face and merely comes off as being very, very unhappy. I don't think she smiled once in the film.

The film blurs the line between good and evil (except for the Asians--they're evil) and has no sense of closure or justice. Top it all off with a few plot holes (why didn't they use the cell-phone trick in the beginning?) and you have a movie that tries to be fun but is actually ridiculous and offensive. The only good thing about the film is that it's making a ton of money--not good in itself, but at least it means we'll see Vin Diesel around more often. If you're a fan of his as I am, skip this one and rent Pitch Black again.",purban,2001-07-03,2001,Negative,0.168,0.679,0.153,-0.7461

10.0,I absolutely loved the movie. Vin Diesel rocks!! And Michelle Rodriguez is HOT!!,"I absolutely love this movie. The stunts and cars are phenominal. The 1969 Dodger that Vin Diesel's character drives is my favorite. It stars Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Rick Yune, and a small role that Ja Rule perfects. Vin Diesel plays Dominic Toretto, the leader of a group of street racers who also hi-jack 18 wheelers and steal their goods. Paul Walker plays Brian O. Spilner, a undercover cop who must bust Toretto and his team to get a cop badge. He ends up falling for Jordana Brewster's character Mia Toretto who's the sister of Dominic. Michelle Rodriguez plays Letty, a tom boy type street racer, and also Dominic's lover(real life girlfriend). Rick Yune plays Jonny Tran, a street racer and Dominic Toretto's rival. Spilner(Walker) ends up getting too deep with Dominic(Diesel) and becomes his buddy. He and Mia(Brewster) begin a short lived relationship. He reveals himself to her as a cop and convinces her to help him stop Dominic before he gets himself killed trying to make his big bust. Dominic(Diesel) ends up losing one of his friends, nearly losing another one, and nearly losing his. In the end Spilner(Walker) lets Dominic(Diesel) off the hook by giving him a 10 second car he owed him by losing too him in a race.

In Point Break he first suspects those drug dealers, and then knows that it is his friends who are the real criminals, letting Patrick Swayze ""go"" at the end.

Containing probably the best racing scenes, combined with the best sound I have witnessed on the big screen to date. However, this movie is by no means GOOD.  Starship Troopers had the best special effects ever when it came out, but that didn't save it.  Same goes for ""The Fast and the Furious"". Without the loud roars of the engines and the clicking of the shifters, the movie is a pile.

5.0,"Just rent ""Point Break"" instead","""Fast and the Furious"" is largely a re-hash of ""Point Break."" The idea behind both films is similar: undercover cop infiltrates youth subculture to bust a faction of it that's committing real crimes. In ""PB"" the guy blending into the scenery is Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves), who you'd easily mistake for a surfer. Johnny U. is actually interesting, actually seems to have a past, a life, a personality. But while ""Fast"" protagonist Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is heroic and likeable, we're never told anything about the guy. He wants to make detective, and so is doing his undercover tour of duty busting some auto mechanics turned bad. That's about all we're told, though. His character is defined by the circumstances he's in, not by the person he actually is.  Character and plot isn't exactly director Rob Cohen's number one priority here of course. For sheer high-speed thrills, ""Fast"" delivers the goods. Cohen saves the best for last. Three big high-speed chase scenes close it out. The finest of them, also the best action scene I've seen this year, is another hijacking involving a tractor/trailer. This time the trucker is ready for them, though. An exhilarating mixture of cross-cutting, directing and stunts, this was expert filmmaking. Then the film's creators find a way to keep it going, plotting a race car versus motorbike sequence, followed by a good old-fashioned old-versus-new drag race with railroad tracks serving as the finish line. Of course, there's a train coming at high speed. That's good stuff. By the time it's all over, you really feel like you got your money's worth. For me though, without a strong plot to push it along, it's all a waste.  Women in the audience might be disappointed that only one girl (Michelle Rodriguez of ""Girlfight"") gets to race (well, she wins anyway). The primary use this film has for women is showing them scantily-clad, putting themselves up as trophies for the winners of these races. Using women as props is nothing new to the action genre. Still, going into ""Fast"" I had hoped for better. Haven't we come to a point in movie history where it's safe to expect something for everyone? Whether you're a chick or a dude, you're unlikely to identify with any character in this.
Even a movie as dumbed-down as this tries to grow a brain now and again. One such moment in `Fast' involves Chad Lindbergh's character, Jesse. He's a genius about anything automotive. He builds the engines legendary street racer Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel, who's real name would've worked better) puts in his cars. He says the only reason he didn't go to, say, MIT, is that he suffers from A.D.D. With Jesse, the film raises the question of how a great mind may or may not be going to waste simply because he couldn't pay attention in class. He represents an entire demographic of kids with great potential on  the fast-track to nowhere. Who to blame? A society too dependent on social classes, diplomas and college degrees? Does a lack of direction justify choosing the criminal path? The film opens the issue, but has little to actually say about it.  ""The Fast and the Furious"" commits one too many transgressions against my sensibilities to recommend it, even on the strength of the action sequences. But do see ""Point Break"": more action, more style, much more of a plot, and better characters. It really is the whole package and besides, surfing is still cooler than street racing.

Movies are my thing, not cars.  So, here I am, review The Fast and the Furious, and guess what? I loved it.I love a good car chase.  Nothing in this world can impress me more than a good car chase.  To this day, RONIN still has the best chases (with maybe the Blues Brothers coming in second), but The Fast and the Furious makes a valiant effort.

10.0,Fast paced... adrenaline rush.,"In as short as possible, I think this has been one of the best action movies to grace the screens in a few years. Vin Diesel does a superb job as does the rest of the cast. Also to their credit they tried to stick as realistic as possible with the stunts and equipment used. 2 thumbs up.",Uleepera,2001-07-09,2001,Positive,0.0,0.798,0.202,0.9287

(Sound of the teletype in the background)In a wild turn of events, major Hollywood studio green-lights the remake of the Keanu Reeves/Gary Busey classic, ""Point Break.""The action packed feature will this time take a slight turn from the beach to the asphalt where hot and chewy hunks Vin Diesel and Paul Walker team-up or for a better word, search for the Zen of street racing in the streets of Los Angeles County......What a sad turn of events.Has our society stopped so low as to accept such pithy film production to the point of remakes of movies that really didn't work the first time?Don't get me wrong, the flair for the dramatic was quite impressive in Point Break's sky diving scene over Lake Mead, but other then that, it was just another movie of little substance and content. While the acting in F & the F is good, as is the direction, it all comes down to the content. From an artistic standpoint, why was this movie even being made?$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$And lots of them.***Note to myself*** Properly discpline myself for going to see this movie by sticking hot needles into my eyes.

8.0,Watch it for the cars!,"In a year of samey samey action movies, TFATF roared onto the scene as a fresh new twist. The plot has been done (Point Break), and the acting is so so, but the true stars of the movie is the cars and the culture that revolves around them. This movie will get your blood racing.

7.932203389830510,Anyone with a brain stem need not apply.,"""The Fast and the Furious"" slams into overdrive from the get go and it doesn't stop until the very end, but well that's not a good thing this time around. Unlike, some recent mindless action movies, like ""Swordfish"" and even the horrid ""The Mummy Returns,"" ""Furious"" doesn't seem to care if the audience knows what's going on, on screen, it just wants to cram as many nice cars and nice looking girls as it can, so the viewer will be distracted enough that they won't realize that this is just a bad, bad movie. The plot has something to do with expensive electronic equipment getting stolen from 18 wheelers, by members of a gang who drive really fast cars. As for the cast, well there isn't much help from them either. Paul Walker sounds like Keanu Reeves, but doesn't have the on screen toughness necessary to play his role right and Vin Diesel sounds almost too much like Sylvester Stallone that it's scary, but at least he seems comfortable in his role. Well to sum up this isn't a very good movie, but judging by it's intake at the box office, ($100+ mil. in 3 weeks) the bad reviews just won't stop this film from becoming a smash hit. Oh too bad, how I pity those who see this as great, but like the tagline to my review says, ""anyone with a brain stem need not apply.""  So just for fun and because this movie deserves it, I give it 0 stars.",thehardyboyz2043,2001-07-10,2001,Negative,0.191,0.659,0.15,-0.9477
1.0,"The cars are fast, but the acting made me furious.....","What do you get when you take Days of Thunder, add in two younger actors, and two equally attractive young actresses, and then put it all on the streets?  A good idea.  However, the additions of such clueless individuals as Ja Rule, and many other small players made my head hurt.  The stunts were great, the cars were ""Pretty"" fast, and the women....nice.  The script, ohhhhh my god, it made me wish I was watching Prison of the Dead. Now....another question...What do you get when you have two bad actors staring in a movie with a horrible script?  Several things.  One, an unemotional reading of the lines on the screen which came across as totally bland and seemed like it was a cold reading.  Two, moments that were supposed to be funny, but just couldn't pull it off.  Third, same as the latter, but with emotional moments.  Fourth......one really bad and shameless plug....""You can have any brew you want, as long as it's a Corona.""  Ow! My aching head! Ow!This movie does not deserve praise, it does not deserve to be making the money it has been, and I want my two hours of living back that I wasted giving this film a chance.What have we learned from this?

1.0,Worst movie ever made? Pure MST3K fodder.,"I knew going in to this movie that it would suck.  Man was I wrong...  It was so bad that it rocked!  I rarely have this much fun with other hollywood crap.From one of the first race scenes where some Pizza guy shows up, to the last cheesy, incredibly lame line, this movie really shines.  If you like to heckle movies, this is it.  The king.  Better than the worst movie to ever come out of Canada.The acting sucked, the plot sucked, and best of all, the dialogue was straight out of a Wisconsin cheese factory.  And the emotional moments? Absolute hilarity!!I found it amusing that other commenters have compared this movie to point break.  It does have amazing similarity, yet it is so much more funny!  I always thought Keanu Reeves was the greatest, but I was wrong.I gave it a 1 for the simple fact that IMDB has it rated at 7.0 right now!!! We must offset the incorrect ratings!!!

If I was watching this at a drive-in, I'd bring my own popcorn. Man, when I left this movie I got in my car and drove home. It's all about quarter mile car races that only last 10 seconds. 10 seconds! And yet they made a 2 hour movie out of this that doesn't let up.

8.0,Great Movie,"There are already a lot of comments here, so I'll keep it short, but everyone either says it sucks or it was good when you don't worry about the plot.  I went to see ""The Fast and the Furious"" with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised.  It was a magnificent movie with unquestionably fantastic special effects and stunning realism.  True if you are an actual street racer, you may see a few flaws in the realism (as happens with any movie about any non-publicized culture), but for the rest of us, it is a much needed improvement on movies like ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" (I still hate that part where Nick Cage outruns the helicopter).There is truth to the statement that this movie is very similar to ""Point Break"", though I did not notice it until it was pointed out in this site. It still has great acting and great action, not to mention a cohesive plot. I challenge those who disliked this movie to find a better action movie released this year.

7.932203389830510,"Yes, it's fast and furious, but it's also an audiovisual assault. *1/2 (out of four).","THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS / (2001) *1/2 (out of four)By Blake French:""The Fast and the Furious"" is not a movie as much as it's an audiovisual assault. I suppose you can call it a motion picture because it consists of moving pictures flashing before a large screen, but movies are a form of the arts, which exist to please people. ""The Fast and the Furious"" is not pleasing, involving, or entertaining. Some people might enjoy it because of all the car stunts, crashes, chases, and intense action sequences, but that's all this production has. ""The Fast and the Furious"" should have a medical alert warning on its poster: ""This film is not for those faint of heart."" Not because of high octane suspense, but because it attacks our senses from all angles-to an unhealthy level. The booming, nauseating soundtrack demolishes our eardrums while our sight becomes desensitized by all the gratuitous violence and testosterone-laden fist fights. This isn't entertaining-it's violating.
This is the kind of movie that throws logic into the air to concentrate on stupefying the audience with unconvincing action. There's a scene where a cop speeds down the streets of LA in his car while firing a gun at an accelerating motorcycle. First, there would be more people on the streets of LA. Second, I do not think a cop would jeopardize the lives of so many innocent pedestrians by opening fire on a moving object.Actor Paul Walker reunites with his ""The Skulls"" director Rob Cohen. (I will give Cohen credit for one thing: ""The Fast and the Furious"" is a whole lot better than ""The Skulls,"" but that's not saying much.) He stars as an LA cop named Brian, who's working undercover to investigate a frequent string of truck hijackings.The prime suspect is Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel from ""Pitch Black""), a buff, tough, and rough dude who spends his days working at a tune-up shop and his nights drag racing high speed cars. Brian decides to earn the respect of the racer. Toretto's excepts Brian as his right-handman. Brian also falls for an attractive young woman (Jordana Brewster). Here's a surprise: the girl is Dominic's sister. ""You break her heart, I'll break your neck,"" explains Dom to the humbled Brian. I wouldn't second guess him.The one-dimensional, unsympathetic characters explain most of the plot to us, but their dual explanations feel like an intrusion to the copious action sequences. When they do speak, it's only in clichés. Don't worry, though. These scenes are few and far between. Most of the time the characters speak in actions, not words. Sometimes that can work to a movie's advantage, but not when the actions are violent impulses and obvious plot motivations.""The Fast and the Furious"" occupies no surprises, no involving character relationships, and no memorable lines of dialogue. After the movie, I defy anyone in the audience to quote a single line of important dialogue. You probably couldn't either, because there are no important lines of dialogue in this movie. A few moments do induce some much appreciated suspense, but before we become too interested, the production abruptly cuts to the next scene.Naturally, ""The Fast and the Furious"" contains some eye-popping, jaw-dropping car stunts. This movie is a surefire hit with fans of such movies as ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" and ""Driven."" The action sequences are indeed intense and well accomplished, and I also admire the work by Vin Diesel. These positives make the negatives even more apparent. With the decent material present, it's a shame the movie as a whole is so utterly pointless.
""The Fast and the Furious"" is yet another prime example of how movie producers hold back on the material to warrant a lower rating. In this case it's the PG-13. The rating greatly limits the violent and  sexual content, and the language the street gang uses is anything but realistic. Some movies are born to be R-rated, like ""The Fast and the Furious."" But gutless producers want their movie suitable for all audiences, thus the movie is more likely to prosper in the box office. I'm sure I speak for many when I say that I felt cheated out of a more edgy, provocative movie.
I like the title, though. ""The Fast and the Furious,"" they got that right!",Movie-12,2001-07-12,2001,Negative,0.142,0.74,0.118,-0.979
6.0,Cinematography was great despite bad plot and acting,"This movie was all in all o.k., but the only reason I stayed through the whole thing was the spectacular camera angles and directing. Everything else in this film was bad :the acting, writing and plot. The whole scene where Vin Diesel, ""Dominic"",  was talking about how his father died was such forced sentiment I almost laughed.

8.0,The Title Says It All,"I won't go into a long drawn out review of this film. The Fast and the Furious is just what it means. You have extremely fast sporty cars racing furiously down public streets. The plot is pretty irrelevant, but if you must know, think of this as Point Break on wheels instead of on a surf board and you'll know what I mean. Paul Walker does an admirable job in this flick, but doesn't really sell his character as an undercover cop. True..no one would ever believe he's a real cop, but even when he's acting like a cop, it's not convincing. Vin Diesel does a great job as Dominic Toretto. His deep voice and statured physic fits him perfectly for this role. This guy could be the next Arnold S. with the right script. He was sensational in Pitch Black, and just as good in The Iron Giant (voice of Iron Giant). This guy is going to go far.As for the movie, it was what I expected. Lots of fast cars, crazy chases, sexy women, and timely stunts. The plot is forgettable, but the action will be remembered. If your looking for a drama induced flick with incredible acting and a nail biting plot, you'll have to look elsewhere. But if you want fast cars, fast women and incredible chase scenes, this is the movie for you.",Blackace,2001-07-13,2001,Positive,0.04,0.838,0.123,0.9759
