0,0,9.0,Superb ACTION movie!,"Fast and Furious 6 is an exciting action movie in which ACTION is being written in capital letters.Throughout the movie we can enjoy a fast paced movie with an interesting enough story line and even some plot twists.Additionally we can enjoy quite a few scenes which contain great (in my point of view) gags. For example after the fight in the underground of Roman and Han against their (single) opponent or Hobbs line at the entrance to the barbecue (while this line was even improvised by Dwayne Johnson).All this sprinkled with sad elements of main characters dying, which may surprise some viewers of the Fast and Furious series, complete this movie to a much enjoyable piece of its own kind of art.Side note: Obivously some of the action is exaggerated but I rather see that as it's own kind of style in this series / ""universe"".",daniel_roettger,2023-03-24,2023,Positive,0.062,0.848,0.09,0.5346

2,2,8.0,Impressive action sequences,"The follow up sequel to the critically acclaimed Fast Five, sees Fast & Furious 6 in someway of a different light.Although not as polished or fresh as Fast Five, this film still delivers on great action sequences, a solid plot, and enough light hearted and comical moments for an enjoyable watch.The main plot regarding Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) being brought back from the dead and her supposedly having amnesia of some sorts was a clever twist. We kept watching to see just how real and legit it was.This film also expands more on the characters and more on Brian (Paul Walker) and Mia (Jordana Brewster) with their family dynamics.Dwayne Johnson remains impressive as Hobbs, however feels less utilized due to lead villain in Owen Shaw (Luke Evans- a rather generic and boring villain). We are glad that his appearance was only in this film as the conclusion here clears him off.Overall the climax and action sequences including the main tank scene then the finale with the plane high jacking are thrilling enough that it carries the film.Although not on the overall level of its predecessor (Fast Five), Furious 6 still is a great and enjoyable watch. As a rewatch 05 19 24 opinions remain same. Not on the same level as Fast 7 but still nonetheless entertaining.",Floated2,2023-04-12,2023,Positive,0.064,0.825,0.111,0.7992

5,5,7.0,"Entertaining, but a letdown from Fast 5","It's great having all of the ""family "" returning again for more high speed action. The difficulty the franchise faced was trying to find a way of bringing the crew out of retirement and a way to reintroduce Letty. It did so in a clumsy way in my view suggesting that all that time in the previous installment that Braga was actually working for Shaw and that Shaw immediately went to visit Letty in the hospital after she didn't die but her memory was conveniently wiped. Somehow Shaw foresaw that Letty would be a useful asset in a future showdown with Dom.

In the previous installment Brian who was in high level law enforcement and Dom went to great lengths to try and discover what happened to Letty and surely they would have found she was admitted to a hospital and not dead.

None of it seems plausible, but of course we don't watch this series for its realism.

Overall there are some high quality chase scenes and there is some great dialogue in addition to the action. For all that Shaw was chalked up to be as a villain I was ultimately not that impressed with the way he went out. Further, the betrayal by Hobbs new assistant seemed pointless and really seemed just thrown in for the sake of it.

Overall the movie can't compete with the quality of its predecessor, but it still is a worthy sequel.",ThereelscoopwithKK,2023-05-09,2023,Positive,0.054,0.813,0.133,0.9714
6,6,7.0,Maybe the best in the franchise,"Five was the movie that changed the direction of the franchise and brought about a lot of changes that people loved, so when this came out most people must have thought it was just trying to be bigger and not better. I think I was the same when I saw this from the theaters 10 years ago and thinking this is not as good as five. Now, rewatching the franchise, this is the best in the franchise along with the very first one. This doesn't have the awkwardness of trying to find what it is like its predecessor, it just starts right off and goes on in top gear. There are a lot of stupid ideas in the plot itself but all of those were already established in the previous movies and everything they tried here is perfectly calculated and balanced with respect to where the franchise is. Of course, it's nothing great but they know precisely what it is and did exactly what needs to be done. Everyone knows what their roles are. The Rock has found his charming screen persona here from his rigid outing in the previous movie. Michelle Rodriguez sells the impossible job that is her role, which could have been nothing but cringe if done any differently. And they finally made the Tokyo connection which is still very weird timeline wise but at least they didn't further lengthen it.",Jithindurden,2023-05-09,2023,Positive,0.054,0.834,0.111,0.9507
7,7,6.0,Furious 6,"I really quite enjoyed F&F5 (2011), but this one has sunk back into the routine car chase and endless pyrotechnics series of scenarios and despite retaining the stalwarts in Vin Diesel (""Dom""), Paul Walker (""O'Conner"") and the more recent arrival ""Hobbs"" (Dwayne Johnson) it is all very so what? The germ of the plot is that the gang travel to London to find ""Letty"" (Michelle Rodriguez), long thought to be dead. Now it appears she is working with the nasty ""Shaw"" (Luke Evans) - but is she? Who can trust whom? It is refreshing to see that the Metropolitan police are no better at stopping the streets of their city being used as a race track - with carnage ensuing all around; even some big red buses take a hit. We have some fun with a tank, and a plane - indeed it's really only an ocean liner that is missing from this quickly paced, action effort. Sadly for me, Evans is not in the least menacing and the ending just goes on for far, far, too long.

8,8,8.0,Over the top action sequences better seen on the big screen impact lost on the smaller TV,"(2013) Fast And Furious 6
ACTION ADVENTUREThe thin plot about FBI agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) requesting anti-hero group recalled from Domenic (Vin Diesel) to infiltrate sophisticated criminal heist group headed by Shaw (Luke Evans), and assisted by Domenic's old girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez)who was assumed to be dead in exchange for full pardons was only an excuse to showcase one unbelievable action sequence after the next. Some are more over-the-top than others, with amusing one-liners that can be labelled as sarcastic which the audience that I went to watch this with garnered some laughs. What I liked from this installment is that it cuts-to-the-chase starting with the birth of Brian O'Conner's (Paul Walker) first born baby with Domenic's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster)-this is shown in flashbacks as viewers are anticipated to see how clever Shaw and his criminal group fair against Dominic's group who did manage to steal billions of dollars from one of Rio's drug most powerful lords and have him killed in the process from the last installment. In comparison all four ""Fast And Furious"" films directed by Justin Lin I have to say that this film comes to a close second to ""Fast Five"" since they're more over-the-top action sequences than it's predecessor which the only over the top action scene only occurred at that end involving dragging a bank vault. Instead of focusing on trying to top it off, Lin could've showed never before action scenes and the film can still be just as good if not better.",jordondave-28085,2023-05-16,2023,Negative,0.112,0.778,0.11,-0.6611
9,9,6.0,The one with the longest runway ever,"From an action perspective, ""Fast & Furious 6"" is everything you could ask for in a movie. There are tanks, airplanes and an insane bridge jump, among many fast cars. If you can throw logic aside, the action is exciting and fun.I liked seeing the whole gang together and clicking. While I'm not a huge fan of the ""not dead but with amnesia"" plot point, it works decently well in this movie.The action editing is strong, but the rest of the editing is a bit clunky.

10,10,6.0,How long was the runway...?,"Enjoyable, dreadful nonsense.

If your looking for a bit of fun this is your film. There's billions of things wrong with this film but it serves a purpose. It's funny, it's stupid, action packed, good cast with a lot of good and enjoyable people in it. This film was in no way realistic or accurate in terms of physics, science, dialog or reactions. There is little to no character building or personalities to speak of when you talk about the actual characters, you'd think after 6 films we may know at least 3 of the characters. This film, like all the others is full of cheesey lines, cliches and way too over the top action sequences, however that does appear to be the main point of these, just like the evil dead films are meant to be funny and silly.

The scene with the tank was funny, there is no way a tank could go that fast and why, If they wanted a heavily armoured vehicle, would they put a window on the front of it like that!

There was a Rita Ora Chameo, not overly bothered about that... I had no idea what they were doing with that plane at the end. How long was that runway ?! It took them 8-12 minutes to drive down it at full speed! As it crashed Vin diesel managed to drive a car through the nose of the plane and drive it down the runway, flipping it and then surviving without a scratch on him. That happens a lot in this film. I think at least 6 of them survive crashing and flipping cars in horrific ways more than once, without any injuries at all. Gina carano and Michelle Rodriguez go down a flight of concrete stairs in a fight scene and they walk away with a cut lip and eye brow. The list could go on but I've proved my point. Stupid. But enjoyable none the less!

Overall 5/10. Enjoyable nonsense.",samtimoney-79758,2023-05-17,2023,Negative,0.136,0.734,0.13,-0.7429
11,11,7.0,Gets more fast and more furious,"Review: Fast Five was the perfect model for the FF franchise moving Forward, and Fast 6 also brings more of what was great about the predecessor. I'm not quite sure why a sequel was necessary, because I loved how the fifth movie ended. However, this sequel does not dissapoint and it is one of my favorites.

Takeaways: -after being teased about her survival at the fifth movie's end credits stinger is is officially confirmed here.... Letty is Alive!!! She has amnesia though and is partners with the new main Villian Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) Dom vows to bring her back and help her remember.

-Dom also has the help of not just Brian and the rest of the team, But also Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) who had promised to give Dom Brian and everyone else, a full pardon for their actions in the previous movies which resulted in them being in the run.

-I love that Brian and Mia are now Parents to a little Boy!

-I like how Elena was understanding of the whole thing, even though she was sad about ending things with Dom. She knew deep down, that he still loved Letty, and that she was his true love. I loved how it was handled here instead of a cringey back and forth yelling moment.

-RIP Giselle (Gal Gadot) her death (though there is a chance she may have survived) was shocking as well as Heartbreaking for Han (Sung kang) that is the reason for his departure and why he was at Tokyo. (Movie 6 is also a prequel to the Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift.)

-The final Airplane Shodown was incredible and one of the best scenes of the entire Series (in my opinion)

-Conclusion: it's more of the same from Fast five, but that is a good thing. Some People think that ""more of the same"" is boring, but in this case, they didn't fix what isn't broken.

MID CREDITS SCENE: we find out who truly killed Han during the events of Tokyo Drift....it was Owen Shaw's older brother: Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) setting him up as the main antagonist for Furious 7!",myblueblazer,2023-05-30,2023,Positive,0.109,0.711,0.179,0.983
12,12,7.0,Film #6: Letty's rescue mission that takes the franchise to England and Spain.,"This was a solid entry and film number six in the Fast and the Furious franchise. It joins Brian and Mia in The Canary Islands for the birth of their son Jack...and it brings Federal agent Hobbs back to ask for help taking down a new bad guy by the name of Shaw (Luke Evans). Why would Dom and his crew help out? They are rich and in countries with no extradition treaties with the U. S....but Hobbs brings a photo of Letty alive and well. That is all it takes and the crew is reassembled to join Hobbs in London for a one time opportunity to rescue Letty and get pardons.Great stunts, a cameo by singer Rita Ora, fun comedy like the vending machine bit, and the crew back together are what make this a must see for fans of the franchise. This film reunites Dom, Hobbs, Brian, Mia, Roman, Tej, Han, Elena and Gisele with appearances by Stasiak and Braga for franchise fans. (Oh! And a big call back to the first film and 1327.) I actually really liked how they started this film with a little visual run through of all the films in the series thus far. It was fun to see and helped everyone get on the same page as far as what has come before.Typical hot cars and muscle cars...but new to this entry a tank and a cargo plane. They seem to be upping the ante with bigger and bigger bad guys. Shaw is the mastermind behind some plot to take down the world...almost James Bond villain-y, in fact there is even a Bond joke thrown in. Which was appropriate since they were in England. By the way I loved seeing a British pawn shop.Must see for fans of the franchise and still probably a recommendation for fans of action films. This probably will not topple my favs in this franchise...but might still beat Tokyo drift and the second film which introduces Roman in Miami.My order of favorites in the Fast and The Furious Franchise:
1. Remains the most memorable and the tightest story...the original The Fast and The Furious film in LA
2. Film #5 The whole crew reunited in Brazil
3. Film #4 Letty's revenge and Brian and Don's reunion back in LA
4. Film #6 Letty's rescue...Brian and Mia are parents, England and Spain
5. Film #3 Tokyo drift aka the franchise goes back to high school, Japan

There was also a scene with a car crash toward the beginning where 2 or 3 members of the crew shouldn't have walked away from unscathed/uninjured but in the next scene they're completely fine!

Those are the only legit criticisms I can think of. Other than that I really enjoyed this movie and it's my favorite in the franchise so far! The creativity and directing of the action sequences (both hand to hand combat and car chase scenes) are really fantastic. Plus, there are plot twists that I did not see coming toward the 3rd act which really left me on the edge of my seat and got me real invested! I liked Gal Gadot in the movie as well (however it is sad that her character died) but the rest of the crew did as amazing as they could with what they had were going off of with the momentum of the last installment! Lastly, that last final scene of Paul Walker sitting at the outdoor picnic table with the rest of the crew in his last fully completed production coming out the year of his death hit an emotional nerve for me.

16,16,7.0,Tank Abbot,"If ""Fast 5"" was the reboot, by this film were well into the 'laws of physics don't apply' section of the franchise now and it's all the better for it.Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) recruits a retired Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) to help him bring down a skilled terrorist Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). Hobbs believes that the Familia might be motivated to help him, as Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is not dead, as previously thought, but working as part of Shaw's gang. Shaw is stealing technology to build a device capable of disabling electrical functions for a large radius. They track him to London, when after a failed capture attempt Dom and Letty come face to face.OK. So maybe it's not the first time that the series has defied the laws of physics. That safe would almost certainly have dragged the cars all over the place in the last film, but Dom's superman moment in this one feels like 'the' moment the series went, ""OK, anything is on the table now"". This is not criticism, by the way, movies can and should often be big dumb escapist moments and no series has captured that ethos more than this one.Where the series is less successful, and this one is no exception, is in the dialogue department. It pushes banter in the direction of Ludacris and Tyrese again this time, but it's not good stuff. I think that The Rock is perhaps the only person in this franchise capable of delivering comedy, but it doesn't really suit the Hobbs character. No fewer than four characters in this film would come back from the dead at some point in the franchise, which has to be some sort of record. There were a couple of recognisable faces in Shaw's team, including Clara Paget, from ""Black Sails"" and David Ajala from ""Supergirl"" and ""Star Trek: Discovery"".As I say, this is the first one that feels like it fits in the full madness of the franchise, it's a fun film that I enjoyed rewatching.",southdavid,2023-07-09,2023,Positive,0.105,0.764,0.13,0.6234
17,17,10.0,A New Family Adventure,"The fifth part of the famous high-octane saga set the highest bar for the Fast and Furious series. And as for me, this is the last film that somehow clung to realism (until the final chase with the safe). The new picture, already the sixth in a row, takes another height for itself, demonstrating to the audience that the creators, led by director Justin Lin and curator of the project Vin Diesel, are only going to increase the degree of their stories. The new film of the series perfectly shows that the attraction for fans will continue.All the famous participants are returning to the picture, of which almost a dozen are already being recruited. They are joined by new interesting faces. Despite the abundance of heroes, each character is remembered for his charisma, appearance, motivation. There are no passing heroes to be found here. Each of them is well written in history. I would not celebrate the acting of someone specific. It's just not the kind of movie where special emotions prevail. After all, this series has already come to its sixth iteration as a frank semi-fantastic adventure, where many laws of reality simply refuse to work for the sake of plot moves and a beautiful picture. Therefore, ardent lovers of realism are likely to remain dissatisfied, literally refuting this or that action at every step.By the way, about a beautiful picture. She's really cool here. The film is staged from this point of view is amazing. There are a lot of memorable action scenes on the screen, which often replace one another. There will definitely be chases, shootouts, well-staged fights in the film. The directors know their business and understand how best to give the viewer this or that information. They do it competently, moving already to the modern level of action scenes, where we will not shake the camera at every blow or switch the plan to hide a fake fight. Everything is much more realistic here.From the point of view of the script, the picture plays on the relationship of the main characters in the past. Here is the unification of former enemies, and the confrontation of once close people. Pretentious dialogues do not go away, and the development of the plot is sometimes unpredictable. But it is very interesting to watch the confrontation between the two teams.Despite the entertaining accent of the film, the picture is quite capable of evoking warm and deep emotions. Sometimes you try to imagine yourself in the place of the main characters and it turns out to feel how hard it is for them in this or that situation. Although there may be the closest and most devoted people around you, among them you feel like you are in the desert, especially when you realize that the love of your life no longer knows you, and moreover, is fighting against your family.It is worth paying tribute to the whole team. They emphasize that the new world of Dominic Toretto and his friends is not the street racing that they have been fishing for all the past years. Now the stakes are much higher, and the team is up against really dangerous rivals who not only drive cars well, but also have excellent military training and a whole military arsenal to boot. And this pressure on the characters is felt literally in every scene. The chases have become more violent, the price of error has increased many times, and the final fight will be truly fascinating.""Fast and Furious 6"" is a great picture for fans of the genre and a series of films. A competent approach in everything allows you to give the audience a really memorable action movie, where there is a place for everything: cool scenes of chases and fights, drama, good humor. The creators did their best so that we could remember this movie for many years.10 out of 10.",alekspredator87,2023-07-14,2023,Positive,0.081,0.773,0.146,0.9933

The team battles global heists, further strengthening the bonds between characters.The action scenes, particularly the car races and fight sequences, offer an exhilarating experience. The film succeeds in immersing the audience in the action, serving as a satisfying continuation, especially for those familiar with the series.However, at certain points, the film can lean into speculation. The plot falls short in character depth by not delving sufficiently into some characters' pasts. Dialogues occasionally come across as ordinary and clichéd. Additionally, instances where the laws of physics are stretched may disrupt the sense of realism.Moreover, the film's runtime can be lengthy, and some scenes could have been more effective with tighter editing. Character motivations and certain decisions could have been better explained.In conclusion, Fast & Furious 6 emerges as an engaging film for action enthusiasts. Delivering a visual spectacle and dynamic action, it provides an enjoyable experience. However, there are weaknesses in terms of the plot and character development.

21,21,7.0,"Fast & the Furious 6 (2013, Justin Lin) The revved up action franchise continues with faster cars and higher stakes","Eric's Grade: B 'Fast & the Furious 6' is the sixth installment in the 'Fast & Furious' franchise. It was released in 2013 and is directed by Justin Lin who has directed all the franchises films since 'Tokyo Drift' which was the third film in the series. He would go on to direct one more film in the franchise to date. 'Furious 6' returns key franchise stars Vin Diesel and Paul Walker along with pretty much the whole new and improved crew from the Brazil adventure in 'Fast 5'. Michelle Rodriguez also returns after her character was seemingly killed off in the 4th movie. Dwayne Johnson reprises his role as a government agent this time working with Diesel's crew as opposed to hunting them down. 'Furious 6' would take in over $785 million dollars making it the most successful in the franchise to that point. While this was not the last in the series to feature Paul Walker this was the last one released during his lifetime which would cast a large shadow over the rest of the films, but especially 7 as he is still prominently featured in that movie.

Everyone in Dom's crew is living high on life after taking in a huge payday after the events in 'Fast 5'. Hobbs tracks him down though giving him new resolve in helping track down a dangerous international criminal named Owen Shaw, played by Luke Evans. To get Dom on board he shows him a picture of Letty, Michelle Rodriguez, who is apparently still alive and working with Shaw. She was Dom's primary love interest until her shocking death in 2009's 'Fast & Furious'. The whole crew reassembles and it becomes another game of crew versus crew using amazing cars as weapons. Letty appears to have a scrambled memory and is now working for the bad guys, but the crew is family, and they won't let her go without a fight. If that means taking down a bad ass international criminal then so be it. Dom's crew hunts down Shaw while he attempts to secure some 'Mission: Impossible' level widget that he can sell to even worse people than himself. Big, ridiculous action chases ensue that end in very predictably with Dom's plucky band of renegade underdogs seizing the day and out maneuvering the villain du jour. While we gain a crew member back with Letty's return we also lose some by the end of the film. In dispatching Shaw our heroes wind up creating a new enemy that is hinted at in a mid credits scene.

This series started off as a simple street racing movie where a cop was trying to take down some bad guys. With the fifth installment this series really leveled up and decided what kind of films these were going to be going forward, and that was using Dom's multi-ethnic crew as a some version of a SEAL team, but with better wheels. 'Furious 6' continues with this trend as government agent Hobbs reaches out to have this wild bunch, outlaw team aid him and the government in taking down a serious threat although that is just a side benefit as the team really just wants Letty back to make their family whole again. The notion of family in this franchise verges on a punchline, but also it is part of the secret sauce that makes these films work. They even set up the villain as sort of the anti Dom who treats his crew like replaceable machine parts and thus one of the larger themes is speaks to how the familial loyalty makes Dom and his crew superior to Shaw and his minions no matter how many fancy gadgets and weapons of mass destruction they may possess. The action set pieces here get larger and the cars are just as stunning. There are incredibly ridiculous moments that bust right through your suspension of disbelief, but this is quickly becoming one of those franchises where you don't really care. You just buckle your seat belt, rev your engine and enjoy the ride.",hoernkeem,2023-09-25,2023,Negative,0.133,0.748,0.12,-0.944

The whole story is very boring, it doesn't hold up and tries to be extraordinary, but it fails to entertain either through the narrative or the action.

27,27,6.0,"Continuing on the action, leaving street racing behind.","""Fast & Furious 6"" continues to steer the franchise away from its street-racing roots, delving deeper into high-stakes criminal heists and action-packed sequences. The film, directed by Justin Lin, effectively leverages the established chemistry of its returning ensemble cast, though it distinctly pivots towards more generic action movie territory compared to the underground racing culture that initially fueled the series.

The plot centers on Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew, who are coerced out of their newfound tranquility by federal agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) to take down a skilled mercenary outfit led by the ruthless Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). Shaw's plans are formidable and call for high-octane interventions, which justify the movie's series of explosive set pieces. The film benefits from these adrenaline-pumping moments, including a particularly memorable tank chase on a public highway and a cargo plane's explosive runway finale.

However, the shift in focus from underground racing to an action-heavy narrative about global criminal enterprises might not sit well with purists of the franchise. The visceral thrill of street racing, which was the franchise's original allure, is largely replaced by a spectacle that could belong to any action franchise. Despite this, the film's execution remains robust, with well-choreographed fight scenes and car chases that manage to captivate, if not entirely surprise.

The emotional stakes are raised with the return of Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez), previously thought dead, adding a personal vendetta to Toretto's mission. This personal angle adds a layer of complexity to the storyline, providing a welcome depth to the otherwise straightforward plot. The theme of family, a staple of the series, continues to be the backbone of the narrative, providing continuity and emotional resonance amidst the chaos.

While ""Fast & Furious 6"" may not reinvent the wheel, it still delivers solid entertainment for fans of high-energy action films. It might not reach the heights of cinematic masterpiece, but with its decent execution and dedication to evolving its characters and storyline, it provides enough to keep viewers engaged. Overall, the film deserves a modest 6 out of 10, reflecting its capability to entertain and thrill, despite veering away from the original elements that made the franchise standout.",schmittfalte,2024-05-04,2024,Positive,0.055,0.858,0.087,0.884

29,29,9.0,incredible action scenes,"""Furious 6"" is in my opinion a film too much hated and underestimated of this saga. In this film the action scenes are spectacular, absolutely not at the level of the fifth film, but of excellent quality. In this film you can see the sharp change of the franchise, going from the crime of the characters to being heroes: I think it succeeded very well. They made the right choice not to make the actual heroes after a personal choice but with a choice linked to the well-being of the family. It is also clear that in recent films the protagonist is no longer Brian but is Toretto, making the saga much worse, which in my opinion is just right to give some news but.... I love Brian too much. The plot of the film entertained me and interested me, but not as much as the other films, it seemed a little too long, in my opinion it could be shortened a little bit. This film reports Letty, that after the now decreed ""fake death"" in the fourth chapter of the franchise returns giving a chance to Dominic. I understood this choice very well: Dom would never have returned to his previous life without a shocking family news. I hope, however, that they do not remake it with other characters because otherwise it would become too much science fiction, too many dead-resurrected. I liked the new characters and their in-depth introductions, and Shaw seemed like a pretty motivated antagonist. The actors confirm themselves to be very good. The soundtracks are incredible and I think it also improves photography here. I really enjoyed the final scene of the airport, beautifully organized with perfect soundtracks. The setting of the film is excellently chosen as well as the costumes and cars used are gorgeous. I think that this sixth film of the franchise is too undervalued, in my opinion definitely at the level of previous..

32,32,6.0,"""Ride or die, remember?""","FILM : 6.0
Rewatching the 2013 film Fast and Furious 6, I find myself with mixed feelings. Ugh. Just when things were heading in the right direction. Justin Lin sure knows how to make entertaining films, but the constant escalation of action pushes things so far past the point of realism that you think you're watching a Marvel film.Here we have Dom, Brian, and Co. Doing crazy stuff with tanks and planes which defies all reality. In the first film, it was a struggle for both of them to get Vince off a truck. Now, they're involved in stunts that seem to laugh in the face of physics. Don't get me wrong, it's fun and entertaining, but I just wish I didn't need to completely check my brain at the door in order to enjoy it.The film continues to deliver on the promise of high-octane action and thrilling set pieces. The cast's chemistry remains strong, and it's always a pleasure to see them working together. However, the sheer absurdity of some scenes, like the infamous runway sequence, stretches believability to its limits. Oh, and don't get me started on the length of that runway!Despite these over-the-top moments, there are still elements to enjoy. The humour and banter between characters add a light-hearted touch, making the more outrageous stunts easier to swallow. The story itself is engaging enough, even if it relies heavily on the ""family"" theme that's become the franchise's hallmark.While the film is undeniably entertaining, I can't help but feel that it loses some of the grounded charm that made the earlier entries appealing. The balance between action and realism tips too far in favour of spectacle, leaving little room for the more intimate, character-driven moments that I appreciate.Overall, it's a relatively fun ride that offers plenty of excitement, but it sacrifices too much in the pursuit of bigger and crazier stunts. For fans of the franchise, it's worth a watch, but it doesn't quite hit the mark as well as some of the other entries.FORMAT: Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.5

33,33,7.0,"More of the same after Fast Five, but still satisfying.","I watched this back to back with Furious 7, which does a disservice to Fast & Furious 6, because there is much more to talk about regarding its follow-up. That's the gut-punch Fast and Furious movie. That's the one where we have to say goodbye to Paul Walker. I'm reviewing what's a solid/fun action movie and I don't know what I can say about it substantially, because the seventh movie lingers most in my memory. But I'll do my best.The sixth Fast & Furious movie feels a lot like the fifth, perhaps too much so. Now, the fifth Fast & Furious movie was awesome, so I understand wanting to hit the same beats. It hits those beats and gets a little sillier with them, which I found fun to an extent, but there is a sense of things coming close to shark-jumping, at a point. It's a consequence of the repetition narratively speaking alongside what the filmmakers felt was a need to top Fast Five, as far as ridiculousness was concerned. I don't know if they needed to do that. Replicating the heights reached in Fast Five might've been enough, because the perfect level of stupid was achieved in that one. It's a high I'm okay with the series not reaching, from this point forward (some of those criticisms can also be applied to movie #7, but the inclusion of Kurt Russell, Jason Statham, and that powerhouse ending helped... but I'm getting ahead of myself).On its own, Fast & Furious 6 is still good. It's still entertaining. It's still my third favorite so far, after only #5 and #7. A little fatigue was setting in at this point, but #7 hit hard... and, honestly, the ending of Fast & Furious 6 was emotional enough in some ways, too. I am invested, though not entirely confident with where things will go from #7. But #6 and #7 back-to-back were fun. The former's overshadowed by the latter, but the pairing still made for a ridiculous and entertaining double feature.",Jeremy_Urquhart,2024-08-24,2024,Positive,0.121,0.751,0.128,0.6243
34,34,5.0,Like every other boring action movie of this decade,"Fast and Furious 6 = 5/10

This part of the series now completely abandons any logic or the original street races, which unfortunately leaves a very average action film.

As always, the film's stars The Rock, Paul Walker and Vin Diesel don't act particularly well and simply downplay the stupid script.

But what makes this film special is that the action has never been so gigantic in this franchise, be it a fight on a plane, a tank that destroys everything and sports cars everywhere in between. A certain amount of fun that you can't deny this film.

Nevertheless, the film lacks a certain charm, it has no special camera angles, no new ideas and just seems like any other action film from the last decade.

He also takes away the height of the fall and the significance of the plot since Letty survived anyway. Her new connection to the very uncharesmatic antagonists doesn't make the plot any better either.

The series had lost its identity completely by this point, becoming a generic action movie with a nod to the cars here and there. If you're looking for unique movies with a real look at car culture the first three movies are iconic and very good films too. The 4th was where they transitioned into more generic action but was still a solid film, but this was absolute trash. I feel like I'm being generous with 4/10. I was openly laughing with my friends in the cinema at the ridiculous aeroplane scene, featuring the 18.37 mile long runway (BBC estimate) and some of the most ridiculous unbelievable almost superhere-esque fighting scenes. I think that scene is an accurate representation of the whole movie.

With an all-star cast across the board we get the usual great performance from both Paul Walker (Brian O'Conner) and Vin Diesel (Dom Toretto). Unfortunately other than that none of the other big name actors are put in big enough roles to do anything huge. Luke Evans as Owen Shaw is a fine character. We don't know anything about him besides the fact that he is supposed to be a bad character. We don't understand motives or backstory or really anything about him. It personally feels like a wasted character for a big name actor. You as the audience don't feel like the stakes are too high until the final 20 minutes of the film. At that point. There isn't very much character development if any. Both Letty's transformation and Riley's reveal as the spy are predictable and not very satisfying. However we do get a nice ending. The cinematography and car chase action are better than ever in this film as well.

41,41,5.0,Hey I liked the last one but can we settle down a bit now guys?,"Nonsensical action is straight ahead, and we're smashing the NOS button. Fast 6 begins the descent into insanity, and I'm kind of here for it. I don't know how self-aware the cast and crew are, but at least when it comes to execution they're bringing their A game. The emphasis on practical effects is still here, and the characters maintain their charisma. The plot is absolutely ridiculous of course but who watches the vroom vroom bang bang car movies for that? This is a shounen anime now and an absolute magnet for teenage boys.I didn't ever intend to return to the franchise after watching 7 when it released, but a friend wanted to watch through them to see how they got to whatever nonsense was shown in the Fast X trailer. I didn't really care for the car-centric films earlier on, and don't usually watch over-the-top action films. So I liked the balance act that Fast Five pulled, and now I'm still watching because of a morbid curiousity. This entry has a final sequence with a foundation that's rightly ridiculed to this day. And within that sequence there's even sillier moments that we burst out laughing at. I suppose I was entertained short-term, but I'm afraid of the damage to my later years. It also tries to tell the viewer that Tokyo Drift takes place after this chronologically. They were using flip phones in Tokyo Drift. I don't think so.So, dumb movie, probably worth watching. I think the writer is genuinely trying, which helps a lot. I can't believe there's 5 more of these.",H4wke,2024-11-06,2024,Positive,0.07,0.832,0.099,0.8231
42,273,7.0,A Thrilling Ride of Absurdity and Entertainment,"Fast and Furious 6 is a rollercoaster ride of action, absurdity, and entertainment. Despite its numerous unrealistic and ridiculous scenes, the film manages to hold itself together with a strong and engaging story. Overall, I would give it a solid 7/10.The story revolving around Letty's regaining of her memory is captivating and emotionally resonant. The relationship between Brian and Mia continues to evolve in a manner that is both realistic and endearing. Additionally, the introduction of Deckard Shaw at the end of the film sets the stage for an exciting sequel.Moreover, the film sees the return of one of my favorite Non-Toretto Crew characters, Luke Hobbs, played by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. His presence adds an extra layer of badassery to the already impressive cast. Furthermore, Owen Shaw's conniving and charismatic personality is a delight to watch, making him a compelling villain.However, there were some elements of the film that I found to be less impressive. The movie's handling of Giselle's death is disappointing, with the story quickly moving on from it without giving the audience time to process or feel the loss. Furthermore, the tank battle on the highway and the final battle on the military airfield are so unrealistic that they become absurd and entertaining in a way that takes away from the film's overall serious tone. These scenes are so stupid that it's fun to laugh at how unrealistic the nature of them all are Lmao.For instance, the idea that a single car, no matter how advanced, could feasibly pull down an entire military cargo plane, even if it's carrying maximum weight, is laughable. Similarly, the notion that a tank, which is designed for heavy artillery and armored combat, could be taken down by a single car is far-fetched, even by Fast and Furious standards.In conclusion, Fast and Furious 6 is an enjoyable movie that is worth watching, even if it does require the viewer to suspend their disbelief. Its entertaining and engaging story, along with its exciting action scenes, make it a worthy addition to the franchise. However, its unrealistic and ridiculous elements, particularly the tank battle and final battle, may be off-putting to some viewers.",douglasc11,2025-01-06,2025,Positive,0.12,0.74,0.139,0.8002

44,200,6.0,The Soap Opera Continues,"I don't even say it like it is a bad thing, but this series has definitely become a soap opera. I said it in my last review when the plot seemed to be extended too far, but now we have complete memory loss factoring it which absolutely sounds like a plot from the soap operas my gram would watch when I was young. This was a pretty easy movie to rate. If you are looking for action, it delivers. If you are looking for plot or humor, it doesn't. There are enough scenes to like for me to rate it about the same as others in the franchise, but that is considering the audience and not its absolute cinematic quality. You get what you expect with these movies, but their target audience seems pretty small once we get to the 6th one in the franchise.",jaredlemin,2025-02-01,2025,Positive,0.031,0.806,0.163,0.9723

47,246,7.0,Fast & Furious 6: Nitro in the Veins and Punches to the Jaw,"Ah, the return of the brothers of motor oil. When Dom Toretto says ""Family,"" you better brace yourself, because at any moment, he might drop a presidential-level speech between two high-octane chases. Here, Justin Lin isn't holding back. We've got a team of mercenaries straight out of a Call of Duty mission, chases that could make Mad Max blush, and fight scenes that hit harder than a shonen anime mid-power-up.Critics said they'd drifted too far from street racing? Buckle up and shut up, because this movie is fueled by nostalgia and diesel injected with Red Bull. The chases are choreographed like the final battle of Street Fighter, complete with mangled metal and explosions galore. Special shoutout to the tank scene-the moment you realize that gravity is just a suggestion Justin Lin chose to ignore.Between Vin Diesel delivering lines like an NPC in Skyrim and Dwayne Johnson slapping people so hard he could send Thanos into early retirement, the team is stacked. Add in the return of Letty, who we all thought was six feet under back in Episode 4 (like a video game boss who refuses to stay dead). Tyrese Gibson handles the one-liners, while Ludacris plays the tech genius hacking systems like he's Neo in The Matrix.If you're looking for deep dialogue, go watch Dead Poets Society. Here, conversations are just pit stops between stunts. The shootouts are as precise as an aimbot, the explosions are tuned to wake the dead, and the car chases... Think Mario Kart on cocaine with tanks and planes. Yeah, that's Fast & Furious 6.The real star of the movie? The concept of family. Dom could probably solve geopolitical conflicts with his speeches about how ""together, we're stronger."" It's borderline religious. You half-expect him to bless you with the holy trinity: Nitroglycerin, Fistfights, and Family. And somehow, it works. You'll find yourself getting misty-eyed during a reconciliation scene... until a truck explodes and reminds you why you're really here.Fast & Furious 6 is like a greasy kebab after a night of heavy drinking. It wrecks your stomach, but damn, it feels good. If you're craving deep reflection, go watch an indie film about Norwegian existentialism. But if you want flying cars, sweaty muscles, and explosions worthy of a Dragon Ball Z finale, then step on the gas. Dom Toretto is waiting, with a tank full of nitro.",OniFR,2025-02-08,2025,Positive,0.066,0.856,0.077,0.1519
48,115,7.0,Not Really Fast or Furious,"Still trying to get through all the films in this franchise (I still have two yet to see since I've watched them out of order and started with parts 8&9 first) and they still do absolutely nothing for me. ""The Family"" has gotten increasing big (but at least they get rid of a few characters for this film) and the themes haven't changed (which makes it all a bit dull and predictable) and the best thing about this film is Tyrese and Ludicrous (whom seem to get all the best lines). As much as I love Luke Evens, he's wasted in this film as is The Rock (who is in true supporting character mode). I wasn't impressed with any of the action sequences (except for maybe the tank sequence as that was the most entertaining sequence in the entire film). I can't even say that through all the blandness that the cast was pumped and energize as most of them seemed to be phoning it in. I haven't seen Furious 7 yet...I'm not excited in the least and surprised this franchise has lasted as long as it has.",nqmedia,2025-02-09,2025,Positive,0.074,0.754,0.172,0.9793
