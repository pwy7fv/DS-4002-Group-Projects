1.0,How many times can Paul Walker say 'Bro'?,"I liked Fast and the Furious... it had Diesel Power AND the hot n tempting Michelle Rodriguez... I don't think Paul Walker is that bad either......UNTIL, I saw _2 FAST! 2 FURIOUS!_  Jeez, now talk about crap. But then again, I care about street racing zero and the supporting cast even less.  Paul Walker couldn't save anything with his pretty pretty face no matter how many times he called Gangstas, cops, Ludacris, fellow racers, hot asian chicks, or his best friend from good ol' Barstow ""Bro"".   Even him saying ""Cus"" couldn't make him look down.  Sure, there's eye candy for about two hours....but then again the first one had that AND Diesel Power along with Michelle Rodriguez goodness....so, I'd say AVOID, unless you dig street racing(which ain't a bad thing) or like watching Paul Walker really really act like a poorman's Keanu Reeves.....with less talent",Steal-No-Evol,2003-06-06,2003
1.0,ABSOLUTELY AWFUL,"Don't waste your time, energy, & money on seeing this movie. It's absolutely the most horrible movie I've ever seen. If I had paid to see this movie I would be thoroughly upset! I cant even think of 4 lines worth of comments to say about this movie it's just so horrible please do not go watch it! I'm really disappointed that it moved Matrix Reloaded out of our stadium seating theatre.. This is such a horrible movie!!",marchinglion2003,2003-06-06,2003
1.0,Promoting false Macho Images Through Models driving cars,Fast Cars equals Strength and Popularity?Is American pop culture helping to promote stupidity though dangerous activities instead of intelligence?Lets just hope this film helps American Teens kill each other trying more Street Racing just like in the movie. Maybe Then less will forget to vote.,daltonmania,2003-06-06,2003
2.0,Almost as bad as Driven. And that's REALLY bad.,"Firstly let me say that I'm a huge fan of motorsport - F1, CHAMP cars, touring cars - and raced for several years myself, so I'm very critical of any inconsistencies(?) in motorsport in movies.   But this movie was absolutely insulting.  I almost walked out during the first half hour, something I've never done before. I know that with some movies nowadays, it's just mindless entertainment, and you're supposed to suspend disbelief and just enjoy it.  But this movie actually made me embarrassed to be a human being.  I'm not exaggerating. I'm yet to understand why, during a race, they're changing gears every 5 seconds and why, when someone draws near them, they suddenly plant their foot and take off.  Why wasn't their foot already planted? And we got a shot of the speedo rapidly accelerating from 110 to 160km/h when they've been going flat out in a straight line for 20 seconds This movie is full of the usual Hollywood cliches and every second word is ""bro"". The characters are so cheesey and not worth caring about that I wasn't even bothering to pay attention to the storyline. Okay, now for the few good points that stopped this movie from getting a 0 out of 10.  Eva Mendes is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen and I want her bad.  The character of Roman Pearce slowly becomes funny and is the only reason to listen to any dialogue, but the cinema actually gasped in disbelief at one stage when he took his shirt off for virtually no reason at all, just to display his body. Um, I thought I had more good points, but I've just realised that's it.  The sound is pretty awesome, and I suppose the camerawork during the race scenes is good, but it's probably over 50% computer generated.  But apart from that, don't waste your money on this film.",hillsracing30,2003-06-06,2003
7.0,Fun Movie,"We went opening night - my husband (architect) and I (professor) took boys aged 15, 14 and 13 and a pair of 11 year old girls.  We ALL enjoyed 2 Fast 2 Furious - in fact my husband and I agree it was better than the first (we expected otherwise).  No gratuitous sex so it's okay for kids.  Plenty of humor, lots of COLOR, clever photography, a Miami Vice-style plot, exciting driving and stunts, and a lot of fun.",JBFLeBlanc,2003-06-06,2003
7.0,fun and entertaining for action fans,"I work at a movie theatre; and as such I get the benefits of seeing some movies earlier than others :) I am a fan of the first film (I bought it) so I figured I would see this one too since the staff were running it tonight. I pretty much thought this movie would bite huge, it wasnt bad at all, quite entertaining. Tyrese was pretty funny too, and Ludacris did a pretty decent job with his part, of course this movie isnt realistic...I still wonder about some of the things that happened - but leave your brain at the door and you'll have a blast. Im glad there were no sex scenes, as both of the main female actors I personally find kind of nasty. As a previous reviewer stated; its a fun summer movie. They're right.",rageprblm,2003-06-06,2003
10.0,Expected nothing but loved every minute.,"I'm a 53 year old woman and I didn't even want to go to this movie.  I thought the previews looked boring and figured it would be a waste without Van Diesel. There wasn't anything else opening so out of boredom I went.
What a great surprise to be mesmerized throughout the entire thing.  I caught myself clapping my hands and yelling in surprise at the great stunts, which I can't remember ever happening before. Paul Walker as Brian was great but Tyrese Gibson, as Roman, was incredible.  He made the whole show. My husband and friend really liked it also.
It was refreshing to have a show with a good plot, no boring parts but not continual brain numbing action either, unique and believable actors without 1000 F words like usual.  In fact it didn't have any and I would feel comfortable with a teenager seeing it. In other words, I thought this movie had a lot of class.",porterrockwell,2003-06-06,2003
2.0,fast lane for the big screen :(,"Tyrese can act, no doubt of that. The actress in the role of the undercover agent... what was her name, could it have been Latina Amber Theissan?The first Fast and Furious captured the vibe of LA's car culture. This film was nothing but gratuitous.  The only thing that was amused me was how the ambient techno soundtrack during the car chase scenes so vividly reminded me of the soundtrack of the Ridge Racer 4 Video Game.Lots of good hootchie babes in gratuitous scanty clothes, and the worst and most sad is that a film like this is going to do much to encourage the dangerous fad of street racing that causes so much heartache when the poor kids caught up in that pursuit can't really drive as well as Movie Stunt Drivers.Speaking of the car chases... it's all gritty closeups and trick shots. Never once do you get a feeling that there was some actual car racing going on. What would have been cool would have been a long shot here and there.
Our vote for the best supporting character was actress playing Suki. She can't act (maybe she'll improve with time) but she's got the most authentic street vibe in the pic.If there is one film you see this summer - let it be The Matrix Reloaded.",shadowycat,2003-06-06,2003
10.0,Better than the original,"2 Fast 2 Furious is a fun movie. It is better than the original. Lots of fun. A great summer action movie with a great cast. The storyline is good and the cast, especially Paul Walker and Tyrese do a awesome job. Also a good supporting cast. Lots of humor and action. A great summer movie.",Kellyann-1,2003-06-06,2003
5.0,Just Okay,"I didn't think that it was as good as the first one, not even close.  The cars were nice and the music was good, but it just didn't give me the rush the first one did.  The whole thing was pretty predictable from start to finish. 2 Stars out of 4",Cindy2u79,2003-06-06,2003
5.0,Like a new-age Roger Corman B-picture fused with a Grand Theft Auto game (minus the enthralling theft portion)...,"Which means that for fans of those types of movies and games, this should provide satisfactory pleasure for a couple of hours.  Personally, I liked the first one, only cause it had a certain popcorn movie appeal that worked, and from Diesel showing off his skills as a lead in a Hollywood movie.  And this is not to say I don't have a respect for filmmakers trying to capture the spirit and cinematic aloofness as a Corman film would, and GTA III and Vice City are great games.  But the problem lies in that when the action sequences finally come to play, the thrills just aren't there, at least for me.  Despite director John Singleton's need to have two or less-than-two second cuts of feet hitting on pedals, cars changing lanes, characters saying one liners like ""How do you like them apples!"", it comes off as, well, kind of boring.  And Singleton, who is usually better at doing urban drama pictures (and the occasional good remake like Shaft), is un-needed here.  He brings a style, that's certain, as well as a hot-shot Tyrese Gibson (off of 2001's Baby Boy), however it seemed to be lacking something that should have been there, even in the super-charged climax down the highways and streets of Miami.  I suppose for those who put the original on their top ten lists two years back this will be entertaining, and I'll admit I was grinning at a few jokes (and with Ludicrous' all-too-minor role).  Yet, I know this is just one more to add to the lists of upcoming disapointments for this summer's film list. Grade: C",Quinoa1984,2003-06-06,2003
8.0,2 FAST IS FURIOUS!,"Man, I must say...I went into to see this opening day just for the cars, and thinking it was going to bomb. But compared to the first. this movie is great! Cars, Chicks, Action & A WAY better story line then the first one. Paul Walker has improved his acting skills big time and the bad guy in the movie was just great as well. I do not want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet, so I will just end by saying that if you loved the first one, your really going to go ape nuts over this one for sure. Money well spent in my opinion! :)",muffyio,2003-06-06,2003
6.071428571428571,FOR THOSE 2 HOURS OR LESS... I WAS ENTERTAINED!,"I liked this movie. Don't get me wrong, The Fast and the Furious was better in my book but this movie was good enough to pay to see. The thing that disappointed me though was the fact that it didn't have a few more people from the first movie. It was cool to see Paul Walker return and the same with his FBI detective dude, but couldn't they get at least a couple more to join for the ride? The cars are sweet but I thought it was funny to see a Cavalier and a Sunfire done-up as these are not true import racers. Once again they failed to include a 90+ Nissan 300zx, but oh well. I don't know why people always complain about the movie as having a bunk plot... they don't seem to understand that it's not easy to make a plot spectacular. That's not the goal of the producers. They just want to give the audience something entertaining. And they did so with both movies. Go check it out. The same people who hated the first one are standing in line right now to see the 2nd... but the difference now is that they are saying it sucked compared to the first! There are some really cool racing scenes and they are (besides the first one) quite a bit different than the first movie. Oh, one more thing... don't bother waiting until the end of the credits to see some cool thing about another sequel or something... there's nothing there. I guess they realized doing it at the end of FATF was a waste because Diesel didn't even sign for a 2nd film. Enjoy the film!!! Then go racing....",fastandthefurious,2003-06-06,2003
6.071428571428571,"Complete, Utter trash","All the previous stuff saying its better are studio plants, as I have never ever dry wretched during a movie. Well, scratch that, yes I did. And it wasn't a horror movie. Oh no, it was during 2 fast 2 furious. I created better dialogue when I was still learning how to write in Kindergarten, I could probably act better than Paul Walker back then too.

6.071428571428571,2 Embarrassing,"I saw this opening night and I really wanted to like it.  People at my job even made fun of me for wanting to see it, that is how much I was rooting for this film.  Obviously I know this is not Citizen Kane or the even far superior Point Break, but I had hopes of watching an enjoyable summer movie. I enjoyed the first one very much and was not expecting much substance in the sequel.  That being said it was very poor.  The opening race scene is very well done, but the rest of the movie is a mess.  Paul Walker is not bad, but it is hard to enjoy any of the other performances.  The villain (Cole Hauser) is one dimensional and his goons are stereotypical bad guys. One of the reasons the first one worked was because you actually liked Vin Diesel and his team.  It is hard to like anyone in the sequel.  The first one also had a certain style, with nice transitions between scenes (day to night time lapses, nos effects, etc.).  If you don't have your lead actor (Vin Diesel), then at least spotlight the cars, the actual races and enhance the effects.  There are actually only 3-4 real driving scenes.  All they really did was show close-ups of gears shifting fifty times and blur the screen when the nos button was pressed.  The ending is absolutely ridiculous.  4 out of 10 (The opening scene is awesome, thats it).",jutah9,2003-06-07,2003
1.0,2Boring2Crappy,"I saw this movie the other day with more expectations than it delivered. This movie was one of the worst I have seen all year. A lackluster plot and undeveloped characters. If I were to see Paul Walker on the street, I would tell him he owes me six dollars. Tyrese needs to stick to music. This movie was obviously rushed to the box office in a horrible attempt to gross a few million in sequel money. Worst sequel since Meatballs 2. And I mean that.",BobBazer,2003-06-07,2003
6.0,See it with an no expectation and you'll be supriesed.,"If you like the original and you're looking for a decent way to spend a Friday night, see 2 Fast 2 Furious. I have to admit, when the movie began, I thought it was going to blow. I mean, the reviews are bad, and no Vin Deisel!! I really wasn't expecting much. When the movie ended and I looked back on the what I had just watched, I was suprised. No, this movie didn't suck like critics will say. I have to say, I enjoyed this movie more than I did X-Men 2 or The Matrix Reloaded, not because it was the better movie, because my expectations for it were low. Honestly, I thought X-2 and Reloaded were going to be the greatest movies ever made, and when they didn't live up to my expectations, they were both good, I was dissapointed. When 2 Fast ended up being a fun enjoyable movie, instead of the laughably bad movie I thought it was going to be, I realised that the last hour and a half was time enjoyable spent.

10.0,more fast more furious,"No matter what, there is no way the first one will ever top this one. The action sequences are far better choreographed and numbered, the bad guys are more dangerous, the plot is better, but has too similar a  sequence of events to the first one, the acting is slightly better, and the cars are faster. There are not as many bad things about this movie as TFATF, but it is still a great movie. It smokes the first one by about 10 miles. I can't wait for the DVD. 7/10.

9.0,NICE!,"Great fun movie.  Definitely worth the 9 bucks.  More of a standard ""buddy"" movie than the first one with more humor and wordplay, but the action keeps coming.  Tyrese and Paul Walker do a good job of keeping things going without any ""Diesel power"" hehehe.",briginsh,2003-06-07,2003
9.0,its a pretty good film,"I enjoyed the first film and i personally thought this would not be all that good, but i saw it anyway. Although i did notice some errors through out the film such as

when the car jumps on top of the boat it seems like when they crash they seemed farther away from the land then was shown when they actually jumped it but that could be just me

the comedy is above average and I would recommend seeing it

6.071428571428571,more of the same in something entirely different,"Whats common in many reviews of this sequal is that it has very little to do with actual street racing.  Ironically, that is about the only simularity it has with its predecessor (along with having the same film lead Paul Walker). The first film was more about Dom Torreto and his crew hi-jacking semi-trucks, he just haapened to be a well respected and skilled street racer.  Conversely, the 2 Fast 2 Furious, is more about trying to catch a money laundering druglord and the two people that will help police just happened to be well respected and skilled street racers.  As mentioned before though, this is where the simularities stop.  The first film was trying (key word being ""try"") to show an authentic portrayal of a street racers life.  The story was simple and focused and attempted to be deep (like with the whole ""team"" being more like a family that neither of the characters have had but always wanted) but at the same time, also be fun and entertaining.  2 Fast 2 Furious, on the other hand, did all it could to be fun and entertaining, and thwarted any attempt at a simple, focused, and deep  story.  This becomes quite clear after the first race when the finish is jumping off a bridge that is half up and the victor wins by literally jumping over the car ahead of it in mid-air (this would have an impressive stunt but since it is quite obvious that the cars were digitally composed in mid-air, it kinda takes the thrill out of it).  Beleive it or not, that is not the craziest thing to happen in the movie.  Anyway, onto the story . . . there is not really much to talk about with the story.  The best way to put it is it begins as a race movie, turns into a buddy/cop movie, turns into Miami Vice, has a little of Canonball Run, goes back to being a race movie, then returns to Buddy/cop movie, goes back to Miami Vice, then turns into Dukes of Hazard briefly, then ends like a buddy/cop movie.  Clearly, any attempt at a well thought out story, or even a cohesive one, took a back seat to create the maximum fun factor (in fact common sense is thrown out the window becuase in the middle of a race, Paul Walker's character does a 180, drives in reverse, then does another 180 to face forward just before going onto a off-ramp).on a personal note, I found it rather disturbing that the mustang, corvette, Baracuda, and Camaro all got destroyed while the evolution and Eclispe escaped unscathed.  ALso, they had the 2003 Viper in it for only about a total of 20 seconds racing against the evolution and eclispe and amazingly, the viper stayed behind (an example of the direcotr, writer, producer, whatever completely ignoring cold hard facts: none of the cars racing against the new Viper could have kept up with it period).",illeatyourdog,2003-06-07,2003
10.0,Awesome! go see it!,I saw this movie last night and i gotta say it is better than the first and it's probly one of the best movies ever made! if u got the time go see it in the theatre DO IT! dont wait 'til it's too late and u have to wait for it to come out on video! trust me if u like those kinds of movies its worth the $8.25 er whatever it is in ur area!,nellys_lil_luna_chick,2003-06-08,2003
4.0,Once again proving that John Singleton is a 1-hit wonder...,"If it weren't for Boyz N Tha Hood, Singleton would be unheard of. I'm pretty certain the name has gone to his head. I'd read a week ago where he seems to be of the opinion that he was going to literally change the face of streetcars with everyone wanting to follow the styles in this movie. While I can't speak for anyone else, I can for myself and that is; if I won any of the cars in a contest, I'd have them stripped of their paint and resprayed right away. They were godawful. Now, onto the movie itself. The story was silly, the acting about as good as the first (take that how you want to), the dialogue horrible, and the cinematography was not as exciting, fulfilling or flawless as the first. **SPOILER** The best black mark against the shooting of it was the scene where they race into a compound and the Lancer breaks through the steel barrier. It's bad enough to imagine this happening and the result being no front end damage, but when the scene isn't cut quick enough and you actually SEE the vehicle get damaged, only to see the damage wiped away next shot is unforgivable. Ludicrous as an actor? Please. Having a rap star act is as bad as having an actor rap. Tell me he wasn't hired due to supposed 'star power' only. Don't go to this movie, even if you are a fan of cars (which I am).",nivek_nailgun,2003-06-08,2003
10.0,A lot better than the first.,"I say it's a lot better than the first because of a number of reasons. The first, and main overall, was because Vin Diesel WASN'T in it. That totally fixed up the whole movie. The first movie seemed like it was centered on him with his bad ass/whiny attitude and hot temper. Plus, there really wasn't no plot to hold anything together. Cop meets street racer, cop makes friends with street racer, all of a sudden there's a Chinese bad guy.This movie improved big time, and I'm not only saying that because of the cars and the girls. There was a plot, the movie didn't get boring after a certain period of time either. It felt like watching Grand Theft Auto: Vice City missions, which is another reason why I thought the movie was better. Also, Tyrese's collaboration of bas ass and comedian really made it good. I'll definately buy this DVD.",The_King,2003-06-08,2003
10.0,better than 1,"This movie is how you make a sequel. Cooler cars, better story, and better director. The story was so much better that the first one.

8.0,"Simple minded, summer escapist fair.","Having no expectations at all for `2 Fast 2 Furious,' seeing it was a surprising venture-it was actually good. It wasn't as serious as its predecessor, `The Fast and The Furious.' However, it was a likable summer escapist film that was more fun than the original.  It gives its audience a two-hour adrenaline rush and it is this summer's most exciting motion picture, thus far. 	`2 Fast 2 Furious' picks up two years after the previous film, where Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) has quit the force and is living in Miami, street racing by night. When his former boss, Agent Bilkins (Thom Barry) shows up with a job, he can't refuse it because would wipe clean his former criminal record that he created while in Los Angeles. Brain's job is to drive a carload of money for a crooked importer/exporter named Carter Verone (Cole Hauser), who has made millions off of drug trafficking. But Brian can't do it alone-he needs the help of an old friend named Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson), who has spent several years in prison for boosting cars and is now on parole. The pair tares up the black top wherever they go as they help the U.S. Customs track down Carter before he gets away. 	Director John Singleton took the reins from director Rob Cohen to make this sequel. It's somewhat unfamiliar territory for Singleton whose primarily only dealt with more serious issues in cinema-perhaps he wanted to have more fun and take a break from films like `Baby Boy,' and `Rosewood.' But he does a great job at filming crash scenes, however absurd as they may be.	Walker reprises his role as Brian, the once cop, now full-time street racer. Walker is slick as the main character, but somewhat ridiculous too as he dresses like a thirteen-year-old and has just as much ambition in his life. Gibson joins `The Fast and the Furious' series as Roman, a tough guy with an attitude. His character is far more likable than the Vin Diesel's character because he brings to the screen a better blend of humor with his hard-ass nature. It's hard to miss the gorgeous Eva Mendez as Monica Clemente, an inside agent in Carter's life. And rap singer Ludacris joins the cast as Tej, a former street racer who now only sets the deals for the racers as a booker. 	Unlike `The Fast and The Furious,' this sequel is actually more enjoyable than the first. The original came off as overly macho at times, mostly because of Diesel's character, which made it annoying to watch. `2 Fast 2 Furious' is just pure fun from beginning to end-it doesn't come off as too serious and it doesn't go over the top with simple one-liner's and campy action sequences like `XXX.' This film's action sequences look real, but there is no way in hell they could ever happen. The car chases, however spectacular, are as highly preposterous-a racer crashes while driving at a high speed and doesn't get a scratch. Also, one car gets caught between two tractor-trailers and ends up getting caught under one of the trailer's tires and is crushed. But no one seems to care that the driver must have been killed. Guess we're not supposed tohe was a bad guy, anyway.	Although amazingly silly, `2 Fast 2 Furious' is still a good bet if you are looking for simple minded, summer escapist fair. ***",ilovedolby,2003-06-08,2003
8.0,Great shallow fun (8/10),"Call me stupid, call me a teenage boy (which I am), tell me that I have bad taste in movies (this is questionable, and its up to you, really), and tell me that I am part of the ADD generation ('tis true I tell you), but goddamnit I loved this movie. Sure, there is no substance, and sure it is shallow beyond belief, but I just loved it. Let me tell you why.I love cars. This is not a secret. And even though these aren't Mercedes, or BMWs, they really are amazing machines. The amount of money that these characters (well filmmakers, really) put into these cars is astounding. There should be no question at all as to where the 100 million dollars that they spent on this movie went. The cars are beautiful machines. And to me, watching these cars race at such high speeds, may be the equivalent of listening to classical music, or reading a good book to someone else. I do enjoy both of these things though. The action scenes here are better than the first time around. From the opening street race, to the grand finale, the action is bigger, better, and more stylized. John Singleton is definately a better director than Rob Cohen. He infuses style throughout this flick, and just makes it a fun time. Another thing to note about this film is that it doesn't take itself nearly as seriously as the first film. As for the characters, I loved them. Paul Walker is back, and he is great as Brian. He is easy going, laid back, and he is just having a fun time. Tyrese is a GREAT replacement for Vin Diesel. He has the same no-rules attitude, but he is substantially more likeable. He is extremely funny, and he provides a great action movie performance. Ludacris is also a nice new edition. He is also funny, and he shows that he is a much better actor than both Ja Rule and DMX combined. Both Eva Mendes and Devon Aoki aren't given much to do, but they are nice eye candy, and provide solid counterparts to our male leads. Cole Hauser also turns in a delicious performance as the typical bad guy. He is fun to watch. Everyone else is kind of just there, except for Thom Barry and James Remar who are good as the two head Customs and FBI agents respectively. What didn't I enjoy? The scene with the rat (see it and you will know what I mean) is a little out of place, but still decently enjoyable, and there are a few scenes (such as the card playing) that are thrown in there that could have been pulled out. But other than that, as far as I am concerned, it is a fun, fast, and action packed summer ride. I would also like to mention that I loved the music that played throughout, and I am not that big of a rap fan. In the end, criticize me if you want, or call me names but I am not budging. I loved this movie.2 Fast 2 Furious: 8/10 The First One Received The Same Grade As Well.",mhaddad-1,2003-06-08,2003
8.0,High Octane Action,"Spoiler Within.

Probably the best way to enter a movie like this, is to not expect the best acting in the world. And also not to expect the best plot in the world. The true objective is to provide intense action scenes that will create a movie appealing to people that are about 16-25 years old.

Based on this requirement, the movie succeeds at what it intends to do. It has plenty of high paced action and racing sequences, it has lots of beautiful women, and it has REALLY nice cars. For true fanatics, it might be worth it to see the movie for the cars.

Anyway, the acting, direction, and cinematography are just about where they are expected to be. Where this movie excells, is its wealth of incredible racing sequences. The best one is probably the one that opens the movie, but the other sequences are entertaining and worth watching as well.

As you go to see this movie, do not expect it to be something that its not. It will not be the next Godfather or anything, so don't expect it to be. If you go in with this attitude, you should exit the theater pleased with the experience. And if not, you probably were not in the target audience, so the movie was not aimed at you.

6.071428571428571,2 Muddled 2 Enjoy,"First of all, this film is not nearly as good as the original 'The Fast and the Furious', and the film's major flaws are the absence of original characters who were fun and interesting. Most notably, Vin Diesel. The thin plot centers around ex-cop Brian O'Conner (played by the very wooden Paul Walker) who is called back to infiltrate some sort of illegal operation. I'm not to sure what, because the plot was confusing. He gets to choose his partner and he selects a long lost buddy named Roman (played by the enjoyable Tyrese). This is where I'm guessing Vin Diesel would have returned. They are assisted by under cover agent Monica Clemente (played by the heavenly Eva Mendes). There is alot more racing in this one. But I'm not about the cars, I'm about the chicks. And the ladies don't get very much screen time. Which was another major flaw. Eva Mendes's character was undefined, first she's kissing Paul Walker and then suddenly the relationship is all platonic. I was like...wha? It's 100 minutes of racing and horrible acting from Paul Walker. Tyrese was fun to watch. I look forward to seeing him in other movies. As was Ludicris. John Singleton's directing was pretty good, but he didn't have much of a script to work with. As I stated before, the original is much better. Decent plot, hot chicks, all that good stuff. My advice to you is to avoid this movie like the plague.RATING: *1/2 out of ****",obiwan2005,2003-06-08,2003
6.071428571428571,This Is way better than the first,I saw this on Friday June the 6th and must say it was way better than the first because it had a lot more action and way better stunts. The acting was a little questionable at times but overall i give it 2 Thumbs Up.,NewGuy2002,2003-06-08,2003
6.071428571428571,"Tense, fun, and a pleasant surprise","I had cringed for months in advance.  I was expecting this movie to flop because it seemed like nothing more than a cheezy action flick.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised.The movie itself is fast-paced, and the cars beautiful (though I hated seeing the Skyline depart so soon).Brian O'Connor, having tried to leave his past behind, is offered a deal-take down the bad guy or go to jail.  The acting and characters are likeable and the bad guy is especially menacing.  From the moment you see how menacing he is, you are kept on the edge of your seat till the end.Overall, I'd rate it a 7 out of 10.What it loses in points are some scenes where the racing is a little impossible (like the bridge scene in GISS 2000), but it's still fun.  The styles of the cars and the characters clothing seem a bit cliched, but not cheezy.  Finally, some really nice cars-a beautiful Yenko Camaro and a Hemi Challenger, along with the Skyline-get wrecked.  But, you still have fun.",cluosborne,2003-06-08,2003

I think in order for someone to watch this movie you cannot take it seriously, you have to walk in to have a good time at the movies. Alot of people do not like the first one of this one but i think they look for the Oscar quality of the movie and you cant do that here. The story is about former cop Brian O'Conner who is now racing in Miami illegaly and when he gets busted Agent Bilkins(from the first) asks him to drive for a local import export dealer to bring him down. He recurits his old buddy Roman Pearce(tyrese).Together they drive for Carter Verone(Cole Hauser)and meet problems along the way.

10.0,more fast more furious,"This one was way better than the first, I don't care what all you other pladough brains say. It had better cars, women, plot, bad guys, and action. You should still watch the first one before you see this, even if it wasn't as good, if you want to get some of the stuff they talk about in this film. As far as the plot goes, it's a lot more interesting than a boring theft of electronic equipment. You're much more rather to watch a movie where the good guys are up against meaner and more dangerous bad guys who really have the thrill of danger in them. Actually only Verone did a good job showing that off, but the rest didn't do bad. Action sequences are what really smoke the original. Finally, a circuit race, and more amounts of races instead of cheesy talking for almost a whole act. I'm glad they improved on the races and action, otherwise I would have hated this movie. God Bless you, John Singleton.",SnakeEclipse1403,2003-06-09,2003
8.0,serious adrenaline pumping action.,"What can I say - I loved it.  It didn't have as much of a plot as the first but the writers definitely did a good job in linking the two movies together where Paul Walker's character is concerned.  Much more action with completely awesome racing scenes from start to finish.  Humor was more pronounced in this one compared to the first.  Bravo, all around.",ACMcC24,2003-06-09,2003
7.0,It outdid my expectations. The storyline was more developed.,"When I first heard that the sequel was coming out, I immediately wondered what cast members would return. I was surprised by Dom not returning but then again that was due to behind the scenes payment negotiations between the production company and Vin Diesel. Anyways, this story focuses on Brian O'Connor and does a good job of that. Where the original did not give alot of character development to O'Connor, this film took the time to explore his past and give him much more development. The storyline was also much more mature and had a higher level of intensity. In the first, we got introduced to the world of street-racing and how it works so now we have moved ahead, we know what it's like and how it's done so it doesn't need to be explained. The car chases were also much improved over the original, credit to the direction. Overall, this movie surpassed my expectations by more than a ""quarter mile"". Whether or not there will be another one, well, I don't know but if this is an indication of a continuing storyline franchise with Brian O'Connor, I think it could work.",JeffTylerSmith,2003-06-09,2003
4.0,The Moose Hole - 2 Fast 2 Furious Review,"When the original The Fast and the Furious opened in theaters back in 2001, it looked to be just another action flick to keep teenagers happy at the movies until the next big hit entered the multiplexes. But The Fast and the Furious became a much bigger then anybody expected, especially its distributor, Universal Pictures. The original film, which cost only $38 million for the studio, ended its run in theaters with over $110 million. The surprise hit of the summer became an even bigger surprise on DVD. The film became one of the largest selling DVDs in the year it was released. So with these results in hand, it was a no brainer for Universal to make a follow up. Unfortunately things didn't go the way Universal would have liked it. Rising-star Vin Diesel, who got his break out role in the original The Fast and the Furious, wanted a much bigger paycheck then Universal was willing to pay. So in the end, he ended up dropping out of the project. After Diesel dropped out, Rob Cohen, director of The Fast and the Furious, also dropped out of the sequel. But since Universal still had Paul Walker, the other star of the original, they decided to go on with the sequel without them. Will the risk pay off for Universal or will this high-octane thrill ride run out of gas?The story goes that street racing is a big thing in the city of Miami. Watching tricked out cars race up and down the street and seeing who crashes and who crosses the finish line is a huge thrill with the people of Southern Florida. One of the big stars of the street racing scene is Brian O'Conner, who last time we saw him was racing out in Los Angles with Vin Diesel as an undercover cop. But since he let the criminal go, he was forced to leave the police department. When he is caught by the police, he is recruited by them to track down a cruel Miami import/export dealer. When O'Conner doesn't like the partner the police team him up with, he recruits an old friend, Roman Pearce, to help him track down the dealer so they can get their records cleaned. The story for 2 Fast 2 Furious is one of the most ridiculous ones pulled out of a movie. It is certainly as worse or even more horrible then the one for the original film. Some elements are ridiculous crafted into the film and some of the chases scenes are set up in a way that are too predictable. The absence of director Rob Cohen is clearly obvious with the sequel. Though the original wasn't a movie masterpiece, Cohen had at least some consistency. This film lacks that very dearly.The characters of 2 Fast 2 Furious are, for the most part, just stereotypes. The rest that are not, don't do a great job acting through this tired script. Paul Walker, who didn't receive too many fabulous comments about his acting, or lack there of, in the original film, doesn't do much better in the follow up but one can see improvement. The only one in the cast that shows some sign of rising acting talent is Tyrese Gibson, who plays O'Conner's ex-con buddy, Roman Pearce. Tyrese brings a lot of well needed humor is this film that is, for the most part, fairly dry. Most of the rest of the cast aren't really worth mentioning. Devon Aoki who plays Suki in the film isn't given much outside of the look badass and hot at the same time argument. She has no important lines and really doesn't do much with her role in the first place. She is basically there just for show. Same goes for Eva Mendes, though her character obviously places a more important role. But on a technical note, her character really doesn't do too much. The rest of the cast, like it was said before, isn't worth mentioning.Overall, 2 Fast 2 Furious is not much of an improvement from the original but did we really expect it to be? Without the badass charm of Vin Diesel and the consistency of Rob Cohen at the helm, the project suffers greatly. The story is tired, dry and too predictable as the film progresses. For what was accomplished in the film, if anything at all, the film could have been wrapped up much quicker then the two hours it ran in. Nothing really stands out to take of big note within the film outside of the rising acting power of Tyrese Gibson. The film focuses too much on the scantily clad babes and the adrenaline powered cars to hear how ridiculous the script actually sounds. When they finish talking their `street lingo', the lines they pop out sound cheesy and dry. But one does have to admit that with all the problems the film suffers from, the racing scenes are very well done. The special effects, as impressive as they are, still look pretty fake, which is pretty obvious. The charm of the original, if that was possible for some, was the realistic racing scenes. Most of those in the sequel are done on computer with only the actors placed in motionless cars against a blue screen in order to add the CGI later on. This was possibly the biggest disappointment of the film with nothing else expected from the sequel. The month of June looks bad enough with four horrible duds opening up next weekend but with a start like 2 Fast 2 Furious, there is only one thing to say: Disney and Pixar should make a real killing with Finding Nemo this month.My Rating: ** out of 5 (Grade: D)",JAKastner,2003-06-09,2003
6.071428571428571,WoooOo!! [Drah] 2 Fast [Drah] 2 Furious,"Alright, i admit im a teenager. and that i am parcial to fast nice cars. Buh pleeze. Dont listen to the comments written by 40 year olds. okay?okay, first off, you ALL should know that Vin Diesel saw NOOO reason for his character to come back. But thats okay. ill get to that later.
This movie is AWESOME. Brian O' Conner gets thrown out of the FBI or whatever for giving his car keys to Vin in the last movie. So he has realized the art of street racing. which is a very nice thing. so hes racing and stuff, and then hes caught by the cops, in a rather funny way. So he finds out they want him to do another job and his record will be cleared, right? Okay, so he agrees, and they tell him he can pick ONE person to ride with. Heres where I MUST bring Vin Deisel in. see, he thinks theres no reason for his character to come back, yet here is the oppurtunity to bring him back, and for us to find out if Letty and them are okay. [[remember her car accident]] Buh most unfortunetly, they are no where in this movie, except in reference points. So we can get over having no Vin once we get into the movie.They did a VERY nice job with this movie. Buh there are some points i want to mention. I love the first movie [[all except for how they kill off Jessie. =/ Its just not right.....]] and I LOVE the second. buh i do have some parts i wasnt to fond of. Like the scene with the rat. I didnt think it fit to well, until i got to thinking, that Johnny Tran almost killed a man with oil. So im letting that go. But then Paul Walker....=/ he just didnt seem to click in this movie. I think hes a good actor and all, its just he was kind of whiny in a few parts. But i can overlook that. Im only mentioning it becuz it was unlike his character to do that. Kind of an out of place thing. I think this was all that i found disturbing. There may be more, but ill have to wait for the DVD to come out before i totally bash it. [[which is highly unlikely, considering next to tomb raider, this is my favorite movie.]] So i think ive covered everything.....Ill go on with my plot summary from above. After he picks his man [[someone he grew up with]] they're off to do good things =D Theres some drama along the way and then some more fast cars.....money....more cars.....and then it raps up in a nice big package. And i think they could actually pull off a third movie, if the plot is right, and if they convince Vin Deisel to make a comeback.So all in all this movie was GOOOOOOOOD!! Id go to the theatres and watch this over and over again. In fact....i think i will. =DI give it 10 Stars out of 5   =D",Paigeipo1004@yahoo.com,2003-06-09,2003

6.071428571428571,"Multi-ethnic cast goes vroom, vroom, vroooooommmm","*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*

""2 Fast 2 Furious"" is the embodiment of modern action movie formulas. PG-13. Rap music blasting. Multi-ethnic cast. This flick could play in any corner of the globe and would surely appeal to someone. They set it in Miami which is one of the most heavily mixed cities in America. You have a white guy as the star who is best friends with a black guy. Classic. Then they have them follow around a beautiful Latin woman as a potential love interest. Great. They even threw in a hot Asian girl who had no other function than to be a hot Asian girl. I loved her car readout monitor too. It looked like an angry ""Hello Kitty!"".

So ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" is right off the cookie cutter Hollywood action flick assembly line. People love seeing other people who look just like them in movies. So dang it, put them all in! Soon Hollywood will break down barriers in India and China, (one billion potential movie ticket buyers in each country people!), and we can get a Bombay set action movie starring some white action hero and his lovable sidekick from the Kashmir valley. Oh and throw in Suki from this flick for the love interest. Cha-ching.

As far as the racing scenes go, ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" is pretty good. The speedometers got more close-ups than some of the cast members. Actually the cars probably should have gotten credited in the cast as well. There seems to be one way to do a racing scene: Close-ups on the drivers eyes, then on the speedometer as it goes up and up, then to the cars zipping by, then repeat from step one.

As a movie, ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" gets a little more ridiculous as it goes on. There's only so many cars racing by I can watch and still say cool. It probably lasted as long as it could before dipping into vroom vroom tedium.",Dr. Gore,2003-06-10,2003

6.071428571428571,"Excellent film, although not profound","2 Fast 2 Furious is the perfect early summer diversion. The movie has no real depth and the plot isn't exactly what one would call ""complex"". However, anybody who goes to see this movie hoping for good drama is on a fool's errand. This movie is about fast cars, action, and beautiful girls. It delivers the goods. Whether or not you are impressed with the acting, I can't imagine people saying they were not immensely entertained. Paul Walker's character Brian O'Connor is recruited by the cops for a special mission. Using his impeccable drag racing skills, he is to infiltrate the money-laundering world of villain Carter Verone. Walker is joined on his quest by boyhood pal Roman Pearce and a Customs Agent played by Eva Mendes. As fate would have it, Verone needs an excellent driver to make a money run for him. O'Connor and Pearce display their skills in a ""test"" where they race several other drivers to obtain a cigar Verone has hidden in a car.     After they prove themselves, they are hired for the job. At this point, the movie just roars to its conclusion with breathtaking chase scenes and fights. I especially loved the moment in the final scene where O'Connor and Pearce have their drag-racing subculture buddies pull out of a garage and cause all sorts of confusion for the police. In conclusion, this movie is excellent. It's a very well-done, highly stylish no-brainer action picture. I thoroughly enjoyed it as it was one of the first movies in sometime to live up to the hype. 3.5 stars out of 4.",jbrolly,2003-06-10,2003
1.0,2 Bad we can't burn the negatives,"The summer of 2003 will most certainly be considered the summer of annoying sequels. It was kicked off with a bang in regards to the terribly made 2 Fast 2 Furious. Sure, John Singleton is a much better director than Rob Cohen, but this film was just badly acted and put together that no amount of strong willed direction could have saved this schlock. People were saying Vin Deisal should have been in this film, but that would certainly not have saved it. I could complain till I'm blue in the face, but the fact this piece of crap made 50 million on its opening weekend only tells me that cinema will continue to churn out poseurs and wannabes to this style of film making. Well, here is not looking forward to the likes of Charlie's Angels' 2 and the may other sequels which follow.",Agent10,2003-06-11,2003
10.0,This is a car lovers movie!,"People are either getting this movie or they aren't and depending on that they either love it or hate it.  There doesn't seem to be much middle ground.  Let's get the obvious out of the way:  Vinnie is gone, deal with it.  This movie is about cool cars, hot chicks, and guys with a lot of attitude.  Don't go into it expecting a strong storyline. This movie is all about having fun.  My only beef with the movie was that some of the supporting cast could have gotten some more screen time.  I think what is making some of it's audience mad is that this is NOT just an Import Tuner movie.  This movie is for those who love cars in general.  It features modern American cars, such as a Mustang and a Corvette, and classics such as a Dodge Challenger and a Camaro.  The main character even says their Tuners can't match the power of the classics, which I figure the Tuner crowd didn't appreciate much.  Of course, everything that is not a modified import gets totaled while none of the imports get destroyed.  I figure they will get over it and fans will release just how great this movie is.  There is a bunch of stuff to watch out for in it too.  For example, the three cars Brain races against in the beginning are the same models as the cars that won the major races in the first movie (An S2000, a Supra, and an RX-7).

7.0,Lives up to expectations,"It's hard to recall a summer packed with so much box office promise.  Aside from the X-Men sequel, other early season films have failed to live up to their hype.  Daddy Daycare, The In-Laws, and The Matrix Reloaded are just a few titles that were heavily anticipated, yet failed to deliver a complete, satisfying movie experience.  One can only hope that the Hulk, and hyped-up sequels to the Terminator and Charlie's Angels can salvage this summer series.Before I go any further, I acknowledge that movie reviews are completely subjective.  Different people like different things, and a lot also depends on your state of mind when watching.  When it comes to judging movies I tend to evaluate a film based on whether or not it lived up to MY expectations. You may disagree, but again, it's my opinion.2 Fast 2 Furious benefits from this way of thinking.  Like the original, I had very low expectations for this film.  I was very skeptical, doubting that they could hold together an entire film on the basis of ""street-racing.""  Admittedly, the acting is not great, the dialogue is almost as bad as it was in the first one, and some of the race sequences/crashes are ridiculously far-fetched.  The movie is, however, well-paced and delivers a steady supply of action and intrigue (unlike the Matrix snoozefest, a poorly-paced film which was only loosely held together by a handful of satisfying action sequences surrounded by a painfully dull plotline, horrendous acting, and an absolutely preposterous premise, but that's a movie review for another day.) I have read a number of scathing comments bashing the story's premise, but I think that the plot line was surprisingly well-developed.  You have a cast of characters, each questioning the motives and loyalties of the others, all working with and against other forces to get to the predictable, albeit satisfying, conclusion. Is this movie great? No. But I didn't expect it to be.  I was personally very satisfied with the movie experience.  It did what few films (including the Matrix, Daddy Daycare, and the Hulk) have done this summer - it lived up to MY expectations.  Oh, by the way, it's one thing for me or anyone else to state an opinion.  I have no problem with people who agree or disagree-  that's what these reviews are for.  But I think it's ridiculous when I see that 10% of ALL the comments posted for this film (at the time of this review) were all written by the SAME PERSON. It's one thing to be passionate, it's another thing to be annoying. PUH-LEEZE!",devinabellon,2003-06-14,2003
7.0,Cant compete!,Lets face it this movie is no Boyz in the Hood which is Singeltons best work which puts up in the ladder on the way to success.  I feel however that whatever goal he was trying to accomplish in this film didnt happen.  The main characters in this film are obvioulsy the cars because they are the only ones who give a good performance.  The downhill of the film was the acting of Paul Walker who I think might just need to take acting classes. This movie cant compete with its predescor.Tyrese is one of the only actors who plays his characters right and successful.  We know they can drive fast cars so what  is this is not the Dayton 500.  We have been waiting for a comeback for the lengendary director who once gave us one of the best films of the 1990's.  DONT SEE!,jmm509,2003-06-14,2003
3.0,Waste of time and money,"I have never commented on a movie via IMDb in my life, but I must give my thoughts on ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" because this probably the worst movie I have ever seen in a theatre. I am a huge car fan and loved ""Driven"", so that puts into perspective how bad this movie is. Granted, the opening race is entertaining, but after that, I should have gotten up to leave. Horrible acting, horrible dialogue, horrible story, and horrible cliche after cliche ruin this movie franchise. If you're not under 14 years old, check your brain at the door, because this movie will only appeal to those who don't know what ""cliche"" means.",xmd,2003-06-14,2003
6.071428571428571,Pop some corn and enjoy the ride,"After reading some of the comments, I thought I'd give my opinion, as I'm a 39 year old former street racer (have 11 years of total license revocation to prove it),and active drag racer (NHRA Super Street and Super Comp licensed) and can give some perspective.

**POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW**

Technical Stuff: First off, I noticed Singleton tried to give a more ""reality based"" feel to this movie (the ""warp drive"" effect of nitrous notwithstanding), as the speedometers showed speeds between 80 and 120 MPH, as opposed to the 160+ MPH shots in the first film (sorry ricer fans, but those cars are NOT that fast in streetable form). That, and the references to the Hemi Challenger and the Yenko Camaro being near impossible to beat (in a drag race yes, the advantage to the import cars would be in the cornering department). I also enjoyed the PROPER terminology used when referring to nitrous oxide (""nitrous"", ""spray""), and NOT the poser slang term ""NOS or NAWS"" (say that around real racers, and you're pegged as a ""duck"" as in a clueless sitting duck).

As to the acting, well... it looked as if Walker and Gibson actually enjoyed making the movie (look when they fight, and you'll see Paul Walker laughing), and to anybody who says ""the acting stinks, and terrible plot, etc, etc.."" I'll say tell you to relax, and as some other have said, check your brain at the door and ENJOY a fun summer popcorn flick. I'll quote another fun summer film from a LONG time ago (Hooper), ""It's only a movie for God's sake!""",racerx70,2003-06-14,2003
6.071428571428571,Fun movie but NO VIN DIESEL,"Which is ok, because the movie still works.  I liked Tyrese and actually laughed a lot at his lines.  As far as the pretty boy goes, he was ok...but that stunt at the end was way too unbelievable.  I mean, their AIM was super good to get on that BOAT.  Also, if I were transporting money, I might use a less conspicuous car to haul the goods.  Still, this was a ""fun"" movie.",DJAkin,2003-06-14,2003
6.071428571428571,a decent sequel,"A pedestrian, but effectively action-packed sequel. Walker returns to his starring role, this time as an ex-cop on the lam making a living as a freelance Miami street racer. After being tracked down by the federal government, he agrees to go undercover and help bring down a ruthless drug lord. Unwilling to take the heat by himself, he recruits old friend Tyrese—a temperamental ex-con who does what he wants when he wants. If you're looking for a believable story with great dialogue and amazing character development look elsewhere; this supercharged no-brainer is just an endless exercise of intense action scenes, swift direction, and laugh-out loud humor, but the two leads do at least make a worthy team. **½",Special-K88,2003-06-15,2003
2.0,Better than the original....,"(Spoilers) but that's still not saying much given the fact that the first film was a complete and total waste except for Vin Diesel's presence. The sequel cleverly titled ('snicker') ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" has Paul Walker being recruited by the FBI or CIA or whatever to help them catch a columbian (or mexican or whatever) drug lord (yep, no type casting here at all), so Walker gets his childhood friend (R&B singer Tyrese) to come along for the ride. A lot of car chases ensue, and I mean lots. There's no Vin Diesel this time, so the sources for acting are Tyrese (who's okay) and Walker (who makes Keanu Reeves' Ted seem like a genius. Basically the only saving grace in this movie is one sequence where our heroes pull into a parking garage that's quickly surrounded by police, only to have the squad cars of the said police crushed by souped trucks that come pouring out of the garage, then the remaining cops chase after numerous cars that come pouring out. That's about it, the rest of the movie is loud and annoying. 0 stars.",thehardyboyz2043,2003-06-15,2003
2.0,Not worth your money...,"Actually, I didn't think it was all that great. It was the same old movie with a horrible used-millions-of-times-before plot. They kinda copied Triple X because they took to outlaws, Paul Walker and Tyrece and gave them the chance to work for the police, and in exchange they would have their records cleared. There was even a scene like they had in Triple X where they drove really fast down a long road and through a village chasing down something in the water, then jumped on it. Basically the same scene. So as you can tell I didn't like this film all that much, I basically stopped paying attention half way through and couldnt believe how much I paid to see it. Tyrese in no way, shape, or form beats Vin Diesel's character in the first film. Vin Diesel was amazing and he's part of the reason the first film was so successful.In Conclusion, I gave this film a 4, all I thought it deserved.",missee7,2003-06-15,2003
10.0,Worth watching if you liked the original...,"I liked the original.  I liked the sequel.  Am I dumb teenage boy?  No, I'm a mature female.  Do I fancy Paul Walker or Tyrese?  Nope.  Did I fancy any of the chicks in this movie?  No, because I don't swing that way.So why did I like this movie?  I liked it because I saw it for what it is... a fun movie.  It didn't require the use of my brain, it didn't need me to figure out ""whodunnit"" and it didn't need me to figure out the plotline. All I did was go to the cinema on a hot Sunday (mainly to watch the movie, but also to enjoy the AC as we don't have that in England), sit back and watch some mindless fun.  I didn't bother trying to pick apart the movie and point out all the mistakes.I enjoyed the onscreen banter between Paul Walker and Tyrese.  Walker's character was given the chance to develop somewhat and it showed him as a less serious guy.  He may not be the best actor to grace our screens but he pretty much fulfilled his role.  As for Tyrese, he has potential to be bigger... I compare him to Will Smith, just slightly more aggressive than Smith!  I liked the cars and I actually laughed several times, which is more than I did during the original.  I found the action scenes exciting, but maybe that's because I am easily pleased.  I like my films to be easy on the brain, with excessive and totally over-the-top action.  Some of the characters and scenes were a tad pointless, but isn't that the case with the majority of movies?  I expected Ludacris to have a slightly bigger role, and that left me feeling a little disappointed.  Eva Mendes is supposed to be the main female lead, but she doesn't really do anything of great significance during the movie expect provide some extra unnecessary eye candy.  The latter part of the above sentence also applies to Devon Aoki's character.I went in with high expectations and they were met.  By no means is this film a classic, but I doubt that was ever the intention.  It is abundantly clear that the actors had a blast making this movie and I believe we're supposed to have fun watching.  Nothing more and nothing less.",Sodz,2003-06-15,2003
5.0,JAMES REMAR:UNDERAPPRECIATED ACTOR.,"The appearance of James Remar as Lt. Markham was the hilight of this film for me. This man has been acting in mostly character roles for over 20 years and yet nobody knows who he his. He constructs a unique character that is intertwined with his own unique personality and that's what makes him great.

The racing/driving scenes are extremely well done, but in some parts of the film, it seems a bit far-fetched. eg. an american muscle car manages to jump over a jump thing and land on the boat that they were after.

Every good thing (like a Nissan Skyline) had a bad thing (like double boost gauges that soar when they hit the nitrous... ridiculous). The plot was even less believable than that of the original. The girl was actually pretty good, since she was a major part of the plotline and even better looking than the one in the first movie, not to mention a better actress.All said, I had a lot of misgivings about this movie, but I did leave the theater feeling good, which is what I appreciate most in a movie.",redwards29a,2003-06-17,2003

8.0,"vin, you ignoramus","*Spoilers ahead, sorta* Best thing to do when seeing this movie: have zero expectations. I went in thinking it was going to be a load of crap (but, of course, watchable, due to the general lack of thought needed to see it), but it ended up being decent. Tyrese was surprisingly good in his role, as the much-needed comic relief. Paul Walker, well...he's cute. He should probably be a model, though, because then he wouldn't have to talk; his acting is a little dry and his voice makes him sadly unappealing to me. Cole Hauser plays the charismatic, deep-voiced and sadistic mobster; truth be told, he's the only reason I saw this movie. Him, and the cars. Gotta love the American muscle: especially the blue one. Old cars just get me all emotional, man. I did have a few problems with this movie, and though they weren't big enough to spoil the buzz of mindlessness and ease (every once and a while, don't you just need a movie that lets your mind rest?), I might as well bring them up: 1. Devon Aoki. She was kinda pointless, couldn't act very well, and looked oddly like a barbie-doll with its head squashed. 2. The whole finale with the car jumping off the dock ONTO a boat. How'd they know a dock would be there? Wouldn't it have been funnier if they missed by a mile and landed straight in the water, with the people on the boat pointing and laughing? I would've found that entertaining...3. Cole Hauser as an Argentinian? With blue eyes and a southern accent? Why wouldn't they have just said that Verone was born and raised in Florida? Anywho, this movie wasn't that bad, and it leaves me wondering: why would Vin Diesel decide not to do this when XXX sucked and its sequel will more than likely screw up his ""career""?

6.071428571428571,"Too ""American""","Spoilers herein.

I actually liked the original for the unexpected reason that it was intelligently stylish.

Judging as a viewer, it must be amazingly difficult to be stylish and fresh because Hollywood (and the advertising industry) turns styles into mannerisms. The first film did something pretty novel and interesting. It was in the manner of AsianTechno. And it did that in two ways, what was ON the screen and HOW it was put on the screen.

The cars themselves, everything about them, is a result of this movement which in sheer numbers of minds dwarfs any sector Europe or the US could develop. The engineering, the manner of racing, the designs ON the cars, the clothes of the drivers, the embodiment of techno possession and consumerism, even the mechanics of street pecking order. All these originated in and are firmly rooted in AsianTechno. This contrasted with our recent obsession with HipHop ganstas-and-hos and guns and gave us speed, agility and cool lime. Thin sexy girls instead of cows. Clipped smart dialog instead of thuggish mumbles.

Its a war out there, a cultural war for the styles that unknowing teens will adopt as literally who they are. To build a film around AsianTechno, particularly the consumerism of AsianTechno was an inspired idea.

There are two choices for cinematic style: either the urban Anime/Manga approach (which incidentally is obsessed with motorcycles not cars and is limited to Japan) or a more hip style centered on Kar-wai Wong, cars, realistic cinema and the mainland. Fortunately, ""Fast and Furious"" chose the Kar-wai school, especially as exemplified in ""Fallen Angels.""

Very cool, very fast, very odd cuts, ""drilling in"" to the machinery of the cars.

Well, that was then. This is now. We still have the cars, but they are relegated to the role of something to be gotten rid of because of ""location."" We still have the Asian mechanic mastermind, but he works for a HipHopper type. We still have some remnant of AsianTechno in the person of Devon, who is the embodiment of the style in the ad business. Denoting the style with her would already be a step back because she is already an ad mannerism. But even that is not enough. She goes into second place in the race and drops out of the story.

Instead, we get a post 9-11 statement on ""American Muscle"" directed by a HipHop guy who hasn't a clue about what made Kar-wai's stuff have energy. Reminds me of ""The Replacement Killers"" which similarly took a (slightly different) cool Asian cinematic style and put it in the hands of a HipHop director. Equally loud disaster.

What we end up with here is Latinos, muscle cars and Dukes of Hazard. A bigassed latina. A smarmy druglord. Sad sad sad. Old, passe. No real hip kid would be seen dead associated in any way with this.

The movie isn't aimed at anyone really above 25, and although the film has received several negative reviews from critics, it isn't aimed at oldies like them and the audience its directed at, mainly teenagers, absolutely love it. The screening I saw it at was full with teenagers and many started clapping a few times through. Yeah, the film hasn't much of a plot and is in theory a little lame, it is overloaded with eye candy that impressed everyone.

One of the few exceptions is probably the Matrix Reloaded. I personally am a car fanatic, so I quite enjoyed that aspect of the film, and if you don't even like cars, I would expect the Fast and the Furious series would not be for you. The plot was straight forward, and actually realistic. It held in the same field as the previous film, and the lack of Vin Diesel actually made sense. I don't regret seeing this film.

5.0,Better than the first!,"This film has some strong and weak points.  It has a plot right out of TJ Hooker(for those people in the 80's) and some stunts out of the Duke's of Hazard.  One does not have to think hard to watch this movie.  The beginning part of the movie is lame, the characters, 70's style, wow look at this acting, and multi cultural cast resembled perfectly the 70's PBS show the Blood Hound gang.  How lame, and dull edged, along with no imagination could they make this.  They try to grab the younger audience with everything rap style, which is in stark contrast to racing NASCAR Burt Reynolds fans.  This rap I just don't mean the music but lingo is so 90's, and been around since 88 is losing its shock, its become more of a fringe.  It reminds me of the PoP tart commercial we see in Canada,  I was waiting to see a PoP tart in one of the cars and the lead actor make that weird noise.   Some of the stunts where out of CBS, Dukes of Hazard, ie. the bridge whatever the guy won in cash would never cover the cost of his under carriage or axles.  Then the movie turns into Grand thief auto Vice city, I am sure they had this in mind.  It picks up and becomes a little more believable.  Then the 70's driving film style took over and saves this film,  movie like Cannonball, The Driver etc, and I really enjoyed the fun of it.  Especially the 2 stunt drivers in the Charger, and Camero who look and act the real deal.  It was real; they could not beat these cars with today's toned down imports, but the import could handle the corners better.  Then the movie turns into Smokey and the Bandit style with its trick at the ending, along with a very Dukes of Hazard ending, they even mention the name Dukes, where just like in the show surprising no one gets killed.  5 or 6 out 10.",mm-39,2003-06-22,2003

I think the acting from Tyrese and Ludacris could have been better yet I think Paul Walker's part was so much better than in number one.(The Fast and The Furious) The cars in this are a little unreal considering these racers who are dirt poor can afford these cars filled with Nitrous Oxide and all these different items used in the street racing world.(you also think who would bother to spend all their money)This plot could be better just like the The Fast and The Furious' plot could be. Paul Walker and Tyrese have to meet up with a rich man to spy on him while they're doing odd jobs for him in order to get they're criminal records cleared of every crime they've ever commited but in the process they run into a few ups and downs which leads to a fight to the death.
This movie plot of course involves love between Paul Walker and a fellow agent who is undercover acting as this rich man's wife, isn't that kind of stupid how an agent would get married to the man she's spying on.(that's going a little to far) This cheesey love story just get's in the way of the whole plot to this movie, in my opinion this movie could do without the romance.Although this movie is cheesey in several ways it is worth seeing.",Bobofett1010,2003-06-22,2003

Predominately, fans of the first movie (of which I am one), folks interested in cars and good-looking women, gals interested in Paul Walker and Tyrese, and folks easily impressed by bright colours. Don't get me wrong - the movie has a great sense of humour and self-mockery (something that the first flick was missing) and it's a wild ride. The opening race is amazing, and throughout you'll be impressed by the cars whether you want to be or not. Tyrese is a revelation, showing great comedy timing and it's evident that both he and Paul Walker had a blast making this sequel. Walker maintains his Keanu Reeves-light impersonation, but he's still interesting enough to capture your attention. My money's on Vin Diesel returning for the next episode (3 FAST 3 FURIOUS??? :) if XXX2 and his other projects don't generate the big bucks - set this one in Mexico, boys.

It has more plotholes than swiss cheese and it's next to nothing. If you want a good storyline I suggest you go check out another movie.Now last but not least, the dialogue. I thought it was awful. About 1 out of 2 lines ended with the word ""bro"" or ""man"". It didn't bother me a whole lot at first, but it gets pretty annoying near the end.All in all an okay movie. I rate it a 6 out of 10. Go see it, if nothing better is around.",AgentShorty,2003-06-22,2003
6.0,"2 fast 2 furious?Sure, but they forgot to hollow, 2 hammy...","What do you do when your leading man in the hottest new franchise in town decides to jump ship to become `The New Arnie' TM, even after declining a paycheck in excess of $20 million? Easy: take the other leading man, give him the rains of `top dog', throw in some of the coolest R'n'B artist around and a dash of semi-dressed females, and you've got your sequel to 2001's hit urban car flick `The Fast & The Furious'. Paul Walker returns as Brian O' Connor, who after his behaviour in the films predecessor, has found himself kicked out of the force and out on his own. He still manages to get in a few races down at the local, but his life has slowly becoming empty. Once such race goes awry, and he is caught by the local cops. They agree to release him, but not before he reluctantly accepts going undercover, this time to infiltrate a local drug lord (Hauser) who is sitting on millions of dollars from his dealings. The assignment pairs his old racing buddy (Tyrese) who himself has been recently released from jail, where Brian sent him when he was an undercover agent. Along the way, they must also rescue another agent (Mendes) who has been undercover with Hauser for years. If you enjoyed the first film, you will love this one just as much. What this one looses in a charismatic and buoyant actor in Vin Diesel, it makes up for in comedy, with Diesel's butch driver making way for a much more light-hearted, easier on the eye foil for Brian in Tyrese. His comical performance is the one of the films highlights. However, he place second fiddle to the mountains of cool cars that appear in all their glory. The races and chases are great, as action-packed and high-octane as the original, though some of them look horribly, and dissapointlingly computer generated. The other performers are also of a decent quality; Walker's boy-next-door charm shining thorough a largely undemanding role, which Eva Mendes has staked her claim as the hottest new babe on the scene, with her sexiness and charm doing her character no harm. The storyline is ice thin, with no character development whatsoever, and with hammy dialogue that would make Mr. Schwarzenegger stand up and applaud, director Singleton takes the easy way out, and pounds on the chases and fast-paced action as compensation. Which, in the end, is what the audience wants anyways, right?
A film like ""2 Fast"" is not supposed to be Shakespeare, and was never supposed to change the way we make our films in the future. Its sole purpose was to combine cars, beautiful men, half-naked women and bundles of lightening-paced adventure. On those counts, the film is the near perfect popcorn flick. Leave your brain in the glove compartment and enjoy. ***",suntorytime10,2003-06-23,2003

The film is a corny disrespect to the film media. Why this is not listed as I comedy I have no clue. Oh and Paul Walker was a bit blurry and slurred his woprds(or maybe that was me downing a few with a drunken nun). Anyways like good Irish twins we took we a drunken leak on the screen on the way out and were arrested. But boy it a jovial time ripping apart this awful, awful, auto film.

9.0,"A GREAT FUN flick, I am just here for the entertainment...","Fast cars, pretty girls, high speed chases, solid racing. What you were expecting maybe ""Gone with the Wind""? This is a fun thing to watch suspend disbelief at the door and enjoy yourself for the time its on the screen. Reminded me a lot of classic car shows of the seventies(i. e. Starsky and Hutch, Dukes of Hazzard etc.) You want some serious drama go see something else. You want an entertaining 2 hours go see this.",flash-108,2003-06-24,2003
1.0,"Slow acting, slow action","Having seen and enjoyed the first movie I had moderate hope for this one but it looks like yet another sequel that should never have been made. It's impossible to know just how bad the acting was as dialog was contrived and uncomfortable and probably wouldn't have sounded natural from even the best speakers. However, bad acting is bad acting and this was certainly about as bad as it comes. The one exception to this was ludacris who was suprisingly enjoyable while on screen but those times were too short and too far between. All of this could easily have been forgiven though if the action measured up. After all, this isn't hamlet right? Unfortunately ""2 fast"" fell short here as well unless one likes seeing gear shifts, speed-o needles, and mechanically impossible driving sequences. In the year of the matrix, the hulk, and later return of the king this one simply wont measure up to it's competition and in the lexicon of exciting driving movies (Fast and the Furious, Blue Brothers, Gone in Sixty Seconds, etc.) it doesn't even deserve mention.

************** Spoilers *****************

What really irks me are the incredibly fake driving sequences. You don't need to know much about cars to know that you can't drive at freeway speeds in reverse, most care are geared even lower in reverse than in first. HEAVY duty swerving as seen in the opening race scenes can't be done at anything higher than 40 (try it sometime but don't sue me when you roll it or fishtail right off the road). Star Wars type light speed effects don't happen at 80 miles an hour (or even 120) regardless of what you're dumping into your engine. In the final scene you see the speed-o creep past 90, 100, 110, 120 all to barely eek past a boat that wouldn't be capable of speeds greater than 25 or so. The one and only interesting stunt is the well done truck scene which is shown in it's entirety (yes, it's only about 10 seconds) during the previews.",harlaken,2003-06-25,2003
7.0,an Improvement on the first,"I much preferred this one to the ""original"".  The first movie was basically Point Break in cars !! At least this one is stealing story lines from a few movies - bond, XXX, etc. Paul Walker really needs to quit his attempts at a moustache in these movies, it really just looks daft.  He looks like someone desperately trying to get facial hair and failing miserably. That said - he does a much better job in this movie than the first. Do not go to this film expecting it to be deep and meaningful, but just for fun.  Excellent cars - especially liked the scene where the car switch was pulled... Good movie as long as you're not expecting much!",eileeshb,2003-06-25,2003
1.0,Let's get undercover and kick a maffia boss' ass,"Bad story, some nice shots but the feel of speed isn't as much as in part 1 also no one seems to know what happened with Paullie after his nice adventure with Vin. It's quite over the top with the cars so you should only see this movie if you want to have fun not I if you want to see state of the art direction or acting.",Vikash2,2003-06-25,2003

This movie had everything: good plot, fine guys (you know, every movie needs that!) and some really great looking cars. I just saw this movie yesterday and I can't stop thinking about all of those racing scenes. They were incredible. Especially the first one in the beginning. I liked pretty much everything about this movie. 2Fast2Furious might not have topped its predecessor, The Fast and The Furious, but it was a damn good movie!",PhatBlingBling,2003-06-25,2003
6.071428571428571,Just when you thought it couldn't get any better!!!!!!,"FANTASTIC! I was dying to see this move as soon as i had read that a sequel was in production.  It did not phase me at all that the Vin wasnt in it as i think he wasn't the be all and end all of the first movie and boy did i enjoy this one! I think it was far better than the first (the first was ACE too though) as it had good comedy elements and it had that good old buddy buddy feel to it. The cars were fantastic and i am glad that the american muscle cars got a show in too as i love the charger and mustang. Paul Walker did an ace job as did the rest of the cast, shame i cant praise them all in person but i hope they know that they all did a fantastic job to make an very rare film where it surpasses the original. I was gutted that they wrote off the Skyline though!!!!! Would have been nice to have given it some more glory.  I hear that the USA have just been granted permission to legally run the Scooby Impreza Turbo as opposed to the N/A 2.3 versions they have been using all this time, so for that alone i think they should make a 3rd!Anyone know if the story is gonna be continued? I would recommend it to anyone who wants to see a film full of fast paced non-stop action, oh and the undercover female cop............hmmmmmmmmmmm NICE! ;o) This is by far the best road movie ever made.  Overall, a job VERY well done and a big thumbs up to all the cast n crew involved cos it was a GEM of a Movie! I cant sing its praises enough. Cant wait to see more.............",sailesh-makwana,2003-06-25,2003
1.0,2 Corny,"My review for 2 Fast 2 Furious will be short and sweet.  I was, once again, wasting my time and my money watching a another installment in the Fast and the Furious series. If Vin Diesel couldn't save the first one, what in the hell makes you think that Tyrese could save this one?!? John Singleton disappointed me the most after making such good films such as Boyz N The Hood and Higher Learning. The sexy Eva Mendes earned the film a star.* out of ****",NYKMarin8161,2003-06-26,2003

All with neon lights big spoilers and big engines then I will be set to race legal.",hot_stuff54646,2003-06-26,2003
6.0,"2 FAST,","While I wasn't expecting greatness, I was hoping that ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" would be something entertaining and fun.  With a reported $76 million budget, the Miami flavor, and a successful sequel to blaze the path, all they had to do was not mess things up.Luckily, Singleton and Walker brought their fun and games and Eva Mendes brought her glorious beauty.  All in all, it was a good ride.With that said, there's a stunt where Walker is driving on the shore while the bad guy is offshore on the boat.  To get from point A (land) to point B (the bad guy's boat), Walker drives a car off a tiny mound, has the car turn right in the air... sail across the water... turn left... and then lands on the upper deck of the boat.  With a huge budget and hundreds of people working on the movie, it's kind of shocking nobody said, ""John, there ain't no way hitting that little mound is going to get that car high enough and far enough to land on the upper deck of that boat... much less change direction in flight."" Even worse, a bad guy takes Eva Mendes downstairs on the boat... then is nowhere to be found when Walker and Co. land the car on the deck and fight evil.  Or, maybe me chuckling after seeing the car stunt caused me to miss Walker and Co. kick the 2nd bad guy's butt. In an apparent ode to George Miller, Singleton looks like he studied the Road Warrior hero shots (camera pushes into drivers door window and we see hero driving... or... camera glides over hood and pushes in on hero behind the wheel). Oh, and the Asian girl (street racer) was cute, but kind of weak in the acting department.  They would have gotten far more juice had they gone with Izabella Miko (the Russian tease from Coyote Ugly) or Charlotte Ayanna (like Mendes, another Training Day alum).Regardless, 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS will make a huge pile of cash and it's a fun movie.  :)",javamikey,2003-06-26,2003
2.0,Not as expected.,"The first movie seems so much better after viewing this. I had naturally expected much better than the first, but this was a letdown. The plot seems almost identical to Fastlane, and the movie felt flat. Yes it had great action, but it was unrealisic to an extent that the first movie would never have had the nerve to attempt. The final car ""jump"" was so corny and impossible that everyone in the theatre was growling in disgust. I gave it a 4 just because it still hit in a few ways, otherwise it would have been a 2. Using Miami as the backdrop was a great idea, but what happened to it? I would have not even known that this was set in Miami if they didn't refer to it intentionally several times. Miami Vice made a series out of imagery...while this movie stayed indoors as much as possible? I am so unhappy about viewing this movie, because I am sure there now will never be a proper sequel to the first, because the marketability of Paul Walker will likely lure him away from another version, as it lured Vin Diesel away from this sequel. The original movie had a mood to it, that would pull you in, and this one never even got started. I would have thought with the budget and hype, that the sequel could have been better, but I guess I was wrong?",wannasurf2,2003-06-26,2003
7.0,Nice Car Advert,"I wasn't expecting great acting or a twisting plot, and I didn't get it. But that's okay cause I got lots of cars instead.Basically a long car ad, my friends complained because they got bored, but I love car chases so I didn't mind. However even I thought there was an overkill on the car front. A non existent plot and average at best acting basically let way for wave after wave of screaming engines and squealing tyres.Okay, it started well enough, a cool street race (there were corners!) but then we got Tyrese involved and the non existent plot (An excuse to race/wreck a ton of cars) got underway.Taking cues from every car chase ever, the grand end chase is probably the most spectacular, especially then warehouse scene, which is breathtaking. It then descends into Dukes of Hazzard land with the outrageous ending.I'm not going to say the movies crap, it's not, but if you want to watch something with a even a bit of plot, stay away, this isn't for you. But if seeing babes and imports cars driving at a zllion miles an hour gets your juices flowing, then buckle up for a hell of a ride.",russell100uk,2003-06-27,2003
6.071428571428571,"Fun movie, but somehow not true to the feel of the original.","2 Fast 2 Furious is a fun movie. I'd see it again if my friends were going but overall I felt somehow let down. The acting is better, the story is better, and the budget is larger. Does all this make it better?  Nope, not at all.In the first movie the entire thing was based, for better or worse, on the cars. How fast they were, what was in them, and how pretty they were. In this installation the cars were important but seemingly second to the plot-line. The producers have forgotten who the movie appeals to.  The movie appeals to gear-heads, action fanatics, car guys, etc...not people who generally care too much about a love interest or who's selling drugs to whom. Those details should be the vehicle for the movie, not the entire movie itself. The producers left their original audience in the dark on this one in favor of a higher ""class"" of audience who cares about details storylines and plot holes. They dropped the ball because those sort of people were avoiding it all together because they remembered the superficial nature of the first one.Who does this appeal to?  Nobody now.  The lovers of the first one may not enjoy it too much, and the audience being catered to in this one won't see it anyway.  Too bad, because it's not a bad movie. Just a misguided one.The action sequences are fast, but not fast enough to compare to the original. The cameos are fun but seem somehow out of place. The plot is well thought out but not executed to the level that it should be. At least there are more diverse cars in it than the first movie. It's not a  Honda commercial anymore.  Nope...now it's a Mitsubishi commercial.See it, but go see it on cheap night.",yamatek,2003-06-27,2003
1.0,Junk!,"Pure Junk! Another piece of hollywood crap! No wonder Vin Diesel stayed away.  Each actor can only say 3 words total per scene.  Horrible acting, super bad plot, junk junk junk! Stay so far away from this movie..",nitemare21,2003-06-28,2003
4.0,2 bad and 2 lumpy,"Ok, so it was probably not going to be the oscar winner every movie maker wants, but actors can only do as the director tells them.  I hope they have a wider talent than this movie portrays, cos they is dead in the water if not.The cars had talent, but even that wasn't used enough.  Ok, there were some nice lights and a lot of noise, but it looked like the budget was lower than the first movie.  That's what made the first movie great- real nice cars used well.  (If the actors demanded all the budget for themselves, they were very wise; if not, very dumb, but it killed the film).Unfortunately, the story which made the first movie appreciable was non-existent.  I just didn't care about any of the characters.  'Leading lady', as such, Eva Mendes, I just didn't give a hoot about, let alone get attracted to.  However, Devon Aoki - the unbelieably cute and sexy ""Suki"" - was awsome, but completely underused.  I will definately be watching her future productions, I just pray her acting comes through in them.Finale: Worth watching if you've the time, but if there's anything better on, watch that.  (It's a pity, cos I really liked the first one.)",HoraceBury,2003-06-28,2003
