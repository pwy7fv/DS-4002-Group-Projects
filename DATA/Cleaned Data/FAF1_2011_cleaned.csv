7.0,The start of a franchise that revolve around cars and a big break for two actors,"This movie was a big hit when it first came out in theaters, especially with it's budget. It's actually pretty obvious why this movie was so popular, mainly because of the suped up cars with girls and some aggressive racing and bits of action. In another words this is a popcorn flick for most guys and despite the plot not being that good, it still has elements which keeps the movie from being boring or dull. It's one of those movies where it's better to shut off your brain and just accept that entertaining and yet stupid stuff happening on screen in order to have a good time with it. This is also the movie where Vin Diesel and Paul Walker got their big break, and so this movie is the biggest thing that has probably ever happened to them especially when it comes to being in the movie industry. So yeah basically to sum it up, this is a film with a passable plot but has some thrill rides to go with it. Overall the execution was well done, it's a stupid/cheesy flick and yet it's cool and entertaining. Like one of Vin's line in this movie ""You break her heart, I'll break your neck"" it's lame but stands out although most of this movie is pretty cheesy for the most part.7.4/10",KineticSeoul,2011-04-28,2011
7.0,"It coming at you, FAST AND FURIOUS.","Action movies consists on three things, fast cars, good chases and good actors and characters. In The Fast and the Furious, that is acceptable for a action movie. Vin Diesel stars as a street racer, who's friends dominated the streets with tricked out cars and exciting races on the streets of L.A. Paul Walker plays a cop, tracking Diesel. Together, they form a duo. They so discover that the street racing is causing theft to occur in L.A. So, it's up for Walker's character to tracked own these robbers before they hit again. The Fast and the Furious is a good action flick for the summer because it combined the energy level to high as the chases become greater and greater. As for Walker and Diesel, these guys know how to act. They know what's the game is. When the game is on, they go at it. Their formula together is very good and the action sequences are really astonishing. As for the car chases, they are somehow very neat and well made. All in all, The Fast and the Furious is a heart pounding, fast and furious ride from start to finish. â˜…â˜…â˜… 3 stars.",blazesnakes9,2011-05-07,2011
3.0,"Shallow movie about hot cars and girls - big problem: they get the ""cars"" part completely wrong!","OK, I get it, the movie is only to show hot cars and girls, so I won't comment on the thin, improbable and hole-riddled plot. Instead I'm going to list just a few thing that are wrong about the cars in the movie, which I'm guessing was designed for viewers who largely have no clue about cars, maybe because the target audience is slightly too young to drive, i.e. early teens? Well, here goes: 1. NOS seems to be the solution to everything. There is a lot more involved to make a car go fast, yet the shop is full of NOS, NOS, and more NOS parts! Oh, and exhausts, because everyone knows loud exhausts are the 2nd most important thing that makes a car go fast ;-) 2. The car ""tops out at 140"", let's add some NOS (surprise!) and it'll go faster. If your car tops out at 140, NOS will not help you one bit. Maybe you're running out of gears, maybe the engine should be built for higher revs, but NOS won't change anything about your top speed! 3. The best qualities of the type of cars driven, modern Japanese cars, are cornering and handling. What do they do? They have a drag race on a straight instead - wrong car for this purpose, any average US muscle car will beat the hell out of the Jappa there with less money spent on it (and conversely, a modern Japanese car will leave an average old US muscle car in the dust in an actual race involving lots of corners).4. Double-clutching ... oh dear, what a complete and utter nonsense! You double-clutch if you have an unsynchronized transmission - very unlikely - and even then only when you down-shift (which you never do in a drag race!) 5. 140mph is fast at the end of a quarter mile, but not that fast in principle, there are *many* European and Japanese cars that have a top speed around that figure or higher, even ""family cars"".6. Nitrous oxide doesn't run out after a few seconds (lines in the movie indicate a racer has used his NOS boost ""too early"").7. If Vin is serious about drag racing, he wouldn't have a sound system weighing a ton in his car. Note, there's a scene where the geek is explaining how to save 2-3kg of weight on the car they're building later on, so on the other hand they do seem to be interested in saving weight.8. Towards the end, Vin drives the Charger and does a monstrous wheelie. You don't get that kind of traction/wheelie on anything but big fat racing slicks, yet the car has pretty normal tires on it.9. While we're at it - the tires are smoking while he does a wheelie?! Wheelie means you have grip. Smoking tires means you don't have grip. Which is it?!? 10. A car like that Charger would definitely have a wheelie bar, especially since a wheelie as big and exaggerated as the one shown in the movie would just cost you time.11. If you're serious about 1/4 mile times, you're not going to drive a FWD car, but rather a RWD or 4WD car.12. Surely even the boy-racer scene with Jappa cars finds cheap stickers tacky (no pun intended) and would opt for real airbrush or pin-striping on their prized cars (there is one scene where they put decorative stickers(!) on a car).13. Why would you rebuild a burnt out Supra?! Apparently their labor is free and restoring the car is done in a leisurely afternoon or something. Oh, and the engine is so special that $15k turns it into a 10s car! These are just off the top of my head, and I'm not even that knowledgeable about cars myself, so I'm sure there's plenty more wrong. The movie doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't, but at least they should have gotten the ""car"" parts right in what is meant to be a car movie! ...or did I get that wrong and I just watched a very long commercial for NOS (which is a brand name ;-) ?",nichtssagend,2011-05-29,2011
10.0,Well Worth Your Time,"Truck loads are being hi jacked and the LAPD has sent in an undercover cop into the street racing world to find out who is doing it.

This movie is outstanding on many levels. The climatic failed truck - jacking scene has to be one of the top 10 trucker scenes of all time. When we watch it at the truck stop,we all cheer for the truck driver who got away with his load intack,although with a radiator full of buck shot. Well done Rob Cohen,ken Li,Gary Scott Thompson,Erik Bergquist,David Ayer,Unknown Actor,Matt Schultz,Paul Walker,Vin Deisel,Johnny Strong,Michelle Rodriguez, and Jordana Brewster. If I missed your name and you had something to do with this scene,i.e. stint coordinator or editor,i beg your forgiveness. If you had something to do with this great trucker scene,Well Done.

10.0,True blockbuster.,"Firstly, this movie became a masterpiece and a blockbuster of all times - not because of it's plot, literally it is plain, but because of the scenes with the fast, tuned, hot cars, having neon lights and nitrous which was something people had never seen before. There had been many racing movies but this one is unique itself because of the illegal racing stuff. In my opinion this movie is very underrated because of it's low ratings and disliking reviews complaining about plot, but - come on, guys this ain't a movie whose purpose is to having a nice plot. If you want a nice plot movie go watch Star Wars but the purpose of the F&F franchise is to see some fast beautiful cars, hot chicks and affairs which are not about love but something more... I admit that the writing was not well-made but the defense of this disadvantage is that action films don't need perfect writing - go watch a good drama instead if you want a good writing.

What I mean is that this movie is the origin of the illegal street racing movies and was the first of it's kind. Then we saw Street Racer, Born to Race and even the failure of the year - 200 MPH. But all those movies were inspired by the Fast and the Furious franchise. The plot is plain and predictable otherwise it is different than any plot in any other action movie made before the movie. The acting was great - all the actors made the deal especially Paul Walker and Vin Diesel, whose roles made them famous and the reason being famous now is only the movie. The special effects, that every action movie need to have, are immaculate and the stuff used in the movie is perfect. In addition, people in real life became inspired about tuning their own cars and this movie is the reason about that. In my opinion if you're a fan of cars you should definitely watch the movie and will truly love it. If you expect too much or are a drama/comedy person you will also not be disappointed but also not so satisfied. ""Damn"" I can say so many things about this movie that literally mean a defence of itself but I would repeat myself so I will skip to the summary.... The movie is a blockbuster itself. It is plot is plain and predictable but because it's unique itself and is origin of all illegal street racing movies so this makes the meaning of the plot inconsequential. The acting is awesome as immaculate are the special effects too. The writing is typical for an action movie, despite being awful but what really makes this hustle and bustle movie amazing is it's uniqueness and beautiful adrenaline among fast and tuned cars. Recommendation - just watch if you're big fan of cars and adrenaline. Don't expect much if you're not.

Plot - mild, plain, predictable though it is unique and doesn't need to be amazing. 6/10.

Acting - Amazing; Vin, Jordana, Michelle and Paul do very nice job. 10/10

Writing - as plain as the plot is though it's very typical to the classic action movies. 6/10

Performance - Immaculate special effects; Very beautiful designed cars; Spectacular racing scenes. 10/10

OVERALL: 8/10, though I give it an excellent personal TEN because it is literally my favourite franchise.",Achylles,2011-10-23,2011
9.0,It's more than just an action movie.,"This is a great movie. Far from being superficial pulp, this movie has a complex plot. Vin Diesel's performance is tremendous; his screen presence is dominating. He succeeds in carrying the movie. Although the movie contains lots of glitz, it also tells a story that deals with themes such as loyalty and betrayal. The rest of the cast is excellent too, especially Jordana Brewster and Paul Walker. Michelle Rodriguez is as usual wonderful. It would be easy to dismiss this movie as being little more than a live action cartoon, but the movie really is full of surprises. It has several intensely dramatic scenes, some of the most incredible car chase scenes, and some deeply esoteric verbal exchanges fraught with emotion. Whether it's Vin Diesel pouting or Paul Walker being heroic, the results are same: nonstop action, intense dialog, and interesting characters, all of which together produce great entertainment. It's more than just about automobiles.",PWNYCNY,2011-10-24,2011
7.4423076923076925,An action packed ride that will please gear-heads and non-enthusiasts alike,"Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), a police officer, goes undercover at Harry's high performance auto parts store, The Racer's Edge, to infiltrate an illegal street racing subculture and figure out who is responsible for hijacking trucks loaded with expensive electronic merchandise. Armed with a highly modified Mitsubishi Eclipse, O'Conner enters the world of street-racers to meet the leader of a notorious gang led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), who are suspected in the hijackings. After helping Toretto escape the police when their race is broken up, O'Conner wins his way into Toretto's good graces. Things go awry, however, after the gang attempts another hijacking, and O'Conner is compelled to move in and stop them. The NOS injected action/adventure film also stars Michelle Rodriguez (Letty), Jordana Brewster (Mia Toretto), Chad Lindberg (Jesse), Johnny Strong (Leon) and Matt Schulze (Vince), and is sure to please fans of such genres as well as many a gear-head.

But The Fast and The Furious is, of course, not without the requisite, if not cliché, femme fatale motif to add a little suspense. Sure, Mia Toretto is not exactly fatale, but her role is just a docile variety of what you expect in a movie such as The Fast and The Furious: to create inner conflict in O'Conner and unwittingly—in her case at least—to challenge his priorities. Unlike other undercover movies such as Point Break or Breach, though, The Fast and The Furious will not keep you on the edge of your seat in suspense. But that is fine here. Despite the covert operations and confused loyalties of O'Conner, action is the point here—car action to specific. Everything else is supportive filler to keep the story moving.

What is perhaps one of the best treats of all in this movie is the final drag race. It is a classic stop light drag race, complete with a speeding train through a railroad crossing and an obstructing tractor trailer to add extra layers of excitement. After all, what good is a car movie without at least a few melodramatic crashes and close calls of the predictable variety. Who would have guessed a train would go speeding by mere seconds after O'Conner and Toretto go airborne—inexplicably—over the train tracks, or that a tractor trailer would just happen to impede a lane traffic as the pair go racing down the street at full throttle? Even though the special effects are simple here (no CGI), they still add to the excitement. Indeed, the action packed plot is focused on catching a gang of street racers who hijack trucks to support their lifestyle. The cars, then, are naturally as much a part of the supporting cast as the actors themselves, and the special effects and stunts are what make their action sequences so much fun to watch, while also supporting the story line.

In the end, The Fast and The Furious is well worth the addition to any action/adventure enthusiast's or gear-head's DVD collection. Even though the film may not be a classic hit, it has a well cast ensemble of actors who fulfill the sub-cultural niche this movie seeks to portray, using a fictional undercover story line of cops and robbers",elijaman2002,2011-12-11,2011
7.0,"The Fast and the Furious (2001) - Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, Start Your Engines!","Known as the first film in the ""Fast and the Furious"" series, this thrilling street-racing action flick brought a start to a daring and explosive franchise. Paul Walker plays LAPD officer Brian O' Connor, who is sent undercover to investigate a gang of street-racers, all portrayed by Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, Jordana Brewster as his sister Mia, and Michelle Rodriguez as his girlfriend Letty. But then, he starts having feelings for this particular group, and has no idea whether to bust them or not. This really is a thrilling, and exciting film. Who doesn't enjoy watching car races, hot ladies, and rocking music? The race scenes are exciting and fun, and they steal the whole movie. But I don't really think this movie should be called an ""excellent"" movie, but instead a ""cool"" movie. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are two of the toughest guys ever seen on film, so it was really fun watching them racing cars, shooting guns, and beat up people. But neither one of them gives a special performance. The story may sound like a crazy concept, but it is original. It's neither a remake or a reboot of classic car race films. Anyways, if you're interested in watching a classic movie with chase scenes, hot ladies, explosive bombs, and tons of violence, you won't be disappointed. This is the perfect movie to invite your friends to, and watch this with everyone. ""The Fast and the Furious"", in my review, ""exciting premise, a thrilling ride"".",nickmesafilms,2012-01-01,2012
5.0,OK film - did it encourage the 3 guys who died last month racing on my freeway?,"I didn't want to see his movie, but my friends really wanted to see it bad. It was sold out, but we got into the 12:15am show time and the theater was packed! AT 12:15!! I don't understand what the appeal of this movie is. A bunch of fast cars? Fast cars does not a good movie make.The dialogue of this movie was terrible. There wasn't anything interesting said the whole time. My friends (who LOVED the movie) tried to defend it saying that they talked like real people talk. Well, if I want to see real people talk I'll go to the barber shop or something; somewhere where I don't have to pay $8.25. Such lines as ""It doesn't matter if you win by an inch or a mile, winning is winning."" and ""I'll have the tuna fish,"" are the most memorable, and believe me they really sucked.The plot hardly got in the way of the blatant attempt to make a movie just for the reason of a bunch of cars going really fast. And audiences couldn't WAIT to see a bunch of cars going really fast. Maybe these people should watch NASCAR or something, then they won't have to worry about ignoring some piddly plot. If you want to see a GOOD movie with cars see Bullitt.",howardbrown,2012-02-01,2012
8.0,Great great film!,"I gotta say, I love this movie, and the stunts are really amazing. Special FX include cars driving under speeding trucks and staying in control, plus a wheelie from a dodgy corvette.

Anyway the film was Dynamite!!!! The story of the lead guy being undercover and gaining the trust of the crooks is quite good but here it could have been better. There was one moment I will remember above all and it's the moment that I reckon was the most tense in the entire film. Most people won't remember it but I just happened to. Anyway I won't give any details but basically it's when he blows his cover to the lead crook. The look on the bald guy (Vin Diesel)'s face gave that scene more suspense than any other. But then it's just wasted after that.

The film ends with us perhaps not knowing what will follow but it's not hard to work out what probably would have done if it were continued a bit longer.

The acting was very good. That Vin Diesel bloke was criticized by a lot of people on this site but there's a bit where he talks about his dad's death and i thought he shined then. And the others weren't that bad anyway.

Overall the film is worth a watch if you're looking for a little action that's easy on the mind. Of course it goes without saying that if you like cars this film is for you.",cooper1-3,2012-03-19,2012
10.0,The legend that started it all!,"""The Fast and the Furious"" is a great, great action movie. Love Vin and most of the others, with the exception of Walker. You can see why they are working on Pt 6 now. Booyaaaaaaa!!! If you're into action and drama, then you'll love this movie. The racing scenes are very cool, and the in-your-face action keeps you on the edge of your seat. It entertained me throughout the whole thing, and I'd have to say the acting is a lot better than said by others to be.. The only one lacking to me, was Paul Walker, and, well, we've always known he wasn't much of an actor.. just a pretty face. However, the rest of the cast did an awesome job. I highly recommend this movie.",wayne-cook-326-133712,2012-03-27,2012
8.0,The one that started it all!,"""Fast and The Furious"" is one of those kinds of movies that polarizes people into two groups: those who loved it, and those who hated it. I happen to be one of the ones who loved it, I unlike many other reviewers, thought the dialog was written fine, Vin diesel is a good actor, and that a large amount of this movie's appeal is in how the car scenes are shot.

In a lot of movies, when they try to throw cars into the mix, you get bored, the shots are too centered, it gets boring, every time they race the cars here, the screen shakes and gives me (and anybody else who loved this movie) an awesome rush. All in all, don't believe what ANYBODY tells you about this movie, it's really the sort of thing that you need to see for yourself to know if you love it or hate it. See it for yourself and make YOUR OWN opinion.",judges-kell65,2012-03-28,2012
10.0,"If you haven't seen it, you live under a rock","This movie has by far the best acting in any racing movie I've ever seen. Vin Diesel plays his role extremely well in this film as well as Paul Walker (Brian Spilner) who acts as an undercover cop trying to bust Dominic and his street racing gang. This movie also has some of the best cars and probably the most cars I've seen in a street racing film. In almost every scene there's cars. The film takes a dramatic turn in the end which gives you a rush and thrill as if you were actually in the movie. All in all, I think this movie is perfect for any racing fan or car enthusiast however, it's also extremely entertaining and I think anyone would enjoy this movie.",hiddenwave93,2012-04-11,2012
6.0,good movie ruined by terrible actors.,I give this movie a six because it really is a pretty good movie. The story line is new and interesting and it is very entertaining in my opinion the actors just ruin it though. Paul Walker and Vin desiel can not act at all so everything seems so fake and unbelievable just because of them.This movie is about an undercover cop who goes undercover to infiltrate an underground street racing ring. Though as his friendships with these people grow closer and closer he slips from being a cop to being a criminal.This movie was still pretty good even despite the robot like acting of walker and deseil. Overall I still think its worth a watch.,deatman9,2012-10-21,2012
6.0,Too Fast & Furious for me,"We are all tired of fast cars as a central plot, but this is where it pretty much all started. The Fast & Furious epitomizes Racing Movies. Granted, they aren't my favourite type of movies to watch, but this one really hits the nail on the head.Foolproof storyline, star studded cast (for it's time) and of course, testosterone. Fast and Furious reeks of it, but I can only take so much. Yeah sure it was moderate action but, whether this was before HD or not, the way the cars looks when traveling at super speeds were far to fake for me. It looked cheesy and the green screen was obvious. Plus the acting of some of the cast was sub-par. I mean, who would of though that putting Ja Rule in a film would be prosperous. Mediocre at rapping, what makes you think he would be auspicious for a motion picture.I can't ignore the giant pink elephant in the room so lets get right to it. Vin Diesel. The bravado that follows Diesel in ever film he appears in is present here. In one of the ending scenes where Paul Walker's character reveals something shocking, the look that was given by Dom (Vin Diesel) was chilling in every sense of the word. He definitely out shined the rest of the actors. But Johnny Tran (Rick Yune)really surprised me. He made for a very compelling antagonist and I really wish he was is in the recent Fast & Furious'. All in all, you must see this revolutionary racing film. It has it's flaws but what movie doesn't? But what do I know I'm just a 15 year old boy.~Caesar Drake",y-a-z3689,2013-01-11,2013
8.0,The beginning of it all,"This is the movie that created a brand new mega movie franchise. Generally when there's movie franchises they make movies in the form of trilogies. But later this year when Fast and the Furious 6 comes out it'll be the sixth movie in the series which shows the level of box office appeal the series has to be able to pump out an average of 1 movie every two years is quite impressive. The only other series doing that kind of productivity with different directors on basically a once every 2 year rate is the James Bond series.Vin Diesel who outside of his other series Riddick movies generally puts out mediocre to bad performances was basically made to play the role of Dominic Torretto. Same goes for Paul Walker, normally when I see he's going to be in a movie I don't bother watching it. But somehow when these 2 guys get together in a movie about driving fast cars with hot girls it turns into a guilty pleasure.",Maniac-9,2013-01-18,2013
7.4423076923076925,Turn Off the Brain and Enjoy,"The Fast and the Furious (2001)*** (out of 4)Brainless but entertaining action film about cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) who goes undercover to get inside the street racing crowd so that he can try to bring down a group hijacking semi trucks. He gets in good with Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew but of course they don't know his true identity. THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS isn't to be taken serious because if you did then you'd see one flaw after another in regards to the story itself. Like a lot of summer blockbusters, this one here has had way too many Red Bulls as every single scene is just over-the-top and has some testosterone going overboard. That's not to say this is a bad thing because there's no question that the film remains entertaining as a pure action movie as we're given some likable characters as well as some great racing scenes. I think most people are going to be coming to this thing for the fast cars and the various chases and this here is where the film won't let you down. There are some terrific stunt sequences, although I will admit that a few of them appear to be too much CGI and not enough actual driving. With that said, there are some great ones here including the ending, which I won't spoil here. It also doesn't hurt that we're given some characters that we can like even if I think the screenplay doesn't do a couple of them justice. Both Walker and Diesel are very believable in their roles as is Michelle Rodriquez, Jordana Brewster and even Ted Levine in his role. I will say at times it's somewhat hard to root for the main guys even though we do like this. This is especially true during the final sequence when the truck is being hijacked. Still, THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS is a fun ride as long as you don't expect some serious piece of art.",Michael_Elliott,2013-02-27,2013
10.0,A perfect 10...,"I just saw it for the thousand time, and it's still as good as the first time I saw it. Rob Cohen is a pure genius, he truly is. These movies are magnificently awesome and I'm going to tell you why. No Spoiler alerts I promise.Let's start with the basics. The script and plot is close to perfection. Everything from Action, comedic feuds, deceit, romance and amazing surprises. It has a little of everything and a lot of the rest.The characters' difference is brilliant. The background of them is hidden beneath the surface of someone completely different. They're just amazingly entertaining. They're personalities is even better. I can't say anything else because I'm out of words; speechless.The action scenes are incredible for a movie like this. I won't say to much about them though, but if you haven't seen it yet, do so. The first scene when you see how good Brian drives is good and when you see the spark he has, and how his driving improves throughout the movie; nice, very nice. The turning point is pretty good too, but you'll have to find it yourself because I am not going to spoil your movie-experience. The twists in the movie are good, and there is more than one as well. Everyone has secrets, and the secrets are what make this movie just as good as it is. Without the secrets the movie wouldn't be worth watching. OK, let's talk about the acting. First, Mark Vincent (or as you may know; Vin Diesel), I'm a big fan for a reason. There's never anything to say on his acting, so I won't even get into how amazingly amazing he is. So, the rest of them, I am a little iffy on their names so I am just going to call them by their character names. Brian, or the guy who played his role in the movie did a great job and so did Mia and Vince. There wasn't any bad acting in the movie, only good acting and some awesome acting.The mix of secrecy, trust and romance is pretty damn good. I'm running out of adjectives. So I'll just try and wrap this up and give you my concluding opinion and rating of this movie.This movie is definitely worth watching. I really and truly recommend you to watch this movie and its following movies. They are worth watching, ask anyone who've seen them they'll tell you the same. Personally I think it's great and awesome and so does my pal here who watched it with me an hour or so ago. For my rating, based on everything I wrote and didn't write, I give it 10 out of 10 stars. Why? I couldn't find anything negative about it and since I still enjoy watching after all these times I've already seen it it's probably worthy of a perfect 10.Rating: 10/10Thanks for reading my review.

9.0,Start of a Franchise!,"Who would had thought that this movie that came out in the midst of the blockbusters for 2001 would think nearly twelve years ago that the producers of these movies would have a franchise on their hands.

But O Connor is lured into the fast cars and Dom's sister played by Jordana Brewster! But as he and Dom form a reluctant than easy friendship over time. O Connor must choose and is conflicted at the same time between his duties as a cop and one that of a friend.

5.0,This movie is driving me crazy. It's an awful skid mark on film.,"The Fast and the Furious is just a movie with gas fumes of half-baked ideas for a popcorn flick. The movie is simple mindless full of hot chicks and fast cars. 'Petrolheads' probably did like it as it was the sleeper hit of 2001, and spawned many sequels. Still, the movie had mixed reviews, and in my opinion, they didn't go all the way in entertaining the kind of audience this movie was aimed towards. In the movie, there were few street races and not to mention the fact that the street racing element is just dressing for a bland, generic plot of thieves stealing commercial goods. If I went to go see a racing movie, and found myself watching a Point Break (1991) rip-off. I would be disappointed. The story goes like this, rather than having intense full-throttle action fun, awesome high-speed stunts, and full-on pedal to the metal intensity, the movie goes into another direction by having an undercover cop, Brian (Paul Walker) infiltrates an underworld subculture of Los Angeles street racers looking to bust them for stealing goods. He soon befriends the leader of the group, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and begins to question if he should turn him in, or let him free for one last ride. The movie is supposed to be fast and the furious, but it's not- it's slow pace like a grandma driving in the fast lace in the highway. The limit racing in this movie are over so quickly they're just boring as the movie puts countless amounts of filler scenes of talking that don't further the plot. There are unfinished sub plots. The movie spend all that time developing a love interest, and then you aren't going to let us know what happens? What the hell, movie! I know the movie was going to be for the low-brow, so I didn't expect a life lesson, I want to entertain. This movie was flat out lackluster. There's not enough action. The movie has a lot of flash, but the characters are dull and not interesting enough, with cars replace for personalities. That is, of course, with the exception of Toretto, who thanks to that scene about his dad and Diesel's performance, shines above the material. Still Diesel's acting is mediocre, at best. I presumed they were going to sell them off for upgrades to their cars and bikes, like Toretto was doing with his stolen goods. It's not made clear, though. It doesn't make much sense, either. The cars in the film are not that real to the real deal. Doing a wheelie while burning the the rubber on the rear tires of a 900hp Charger at the same time is simply not possible. First of all, don't expect any kind of realism from this movie. I was dumbfounded when the Brian's Honda floorboard came out of his passenger side when he used his nitrous boost and then his engine blew smoke. Next scene, after this, he picks up someone who was running from the cops with his car and drove away as if it's brand new. I didn't know Brian's puke green car came with a healing factor modified in his engine. What is with each of the ""underground street races"" have so many spectators on long streets block off. Not once, you think the police would just look for a large street block off and arrested them. The women in this movie are just drop dead hot, but it's weird for them to be hanging out at underground racing. I don't see many women there, at less not as hot as Jordana Brewster. The movie is supposed to be about Import-car racing which is a spectacle started by Asian American auto enthusiasts. How does ""The Fast and the Furious"" pay tribute to the sport's Asian American heritage? Make them the villains in the film. The movie has a lot of loud noises, and soundtrack full of the worst music artist at the time, Limp Bizkit and Ja Rule. The techno rock is a bit annoying. Like the 1955 film, The Fast and the Furious which is not based on, but took the title rights from, this movie is less for smart adults and more for kids who shell out money to pimp their car and add a 4"" diameter exhaust to it, thinking it's cool. Don't get me wrong, I love cars, but you don't see me endangering other drivers by driving fast illegally on city urban street. I like driving fast in the country side where it's less dangerous for other drivers. I think the movie glorified the illegal street racing way too much that it's a bit unhealthy. I think the movie is a bit far fetch from reality where most illegal street racers end up getting killed due to crashes or other car racers car-jacking your car before you can race. So it's not worth it. People like seeing cars go vroom and potential cause untold amounts of property damage. That must be it. Still, there are better movies than this. Go see the chase scenes in Bullitt (1975), the French Connection (1979) or Ronin. (1998). Even modern movies like Drive (2011) are better than this movie. If you have to watch the movies, go rent it, don't buy it. I wouldn't advice thinking too much into this, it's just mindless popcorn flick and also don't complain if you hate it, cause I did warn you about seeing it. It's still driving me up the wall.",ironhorse_iv,2013-05-15,2013
7.0,A good fast paced action film,"To go in and watch The Fast and Furious, it is a lesson in expectations as it is obviously not a masterpiece, and you should not expect it to be either. it does exactly what it says on the poster though and the film is fast and the action is furious.The story of Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) who is a undercover police officer. Trying to breaking on to the Street racing scene. Through Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) so he can bring down a crew who are hijacking trucks. The thing with the film is that in a lot of ways it is terrible. I'm not a Rob Cohen fan, of all his films this is probably the best of his work in my opinion and only challenged by 1996's Dragonheart. In acting terms Paul Walker is a good looking guy but lacks real acting talent and charisma on screen. Vin Diesel though does have good screen presence, and at times I think is an underrated actor. The supporting cast is generally OK except for the insufferable and thankfully only in it for a short period Ja Rule, and the definitely not very intimidating Reggie Lee as the main protagonists henchmen.What is surprising and actually good about the film is that it does have a nice simple plot and develops the characters as we get to know about Dom's father and his childhood, and see Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) and Brian fall in love. The Car chases are decent and again are practical effects, which are better than CGI Green screen chases uses in some of the sequels. Praise also has to made of the final sequences involving the final hijacking, the chasing of some drive by shooters and the final race off. which were very thrilling and kept you on the edge of your seat until the end.I can't say i love this film, because i don't. But i did like it and enjoyed the ride while it lasted.",paulsrobinson,2013-05-21,2013
7.4423076923076925,"Hot Cars, Hot Girls, Hot Action, What more could you want?","I don't remember when the first time was that I saw The Fast and the Furious but it dosen't matter because it gets better with each viewing. This movie is filled with what guys want to see; Hot and fast tricked out cars, beautiful women, and kick ass action sequences. The world that the characters live in in this film is the world we can only dream of, to race in cool tricked out cars with dozens of beautiful women surrounding you and cheering you on. All of this is what I love most about this film but I also love the cast; Vin Diesal, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster all clinch their roles. If I were to pick my favorite cast member I would have to go with Michelle Rodriguez because not only is she a talented actress she is beautiful and bad ass in everything she's ever been in and this is probably my favorite role of hers. This is a movie were you really don't have to care about the plot because all the eye-candy and fun of this movie is the cars, girls, and action which is enough to pull you into the driver's seat. The cars are fast the action is furious and that's why this movie rocks.",daniel_velker,2013-05-22,2013
8.0,"The Start Of A Very Famous Fhranchise,","The Fast And The Furious is a great movie with a pretty good storyline and a cast that stay interested in their characters from start to finish,and some great car chasing scenes.This movie is the first Fast And Furious movie,and it is still going today,it is a very hit and miss film series,but the fifth is definitely the best one yet,and everyone has very high hopes for the sixth.Vin Diesel is the breakout character in this,he plays his character Dominic with great passion from start to finish,its hard to believe they did the second and third without him (with the exception of a brief appearance in Tokyo Drift).Fans of action movies and cars will get a great kick out of this movie.An undercover cop gets involved with a gang of street racers in LA in order to bust a hijacking ring,but he soon becomes close friends with the racers.",lesleyharris30,2013-05-23,2013
8.0,Fast & Furious Beginning,"This is first movie of the Fast & Furious franchise it has a solid plot and a nice finish scene which leave place for next movie. It's a great movie for all, especially for car lovers. Movie is full of tuned cars, hot girls and races. Old school street racing (1/4 of a mile, NOS in cars). Cars like Toyota Supra, Honda Civic and American classic Charger. It is nice treat for all car lovers. When you hear that engine sound and that NOS boost you just wanna get there and race. Racing and chasing is pretty much realistic. But movie is not all about racing it gives connection between main characters that will last trough other movies. It is very underrated movie. I rated it 8 cause of his lack of action. It has nice plot so you won't get bored at all but there is something missing. All in all I recommend this movie for everyone who is interested in cars you will enjoy it.",BearGlove,2013-05-27,2013
9.0,Great modern classic!,"There aren't many movies over the last dozen years to have a bigger impact on society than this one. The Fast and the Furious glorified street racing and made the Honda Civic and the other cars featured in the film must buys for teenage boys across America. The reason is pretty obvious, the movie is outstanding. The cast of Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, and others is outstanding and the story is really interesting and unique. The plot and characters are all really well developed, creating an immersive viewing experience not often seen in movies under two hours. The cars and race scenes are fantastic and the action has you sitting on the edge of your seat. The only negative for me was some of the cinematic effects. The director tried to get cute and a lot of those effects actually hurt the scenes, not helped. Nonetheless, those few sequences aren't enough to ruin the film and the entertainment value for the movie is still sky high.",Bruce722,2013-06-01,2013
6.0,Not really all that good.,"Last year I rented FAST FIVE despite not really caring about the previous flicks. I had only seen the first film when it came out and some of TOKYO DRIFT on TV. I gave the fifth film a shot anyway because the trailers made it look really fun and it got good word of mouth. To my surprise, I enjoyed it. It was a nice fun stunt car heist flick with no pretensions of being anything other than it was.So here I am, watching the first film and I quickly realize why I didn't embrace the series during its initial films. This first installment is basically POINT BREAK with cars, but without The Buse. The first race is pretty fun at first but after that it just didn't do much for me. It takes itself too seriously and Paul Walker isn't really much of a leading man to carry the drama this flick tries to inject with the whole thing with him being torn between friendship and duty. Boring.",tmm_8705,2013-06-28,2013
9.0,One of those underrated movies,"This was an actual 'movie'. The sequels were just entertainment takes. People forgot about the actual contents of this movie.

The main part of the movie is the trust-and-suspect-relationship between (undercover agent-) Brian and Dominic with his team. This is a red line in the movie and made you want to keep watching.

Somewhere along the way, you lose awareness of Brian's mission and start respecting Dominic's team. You want Brian to get into the group and be with the beautiful cute girl. It is about 'the family'.

It was also about Dom being a unique character who tells you about his past, his father's race, the 10-second-race story and all. It was exactly how a movie about cars, races and action should be. Simple but powerful and beautiful.

This was all build up really well. In a cool traditional (unforced) way, we were introduced with cool cars, cool people, street-racing and stuff.

Before the end, a series of events happened that made you very excited. These events that happened are somehow connected and brought a sort of realistic thrilling experience. Here, the acting skills were superb and the drama in the scenes were pictured in a pitch-perfect traditional way. Brian was a lot tougher here than in the sequels where he was like Dom's slave or something.

It's beautiful to see Brian and Dom at the end: Brian betrayed him and should arrest him but instead, they do the 10 second-race and don't know what to think about each other. This race was one of the most memorable scenes in film-history. After Dom hits the truck and survives the air-spinning of his car, Brian gave him the keys of his car, his car that has just also finished the 10-second-race. So, he finally gave Dom a 10-second-car and by doing that, he officially shows that he is not going to arrest him anymore.

Somehow, he knew that Dom should not be sent to jail all along, even though he appeared to be a trucker-thief after-all......",Jashhh,2013-07-05,2013
7.0,Pretty good high intensity movie,"I had never seen any of the fast and furious films before I just watched this one recently and had heard from some friends that they were absolutely amazing! I finally decided to watch the 1st one and see what it was all about. Brian O' Connor is a cop who is sent undercover into the street racing world to bust some crooks who have been stealing millions of dollars worth of electronics to pay for their extremely fast (and furious) cars. I enjoyed watching it but it was not a jump and amaze me completely movie. I enjoyed how Brian O' Connor was not revealed to be a cop until around 30 minutes or so into the movie. It made you feel for him that much more as he tried to gain respect in the hard undercover world of street racing. The races were very high intensity and fun to watch, even if I do not know hardly anything about cars. Vin Diesel has since lost his appeal but he was great as the big bad leader of the street racing team around him. Overall, 7/10.

6.0,made for the petrol head generation,"Now that part 6 is out there and still getting very positive reviews I found it time to pick up the series. I'm not normally into all that macho stuff but because it's involving cars I must had a closer look to the success of the series.Once over I thought to myself, why is this a hype. It surely isn't going to win any prices and Vin Diesel (Dominic Toretto)isn't the kind of actor that gives great performances (well maybe in the Riddick franchise). But then again I was surprised to see some well known faces from the genre I like, horror sci-fi and exploitation, and see Michelle Rodriguez (Letty) was here doing what she does best, playing the hard girl. Even Jordana Brewster (Mia Torreto) who started off in a horror called The Faculty (1998). This flick had so many technical aspects that people who are tuning their cars will get a tuned hard-on from watching this flick. But for me, I wasn't really attracted towards the story. Paul Walker (Brian O'Connor) did well and in fact it's all about him. But that is only clear in part 2. To be honest, it's a no-brainer with some action here and there but also with to many clichÃ©s like the cop falling for the sister of the bad one, and having the Stockholm Syndrome towards the end. I didn't find it really going fast and to so furious, well I was.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5",trashgang,2013-09-18,2013
7.0,Cars look cool and Babes look hot,"Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) leads a group of friends and family to street race in the LA night. Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) is a cop working undercover to infiltrate his gang of suspected truck robberies. However he finds himself falling under Dominic's charisma and for Dominic's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster).There is a lot of silly action, and unrealistic story lines. This is purely style winning over substance. The cars look cool and babes look hot. But it's the Vin Diesel presence and Paul Walker pretty boy looks that provide the heart of this movie. The boys have amazing chemistry and the gang feels like a real family. The story is almost unnecessary.",SnoopyStyle,2013-11-02,2013
6.0,A movie for car fans and not only...,"""The Fast and the Furious"" is the first movie of the rest that it followed and I think that with the second one were the only movies which did not have so many visual effects.In this movie we watch an undercover police officer (Paul Walker who plays as Brian O'Conner) who gets involved with street racing and becomes very popular from that. Vin Diesel makes a really good interpretation as Dominic Toretto who plays as a street racer. Also good interpretations made in this movie by Jordana Brewster (Mia Toretto) who plays as Dominic Toretto's sister and Michelle Rodriguez (Letty) who plays as the girlfriend of Dominic Toretto.I liked very much ""The Fast and the Furious"" movie because it shows us how is to be in this world of super cars, races, speed and all of that stuff, and makes you also feel all of these one by one.",Thanos_Alfie,2013-11-08,2013
8.0,Mainstream fluff but this first instalment works for them,"The first Fast and Furious movie I stumbled into by accident was Tokyo Drift and much to my surprise I loved it. So now because I have heard so much about how great the latest instalment was I have been going back and watching them all. The first film certainly has a strong appeal to it. Car movies are not necessarily my thing, I don't know a lick about cars except how to drive (and my wife would say even that is questionable.) Still the original film in this series also is one of the only ones I have seen outside of Tokyo Drift that is still truly about fast cars and racing. The series eventually evolves into more of a heist/criminal underworld sort of spin but this is truly about the cars. Right off the bat you're dropped into the action and there is some truly excellent action scenes. The characters are not brilliant but they are well defined and interesting despite being very predictable and stereotypical. One thing the Fast Furious series forces down your throats is the idea that this group is a ""family"" and will do anything for each other. They start this concept in this movie and then repeat it over and over and over again. A smarter series would let you feel that devotion and friendship with character development. But it is what it is, a simple action flick that entertains.

This cast has made their bread and butter with this series. Vin Diesel is a star from this series and a few other roles but mostly this. He fits into it like a round peg into a round hole. He is a good anti-hero and his rough tough as nails charisma works in the movie. Paul Walker also made his name in this series. He is the yin to Diesel's yang. He is softer spoken, the red blooded all American type who is undercover within this gang and becomes one of the family. Walker is a little stiff in his performance and he certainly isn't flexing any major acting muscles but he is a necessity to the story and his chemistry with Diesel works very well. Jordana Brewster is Diesel's sister and Walker's love interest and she does decently. Her character gets very little development but she has a purpose and serves it well. Her chemistry with Walker is solid and their romance is definitely worthwhile. Michelle Rodriguez is Diesel's love interest and I think they actually have great chemistry, very hot on screen but she is very underused in this movie. I was surprised she got such a name from being in this because she is definitely a supporting character and way in the background most of the time. Rick Yune is decent but completely underused and under developed as the ""villain"" o sorts. He could have been much better but the character is too weak. Chad Linberg does a terrific job in a very small role and gives one of the stronger performances especially in a supporting role.

The film relies entirely on its stunts, fast cars and action scenes. The cast and performances are adequate at best but thanks to a constant stream of adrenaline it ends up being very entertaining. Rob Cohen has a history as a director of relying on adrenaline to make his films. He might be one of the most shallow directors in the way that his movies have very, very little depth. These films, especially this one, is the definition of mindless entertainment. You have to turn off your brain and sit back and enjoy the spectacle. I'm not in any way saying there is anything wrong with that because I was thoroughly entertained. I don't quite understand the massive following this series has but this time I was pleased with the film so what can I say. Be ready to be entertained but not overly impressed. 8/10",Robert_duder,2013-12-08,2013
7.0,The film that made a lot of actors popular,"Upon first reading the title, viewers would get the first impression that this film involves just racing cars. In a sense, it does but in a different way than your standard track race of 99 laps. It involves much more than that and to demonstrate this, a cast of actors were chosen for this franchise that have taken the genre of driving cars to the next level. This is the movie that brought several no name actors to the spotlight. The most obvious is Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. And what almost seemed like would be a strange mashup of racing and detective work, turned out to be a fairly solid film.Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner, an undercover cop who is trying to help the FBI capture a group of road bandits who end up plundering innocent truck drivers traveling down highways. To do this, he digs deep into the underworld of street racing where racers of different backgrounds and revved up cars come together for a common cause. The thrill of the ride and all the benefits that come with it; sex, drugs, respect and money. As he slowly assimilates with his surroundings, he befriends a man named Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family members. There he begins to investigate who is behind the truck jackings.This is actually not a bad plot at all. The writing does have its weak points, which will be touched upon but let's start with the positive. I enjoyed how O'Conner has to come to grips with himself and who he's going to support. This shows that he's a human being and has a conscious. The same goes for Dominic Toretto, in a different way though. Toretto must come to grips with himself knowing he wasn't the person he once was. Both characters are from very different worlds yet they share a struggle that resembles each other. That struggle is being human and knowing who you are as a person. Sure it's not believable in every aspect but at least it lets the audience know that these characters do have a mind of their own.The weak part to the film is the final scene. All there is to say is that it is too abrupt. It completely detours from what the plot was centered on, along with leaving a few subplots open for interpretation. But was it needed - no. It would be nice to see some closure on more than one subplot. Surely if this franchise didn't earn a sequel then where would the conclusion to this story be? Hard to say. But if there's one thing that helps make up for that are the racing sequences to this movie. Even if you're not a racing fan, the action scenes should entertain. I mean, who doesn't want to (or enjoys already) driving over the speed limit for fun? Driving at high speeds gets the adrenaline pumping and makes every action much more intense. So if you don't enjoy that kind of thing, this movie isn't for you.The editing by Peter Honess who also did The Shadow (1994), L.A. Confidential (1997) and Highlander (1986) did a good job here as well. The shots are well connected and will keep the attention of the audience quite easily. The score produced by BT isn't anything to praise over though. Some action scenes didn't even contain music, which was odd because you'd think one would want to make that scene more intense by adding music. And although he doesn't create a theme for the franchise, his music does match the tone and attitude of the film. And for this kind of film, as long as it maintains that, that's all that matters. Because there is also contemporary music inserted in various scenes, BT's music transitions well into the contemporary music. It's good.It lacks logic in a few areas and has a loose ending but the car scenes and actors help them overcome that. Plus it has some unexpected character development that helps give the main characters a good amount of charm.",breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,2014-01-13,2014
10.0,Simply best movie ever,"Not only because it was shot at my hometown (Los Angeles CA) but, it has every essence of a great film. This to me is the best movie of all the FF franchise. This movie touches action, love, hate, friendship, adrenaline etc. It has a great storyline to keep you entertain. This movie I believe was very successful not only because during that point during the American culture Auto Tunning was reaching its peak but because of the actors selected. At that time these were not world wide icons and had not been involve in a blockbuster movie that would tattooed their careers in Hollywood. Finally I just want to point out that I am no movie critic or someone who studied in order to criticize a movie, I am simply an average Joe that likes to see all kinds of movies but, specially action movies been The Fast and the Furious my favorite movie of all times. Have to say that my first ever DVD (or movie for that matter) I bought with my own money was this FF movie.",eskyy10,2014-07-02,2014
5.0,The Fast and the Furious,"One of the most overrated ridiculous franchises ever? well you get what you pay for right, you see the trailer, you see fast cars and slutty girls, you know what you're gonna get. Apart from the visuals, you see who directs this and you know not to expect a great deal, Rob Cohen...a low rent Michael Bay who makes trashy flashy CGI filled flicks. But who knew how far this would go, how long this dumb adventure would last and why is it so popular?

I imagine it appeals to the young generation, fast cars, hot chicks and lots of huge stunts, I guess you could say its 'The Dukes of Hazzard' for the modern era. Unfortunately originality is not on the menu, the plot...a gang of fast car, street racing adrenaline junkies/petrol heads are hijacking trucks utilising their driving skills. Undercover cop infiltrates this street racing world posing as a fellow fast car petrol head to try and find out who is behind the hijackings.

Wait a moment...a gang of surfer adrenaline junkies are robbing banks (although not utilising their surfing skills). An undercover cop infiltrates their surfer world posing as a fellow wannabe surfer to try and find out who is behind the robberies. Yep, this film is 'Point Break' but with cars instead of surf boards.

None of it really makes any sense though, Toretto seems to own garages and a property yet never has any customers or does any work, yet he's clearly loaded. He owns an array of cars that are all worth a fortune, all heavily modded and would cost loads to maintain and insure yet he treats them as if they were meaningless and crashes them left right n centre. Money seems to be no object to the characters in this film, oh I just smashed up my Mitsubishi with about 20K worth of modifications to it, oh well I'll just turn up in the next scene with another. Oh my Dodge Charger means everything to me cos me and my dad built it and put tonnes of money n love into it...meh I'll just race it against a train, no worries.

Its also amusing how all the street racers drive around in car posses, taking up the entire road, yeah like that wouldn't attract the police. Oh and the police clearly have trouble catching these guys and their cars, OK, well why not drive around the suburbs and look for the houses with top line modded Jap cars parked outside. Yes they park their illegal fast cars in the street outside their abodes...oh dear.

Now as I said you can't expect much from this film, its clearly style over substance, half the film is merely imagery of car porn and scantily clad ladies hanging around next to them. The acting is hilariously bad from everybody, I've haven't seen so much posing, swaggering, hardman attitudes and general showing off for a long time, (usually reserved for gangsta hoodie type flicks). Hordes of wannabes crowd around the main actors in the street race scenes all looking desperate to get on camera for five seconds...and its obvious. All the young super slim females look stunningly sexy (err kids film?) yet have no clue what on earth is going on, oh and then we have a sweaty looking Michelle Rodriguez...yikes!

Despite all the high fives and god awful bling the main crux of the film, the cars, is pretty sweet. If you are into cars such as myself then its fun purely for that, if you like Japanese super saloons then even more so. Take note kids this is about fast cars, no BMW's, Mercs or Audi's required. This is probably the only area of the film which is remotely interesting, there is a really good range of modified Jap cars here and not just top line models either, some nice retro gear. Of course this is a Cohen film so there has to be a bit of CGI in there somewhere, blasting through the engine as it ignites, not a bad idea but it looks hokey.

The sequences where they hijack these big rigs are stupid, they don't make much sense, why not just stop the thing? The finale is even dumber, again just stop the truck! or shoot out its tyres maybe geez! Everything is naturally predictable and cheesy, plenty of tight vests, muscles and tattoo's. Vin Diesel shouts a lot, Rodriguez scowls a lot and Walker does his best Keanu Reeves impression. All this and hardly any guns in sight! that's because its a watered down action thriller folks.

The big crash stunt at the very end involving Vin Diesel and his souped up Dodge Charger is admittedly very cool, best little sequence in the film really...I had to watch all this just for that?! Well...the scene where they smoke the Ferrari had me smiling, Italian rubbish!

5/10",phubbs,2014-11-22,2014
3.0,Underwhelming from Beginning to End,"Set in Los Angeles, The Fast and the Furious follows Paul Walker's character, an up-and-coming street racer whose cocky antics land him in a race he loses. After saving Dom (Vin Diesel), who is in charge of a small group of racers and owns a garage, the two become good friends. Paul Walker is actually an undercover cop trying to get evidence against these racers as many of them attack trucks on highways and steal their cargo.What sounds like an exciting plot is ruined by lackluster pacing and, at least for me, a lack of excitement. Cars, guns, tits, a pointless shot of two girls kissing, beer. It's all the kind of things that fourteen year old boys tend to masturbate too. And that's not to say the film is childish (which, let's face it, it kind of is) but it is built to appeal to a crowd that I don't belong to. The actual racing of the film is drag racing, which does not translate to exciting pieces of action. Driving in a straight line toward a finish line and pressing a button for nitro is not fun to watch and I felt the opening drag race between Walker and Diesel had some pretty poor directing. It looked obviously sped up and I can understand it was done that way to actually allow us to see the cars, but it looks pretty stupid.As far as characters go Brian O' Conner (Walker) is as boring as they get. The romance between himself and Dom's sister could be interesting for character interactions if the characters themselves were worth anything. Dom himself is cool if only because he's supposed to be. You can easily dismiss every character here as none are truly worth remembering.And then there is the pacing I mentioned before. It starts off moving at a decent clip but slows dramatically in the middle. The final twenty minutes are a mishmash of endings with a climactic scene on the highway followed by a climactic chase through the streets of LA and finalized with a climactic (and pretty pointless) scene of drag racing. There are some loose ends that needed to be tied by the end, but it's done pretty poorly and doesn't feel organic. It just feels like the writer wanted to jump from here to here to here with nothing to lead to that next scene.The Fast and the Furious is pretty dumb and juvenile, with really nothing to offer aside from a few sweet cars. It's a lackluster film that you'd be best off watching on TV.",sn319,2014-12-06,2014
6.0,"A fun, if brainless, start to a successful franchise","Never in a million years would I, sitting in the cinema (with my mum and stepfather, oddly enough) back in 2001, think that the auto-porn I had just witnessed would kick-start a hugely successful franchise due it's seventh instalment next year in 2015. Not that I didn't enjoy the 90 minutes of homoerotic machismo, endless gear-stick changes, scantily-clad gyrators and a cameo by Ja Rule - I actually found it highly entertaining in a Point Break (1991) sort-of-way - it's just that how much of an audience can a film about cars draw? Lots, it would seem.Undercover L.A.P.D. officer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is assigned to infiltrate a gang of street-racers led by the notorious Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) after a series of high-speed truck hijackings using pimped-out Honda Civics. A highly competent driver himself, Brian uses his skills to befriend Dominic, while falling for his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster). After saving Dominic from the police, Brian earns his respect but not that of his crew, and when Dominic proves himself generous and loyal to those who offer him the same, Brian must choose between protecting his new friend and arresting the criminal he has been assigned to bring down.The Fast and the Furious' script is often bad enough to make your ears bleed. This is a film where words of wisdom are offered in the form of ""it's not how you stand by your car, it's how you race your car,"". But it's delivers on what the title promises, and the action scenes are well-staged and it's nice to see real metal bend and break in an increasingly CGI-reliant marketplace. It's loud and often crude, but the two leads of obvious limited acting range prove likable and actually generate some chemistry. It's difficult to say where the franchise will go after the sad death of Paul Walker last year, but this first instalment was a fun, if brainless, start.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",tomgillespie2002,2014-12-15,2014
2.0,Overrated and over-hyped,"I believed all the hype when The Fast and the Furious first came out as everybody was talking about how awesome the movie was. Upon hiring this out on video I felt totally cheated. The Fast and the Furious is one of the most overrated and over-hyped movies I have ever seen. As far as I'm concerned this is just brainless, action packed, testosterone fueled eye candy designed to attract teenagers who need lessons in how to act cool. Following the total disappointment of The Fast and the Furious, I vowed never to watch any of the sequels.If you have seen Point Break (a far more enjoyable movie), you get the idea of what the whole movie is about. Basically it is about a police officer played by Paul Walker (for a police officer in his late 20's, he behaves like a teenager who is too cool for school) who goes undercover to infiltrate the illegal street racing scene in order to investigate a series of hijackings led by Vin Diesel, who is the leader of the street gang responsible for the hijackings as well as the undisputed king of the street racing scene.The rest of the characters are nothing more than one dimensional testosterone filled, swaggering gangster show offs and super sexy bad girls.The Fast and the Furious is peppered with many lame one liners. ""I live my life a quarter mile at a time"", takes the cake as one of the worst one liners.Although The Fast and The Furious is still a popular movie with a large fan base, there is very little to like about this overrated, brainless and over-hyped rubbish. I'm very surprised the franchise has continued on, however I still think that surely it would have run out of petrol by now. Perhaps one day, the franchise will drive off into the sunset for good.2/10",Cinemaniac1984,2015-01-04,2015
9.0,Nostalgic,"I saw this movie first in 2003 and was instantly sucked into the series, i've seen fast five and fast six which did this movie justice but i don't think they can duplicate the feeling i get from watching this film. it feels so much like the time period it was shot in and the chemistry all the main street racers share in the middle of this movie feels gone forever. i recently watched this movie again after Paul walker died because i feel that was the final nail in the coffin on my hope for seeing another movie that felt like this. i like all f and f movies in the series especially the newest ones which are surprisingly more entertaining to me and that 2fast and Tokyo drift but the new ones are like their own movie without the same flow just like this movie is and I'm sad to see it pretty much gone forever but at least they created the new movies and created them well so we have more than just the first few rip Paul walker.",YT_RealJoshTv,2015-01-15,2015
7.0,Rehash Of Point Break With Street Racers Instead Of Surfers,"I had never actually seen this movie. I had seen most of the second one (I found it OK) watched the third one (was bored to tears) and I lost interest in the franchise before I was dragged to see the 6th movie, which despite not knowing a lot of character development, I enjoyed.However prior to the 7th movie being released, SkyMovies are showing all the movies, so I decided to see what I had missed out on!! Plot In A Paragraph: LA street racer Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) falls under the suspicion of the LAPD for a string of high-speed electronics truck robberies. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) an officer of the LAPD, joins the ranks of Toretto's highly skilled racing crew undercover to convict Toretto. However, O'Connor finds himself both enamored with this new world and in love with Toretto's sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster) As a rival racing crew gains strength, O'Connor must decide where his loyalties really lie.Although essentially ""Point Break"" with street racers instead of surfers, this is easily the best movie of the franchise (of the movies I have seen) not surprising with it being the first (they usually the best) As with ""Point Break"" the villain (Patrick Swayze in ""Point Break"") is much more interesting than the hero. Vin Diesel has charisma in spades, Paul Walker is likable and an attractive enough lead, Michelle Rodriguez is tough and sexy whilst Jordana Brewster is absolutely gorgeous. The racing scenes and action set pieces are well directed, the dialogue is a bit weak and clichÃ© at times but overall this is a lot of fun.",slightlymad22,2015-02-20,2015
8.0,Great movie.,"I've been watching the first five movies in the series recently. Must say, all of them are great movies if you're into cars and action. Really not that much to say, lots of action, lots of cars and really entertaining to watch. Actors are/were great, according to me Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are/were great actors. Too bad that Paul Walker is gone now, he was one of the best if not the best actor in the series according to me. Although all the actors were great but Paul was probably my absolute favorite. Very short review, I know, I can't find many bad things to criticize about this movie. Great actors, full of action and lots of awesome cars but not the greatest movie according to me, just a great movie that is entertaining to watch is all I can say really.",Jonathan-K_97,2015-03-19,2015
7.0,the first ride,"It's strange that one of the best franchises in movie history started off with Vin Diesel stealing a bunch of VHS players. Make no mistake about it, under the corny dialogue, awful soundtrack, horrid direction, and a general sheen that makes it clear that this is a 2001-ass movie from 2001, this is also at its core a Fast & Furious movie. So in preparation for the impending release of Furious 7, let's look how the film that started it all held to the franchise's tenants of Life, Cars, and Family.Life: Although the ""I live my life a quarter mile at a time"" mantra is corny, I think it plays well in the streets of the film's world. A world where respect is everything, but that respect has to be both earned and backed-up with actions. It means taking big risks, knowing your priorities, but also living in freedom of choosing your own destiny. While Dom's arc here is learning to live with that freedom, by his own code of honour, and the consequences and all it entails, Brian's arc is about earning that respect and choosing how far he's willing to go to get it. It may not seem a lot, but I think it speaks a lot to their arcs throughout the entire series, especially when you see how awkward Brian is at the beginning, knowing he'll eventually become one of the coolest and most respected white dudes on the planet later.Cars: Although originally envisioned as a movie about street racing, the film actually grinds to a halt when people stop to race. Director Rob Cohen is as bad at directing as he is at acting (As that Pizza Hut guy annoyed by street racers) and manages to make the races both boring, but also hideous to look at. He adds several horrible effects to each racing scene to convey speed and excitement, both CGI and otherwise, but it never feels, or looks right, and they also never sound right. Seriously, when people aren't talking, Cohen turns the film into some god-awful ""nu-metal"" or ""rapcore"" music video. All he needed was to add some crunk, and he would have completed a devil's threesome of best-forgotten 00s music genres. What is good however is how Cohen handles the heist, which the series would eventually realise is much more interesting than racing, which they prove here. Cars drive under trucks, people jump from cars to trucks, and people jump from trucks to cars. It's nothing the series wouldn't do better later, but it's still edge-of-your seat classic action, complete with a last minute save by our hero, Brian. As for the cars themselves, the only truly memorable one is Dom's classic Charger, which plays heavily into his back story.Family: Again, this movie is strangely best when people are talking, and not racing. The film obviously establishes the code of honour and of respect, but it's also about family, which the series is ultimately about. I forgot that they go into Dom's back story here, and why family is so important to him as he establishes one in the absence of his father, while being welcoming to all who gravitate towards him. His code of family really drives the film, and his accepting of Brian builds both Brian's character of being a good man and saving Dom, but also Dom's appreciation of Brian not leaving him behind build's up Dom. Family doesn't leave each other behind, and they watch each other's back. The film tries to make us think Brian's desire to help Dom is Mia-based, but I think he just really wants to be apart of that family, and Ted Levine even says he has to make a choice about which family he wants to be apart of. He kind of chooses the police in this film, but his actions here come back where he finally makes his choice in Fast and Furious.Overall, if you can get past the horrible direction and how dated the film is now, there's actually a lot to like here from the above and beyond character work, to the heist gone wrong. I never cared for this film when it came out, but looking back it has the early shine of the elements I love of this series. It's flawed, but I still like it. RIP the great Paul walker",Tyson14,2015-03-28,2015
8.0,The fast and the awesomeness ðŸŒŸ 8/10,"These people sure are fast. And furious. I'm a big of the fast and furious series. Sad to hear Paul walker died. Loved that guy. He was the best of them all. I love racing. Action, and lambriginie cars. This movie has it all. Dom is fast and strong. Vin deasel was perfect for the role. Same with Brian O. Coner. I thought him and Mia were gonna get married but they didn't. It also had a lot of hot girls. They always do. But I was surprised it was rated PG 13. I thought it should've been because of the profanity. But it was great anyway. But the film wasn't really about Dom. Mostly about Brian. If this wasn't good the furious series never would've started. Even though it's just Action for action, it was entertaining. Also, I learned a lesson from this movie. The most important thing in life is to drive around in fast cars catching bad guys with your family.",sult-186-356694,2015-04-14,2015
9.0,Awesome Movie..One of my Favourites from collection :),"Awesome Movie.The best of the Fast and furious collection in my opinion.The best thing is watching the whole collection and then returning back to the first one , that is when you really truly appreciate it for what it is..Seeing Paul walker,Vin diesel and all the other actors together really puts a smile on your face. The only thing i honestly didn't like was, there just wasn't enough action, but then again there isn't too much action like the new ones which just drain your life tbh. Such a great movie which focuses on the main idea of bringing family together.If you haven't watched it your missing out and i suggest that you get onto it straightaway.. Hope you enjoy it as much as i have .. :)",seldaibrahim,2015-04-18,2015
6.0,Good start to a great action-packed film franchise,"I love FAST AND FURIOUS movies, so I thought, ""What if I reviewed these movies?"", so I will review each film from the original film to the new film.So, I begin my second franchise review with the original 2001 film, The Fast and the Furious.The Fast and the Furious was not only released on June 22, 2001 to financial success and mixed reviews, but it also launched the careers of nearly all of it's stars, including Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, who would later become household names, as well as Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez.The film is directed by Rob Cohen with a screenplay by David Ayer, who wrote the 2001 film Training Day and co-wrote this film with two other writers including the creator of the franchise, Gary Scott Thompson.The film follows undercover cop Brian O'Conner who must stop semi-truck hijackers led by criminal and wanted fugitive Dominic Toretto from stealing expensive electronic equipment while developing a relationship with Dominic's sister, Mia Toretto and forming a friendship with Dominic.That is just a quick summary. I won't go into too much of the plot, because a lot of people should know what is the main premise of the story in this film and the other Fast and Furious movies. The franchise would later go to move away from the underground street racing plot into a plot much more cooler with the heist of $100 million dollars, gun fights and brawls and the movie that would change this franchise and bring new life into it would be the fifth entry in the series, released in April of 2011, Fast Five.The story is just really cool and amazing, but is not Oscar worthy, but the dialogue is the movie can get a little weak on a few occasions, but not throughout the whole darn movie.The action is just top-notch and the car chases in this film is as intense and action-packed as they would be later on in the franchise. My favorite car chase is at the beginning of the film and at the end of the film involving Dominic and Brian driving.The acting is just dreadful, but not all of it is. I will give credit to Vin Diesel, who plays Dominic Toretto and he pulls it off wonderfully, but while it's not Oscar worthy, he does show emotion, drama and laughter into his character. Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz, is great in this film and she would remain in that part for the other films and she would play in James Cameron's groundbreaking special-effects extravaganza Avatar and in the 2002 action-horror / zombie movie film based on the survival video game, Resident Evil.The other two that also does a great job is definitely Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster, who plays Brian O'Conner and Mia Toretto, and they do a very decent good job with the material written for them and they have such a great chemistry on the screen.Dominic Toretto's team members are just good. The actors who play the people in his crew is just incredible, with the exception of Matt Schulze as Vince.The music and soundtrack is really cool and Ja Rule is in this film, playing the role of Edwin and he provides music on the soundtrack.Overall, The first and original FAST AND THE FURIOUS is really good, but can get a little confusing in a few areas. I give it a 6 out of 10. It's not the best score, but certainly not the worst. This film is worth the watch and worth buying on DVD and Blu-Ray or watching on basic cable and Video on Demand or Xfinity Streampix.",joshuadrake-39480,2015-04-24,2015
8.0,The beginning of reckless fun.,"Ever since the first Fast & Furious films came out, I never had a look at them like they're untouched new millennium movie gems. Back in April 2015, I've seen Fast & Furious 7 and instantly loved it so much that it's favourite movie of that year! When that movie became a monstrous box-office smash, I have planned to watch the whole franchise from the very beginning. With that said, It's time to review The Fast and the Furious, a solid start of the movie franchise ride!In the movie, we have the legendary Paul Walker and Vin Diesel who both did fantastic performances throughout. I also have to mention that the variety of tuned cars in this movie is pretty unique. We have the Supra, the Civic and more which can be perfect for car lovers (like me). Speaking of cars, the car chases and races are quite fun to watch. Although there were less than I expect but it's still fitting. The music by BT is another thing that fits well in the movie, as well as the songs. They give us the music theme of tuned car racing. Finally, the pace is in an acceptable speed of over 100 mins, just the way I like it.Now that I watched Fast & Furious 1 & 7, the journey goes on as we head on to 2 Fast 2 Furious! If you haven't seen the films and if you like to watch them, hop in the car and get ready to burn rubber!Film Score: 8/10 - Great",bigconoruk,2015-06-05,2015
6.0,A racing movie with slight depth,"Rating-6/10The Fast and Furious is a racing movie, with crime, that also serves thrills and spills all over the workshop. This is the kind of movie we so often dislike but for me, this isn't dislikeable and is actually an OK piece of film, a kind of ""give it a go"" kind of movie. The whole show is pretty well made and no one can deny the stunts involved aren't fantastically done, and the plot is actually not half bad at all.Brian O'Conner(Paul Walker) is a cop racing in street races, trying to infiltrate racing gangs and the like, and to be fair Walker does it kind of nicely. I did feel out of the main cast that Walker feels the most uncomfortable, but he still manages to lead the movie out well enough. Vin Diesel as the gang leader Dominic is OK too, he actually outshines everybody here and his acting skill really comes through for me here, proves what he has in the locker.Rob Cohen directs this a bit OK, not great but he steadies it, the film could have been more on point at times but nevertheless he still catches the right feeling the script gives off. And on that note the film Is written much the same, missed opportunities here and there and massive cheesy lines can harm it, but I think by the end of the story, your hooked on the adrenaline junkie action, rather than the wording choices. The movie has a glitzy look about it, this is Hollywood through and through and yet that doesn't matter, it feels raw enough to be believable and the stars of the movie are not famous enough for this to be yet another big budget action thriller movie, that tries too hard to be cool. The cars are for me not that nice, the one thing that really gets annoying after a while is bright green cars etc with racing stripes of fire, the cars go fast and this is good for petrol heads, but the look of it is pretty awful.I said about the stunts and there is no denying the stunts are good, there not gravity defying like so many of the sequels(Fast and Furious 7 has just left cinemas at the time of this review), they are well done and basic, sure the effects used in the cars whilst racing is ridiculous, but the fast crashes and kind of crazy things that go on, make this exciting and personally I enjoyed it quite a little bit.You know I hear a lot of people claim this is ""only for the boys"", but please disregard that, not only it being sexist but also that this actually contains depth in the story, not just mindless racing. I mean the depth is pretty high up, this only just scrapes the surface but it still has more than the cars. I felt the plot which I will not ruin for those who haven't seen, is good and it makes this kinda fun but at the same time thrilling, you honestly don't know what will happen, and although the story does play out rather basic, It still contains a fun story.Overall this is one fast paced movie I can recommend, now don't be won over by it like so many can, this honestly isn't a masterpiece of any kind, but still worth a view. I didn't feel bored at any times, all my focus was on the characters and how they develop and I think that you too can enjoy it, If you focus on one particular part, and not the cheese that this movie truly is.",willcundallreview,2015-06-06,2015
6.0,"Fast cars, lacklustre plot","Over the years, I ignored the hype about the Fast and the Furious franchise, until the 7th film came out and I thought to myself that it's about time I got caught up with the series. So I went back to the original Fast and the Furious from 2001, which I originally catch glimpses of when I was 8 years old, but I remember the plot being too complicated for me to follow so I didn't enjoy it as much.The Fast and the Furious lives up to its namesake. Fast cars and furious action that has spurred the cult following for the past 14 years. Aside from the souped-up cars and racing scenes with no seemingly no real purpose, the plot is dry with many loopholes. This film is not for the serious and critical movie goer, it is the typical man movie. I can see why it has earned itself such a following over the years, but this movie wasn't my cup of tea. I've been told the 2nd movie is a lot better, so I remain hopeful.",hoxjennifer,2015-06-14,2015
7.0,Aptly named,"I hadn't seen this since '01, and frankly I wasn't all that impressed at the time. So much so that I skipped 2 and 3, and watched 4 only because it had solid buzz. And then of course the franchise evolved from a 'Point Break' rip-off (and I mean beat for beat) with street racing substituted for surfing into Ocean's Eleven for the Red Bull generation. After enjoying the fifth one on DVD I actually caught the last two at the theater and had a blast both times. So with all that in mind, I revisited the original with some trepidation. How would a movie I obviously didn't care much for the first time hold up against its more popcorn-style sequels? The answer; surprisingly well. Though it lacks the over the top action of the more recent films, the movie itself moves along at a brisk clip. Diesel and Walker have really good chemistry, with the former really carrying the flick on his V-neck clad shoulders (much as his 'Point Break' counterpart Patrick Swayze did). Diesel's Dominic Toretto has become a rather somber, mumbly character of late, but here he's downright jaunty by comparison. I'm not afraid to say that Paul Walker was a ridiculously good looking man, and honestly that may have worked against him a bit. He never did get much respect for his acting, and while I wouldn't say he was exactly Brando, he did well when he was in his wheelhouse, and this is directly in said wheelhouse.

It's not going to win any awards for originality or brains, but like many of the films in this franchise, it's a lot of fun.",Fluke_Skywalker,2015-07-02,2015
3.0,I am getting old,"Awful, awful. I avoided seeing any of the Furious movies for over a decade and maybe it was because of the teaser trailer. Maybe it was because it didn't show anything about what the movie was about or maybe it was because the movie itself wasn't aimed at me as an audience. I was almost thirty at the time, but I have enjoyed other movies that were not aimed at my age group like the first Spiderman movie which was released around the same time.

What I dislike about the first movie is the stupid dialogue. Yeah, yeah. I know it has something to say about loyalty and whatever but mostly sounds like it was written by a 13-year old. Spiderman was goofy in places but there is a weird kind of tone throughout this, especially in the scenes between Vin Diesel and Paul Walker.

There is one particular scene that I didn't get for the life of me. Diesel's thuggish best friend accuses Walker of being a cop and the two of them is ready to kill Walker, but the scene ends without a payoff what so ever. It just cuts to the next scene. What the f...! The friend does inspire one of the funniest scenes in the whole thing. The friend is about to cause trouble because he is incensed that Walker has been accepted so easily by Torreto (Diesel's name in the flick). Diesel loses his temper and says something like: ""I didn't know you either and accepted you"". The friend then replies: ""We were 3, you idiot"". Priceless, even though it's not totally verbatim. I honestly can't remember if I reversed the dialogue, but it is still funny as hell.

One more scene I have to mention which is unintentionally hilarious. Walker blows his pistons in the first race. Diesel says something like: ""Oh, we better get that repaired"". The car is steaming and 2 seconds later Walker's car is fine to drive. What did they do? Just throw the pistons in the hood and they magically attached and worked perfectly. Granted, I am not a mechanic but I know a car that has lost its pistons need more work than that. Then there is a guy who says: Cops are coming! Walker and Diesel flees in separate cars and for a very flimsy reason, Diesel decides to park in a garage and just slowly stroll down the street (check out the directors commentary).l The cops spot him and Walker picks him up (of course in the magically reconstructed car).

I know I am not supposed to nitpick at plot points like this but they are so obvious here. The races are few and far between which is another problem and they are hard to follow. One thing you could see is the lever that activates the nitrous oxide conveniently labeled ""NOS"". Again, hilarious.

There are a lot of other problems with the movie but let's just say I was thoroughly underwhelmed. I knew I was not supposed to see a piece of high art but come on; some b-movies make ten times more sense than this. I was also shocked to find out that Roger Ebert actually liked this and gave it three stars. He attacked films that had much better dialogue and plot developments than this. Maybe his illness was getting to him at that point, but I don't think so.

I know my commentary is a little long and perhaps a bit unfair because there are some good elements in the show. A sensational car chase at the end and the best part, Paul Walker, as I am saddened by his death. He could have done so much more than these picture and if you saw one of his first roles in Pleasantville you saw real potential. He looked a lot like a young Paul Newman and could have followed his path which makes his death even sadder. I guess the money eased his pain, though.

Note: Do yourself a favor and listen to the director's commentary. Not only is it hilarious but makes you understand the film a whole lot better. I changed my opinion from this being a terrible movie to a terrible movie with some good elements, if that has any relevance to anyone at all.",policy134,2015-07-04,2015
2.0,It Made Me Furious Very Fast.,"The Fast and the Furious (2001): Dir: Rob Cohen / Cast: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Michelle Rodriguez, Rick Yune: Stupid action farce that made me furious very fast. Paul Walker plays an undercover cop out to expose illegal drag races. They hijack trucks by surrounding their target and harpooning their way inside. Police fear that the truckers will arm themselves. Walker is unwelcome at a hangout since the waitress shows him more respect. She is sister to star racer Vin Diesel who seems unfazed at the violent commotion. Walker wins Diesel's trust in a crucial moment. Disturbing film where law can be broken pending on who you know on the police force. Director Rob Cohen keeps the action at fast pace. This is a much different film from his previous, which includes Dragonheart and Daylight. Diesel is the so-called hero who will win over the mostly young male audience and get rewarded for his reckless lifestyle. Walker is total cardboard who will eventually be found out yet be the good guy to the bad guys. Jordana Brewster as Diesel's sister is there to sleep with Walker. Michelle Rodriguez also makes a wasted appearance. Smokey and the Bandit is much more entertaining and contains just as much nonsense. The difference is that the characters are more interesting. Film falters when it positions criminals as heroes and poisons young minds with its garbage. Score: 2 / 10",anaconda-40658,2015-07-09,2015
10.0,"""The Fast and the Furious"" is One Hell of a Thrill Ride!","I've seen a compilation of the 1st-6th movies of the ""The Fast and the Furious"" film franchise and seeing ""Furious 7"" trailer on Youtube, and I think they're very great movies. Instead of seeing ""Furious 7"" on April, I decided to watch the earlier films and just catch up to the seventh movie. I'm kinda surprised that these movies began in 2001 until 2015 and counting, so this series is 14 years old. Buying the 6 DVDs is money very well spent! The awesomeness begins here!Brian (Paul Walker) is an undercover cop who should investigate the illegal street racing, where Dominic (Vin Diesel) is a key person. Brian then establishes relationships among the people, especially to Dominic's sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster), and now finds himself in a middle of a crossroad. Will he perform his duty or will he choose the people who consider him a family?I love the car races. Nice editing, good special effects (for Hollywood 2001), and fantastic soundtrack! I simply adore how this movie moves at lightning speed, thus living up to its title. The scenes will pump up your heart! Hell, yeah! The ending is obviously a cliffhanger, so expect a sequel. And if you're the type of person who stops watching during end credits, watch the credits and listen to the soundtrack.

7.0,The start of Universal's biggest franchise to date.,"A slick, adrenaline-fuelled action flick featuring a hot cast, a cool soundtrack, and countless custom cars, The Fast and the Furious is designed primarily to appeal to the young petrol-head crowdâ€”those who would spend a fortune on a sound system for their ride and then blast crap music out of the windows while sat in a McDonald's car park (at least here in the UK). Anyone heavily into car culture will probably wet themselves in excitement over the modified machines on display.But even if the idea of highly-polished Japanese street cars with more expensive accessories than a Kardashian doesn't get your pistons pumping, there's always the human eye-candy: for the ladies, there's blonde-haired, blue-eyed Paul Walker and bald bit of rough Vin Diesel, while the guys get numerous tasty young women to ogle, including Jordana Brewster as Vin Diesel's younger sister and Michelle Rodriguez as feisty girl-racer Letty. We also get lots of impressive stunts to keep the pulse pounding, with a great chase scene featuring one character dangling from a truck cab while being shot at by the driver, and a white-knuckle jump across railway tracks in front of an oncoming train that results in a spectacular crash.",BA_Harrison,2015-07-25,2015
9.0,Still the best of the bunch!,"So I finally got around to seeing the 7th movie in the immensely successful Fast & Furious franchise. I am a big fan of the entire franchise, and even though the latest part (Furious 7) currently gets the highest ratings out of all, the 1st is still my favorite. It has a certain charm that all the sequels lack. As a movie on it's own, much has been said before: The story is rather shallow, it has plot holes-a-plenty and the dialogue makes you cringe, but if you like fast cars and action, you'll most likely enjoy this movie. Nothing new there. But I would like to point out why for me the original The Fast & The Furious is still the highlight of the franchise.

First of all, next to being a movie buff, I'm also very much a car guy, and from that point of view I can appreciate The Fast & The Furious' efforts to try and portray genuine car culture. An aspect that for me has really been missing from the later additions in the franchise. Admittedly for the car-tuning community this movie probably did more bad than good, and car enthusiasts love to rip on all the technical mistakes in this movie, but compared to the later F&F movies, this one actually does quite alright. For example, when Dom (Vin Diesel) shifts his car (a Mazda RX7) into gear at the start of the first race we get to see an elaborate CGI sequence that takes us through the entire drive train of the car. It's a fancy gimmick at first, but re-watching this sequence some time ago I noticed that the engine of the car didn't have pistons. Instead it has rotors. The filmmakers actually took the time to research the fact that RX7's are powered by rotary engines rather than your standard piston engine. We don't see this kind of attention to detail in the later movies and for all it's technical mistakes the 1st Fast & Furious also gets it right in many places.

But even apart from these technicalities, The Fast & The Furious has got more redeeming qualities. I find that the original Fast & Furious has the most believable characters compared to the other installments in the franchise. Here we have a group of high-school drop-outs, who grew up together doing their car-thing. They're clearly a close-knit group of friends (a family) kept together by Vin Diesel's leader/father figure. In this context Diesel's character and the entire ""I got family"" thing makes sense. This isn't so much the case in the later movies (especially 5, 6 and 7), where Dominic becomes this stuck-in-the-past guy going on and on about his so called ""family"" who are actually just a group of loosely associated characters that come together on occasion and then go their separate ways again. Don't get me wrong, the all-star ensemble is fun in the action-blockbuster franchise F&F has become now, but below the surface the original still provides most of the drive behind the characters 6 movies later.

In a similar way The Fast & The Furious has the best ""bad guys"" from the series as well. I always found Johnny Tran and his gang much more intriguing than any of the other bad boys in the sequels. In every other F&F film the crew rises up against some mafia figure (Verone, Braga, Reyes, etc.) who is evil for the sake of being evil, and who's ultimate downfall is always underestimating this crew of street racers because, you know, they're just street racers, right? It gets rather formulaic. Johnny Tran on the other hand isn't this ultimate bad guy. In fact his actions are rather well motivated. He's not even looking for trouble, like he says: ""You stay away, I stay away. Everybody stays happy"". But then this Torreto guy shows up in his turf again, some guy steals his engines, his whole family gets raided by the police, and to top it off he wins a pink slip fair and square, but the guy drives off. So he's righteously angry and retaliates. Johnny Tran has a reason to be the bad guy, unlike those in later installments.

Further more the dialogue is actually one thing that I like about this movie. For better or worse, this movie has become one of the most quoted movies among my friends and family. Like many have pointed out before, the dialogue (especially the tech-talk) isn't the best written, but unintentionally this also adds to the believability of the characters. Go to any car meeting and you're bound to hear guys talking like they know all about cars and engines, while in fact they don't. Just like Dom's infamous victory speech. A lot about this movie is all show and no go, but that's also very much the ""tuning"" scene it tries to portray, in such a way that by now this movie often feels like a time-document, an homage almost, to the ridiculous car-mod culture in those days.

Lastly I think The Fast & The Furious deserves a an extra credit for the original score by Brian Transeau (BT). He perfectly captures the atmosphere of the film with his scoring, particularly taking influence from his groundbreaking debut album ""Ima"". The later films lack this quality especially whenever ""Ludacris"" is involved and the entire soundtrack is full of cheesy pop-rap/club music that really doesn't fit the style of the movies at all.

So there you have it, 8/10 for the original Fast & Furious film. Well deserved and still the best of the bunch!",SimonCornelis,2015-07-31,2015
7.4423076923076925,Slightly Dated But Still Enormously Fun.,"A surprise hit of its year whose unexpected success spawned a franchise that continues to churn out sequels even to this date, The Fast and the Furious is the sole reason why both Vin Diesel & Paul Walker are a household name today and even if it seems a bit dated now, it's still capable of delivering a cinematic ride that's thrilling & fun for the most part.The story of The Fast and the Furious is set in Los Angeles and follows an undercover cop who's assigned to find the gang responsible for stealing expensive electronic equipments, and uses his cover to infiltrate into this world of illegal street racing but soon begins having doubts about where his loyalties lie as he becomes increasingly enamoured by this lifestyle.A finely directed film, the dialogues of which may sound a bit corny now, one of the reasons why this street-racing thriller works is because of the testosterone high it provides with the high-speed racing & chase sequences it packs in, which wasn't an everyday phenomena in movies back in those days, in addition to the plethora of style it oozes from the first frame to the last.On an overall scale, The Fast and the Furious is an exciting blend of an interesting storyline, kinetic direction, energetic camera-work, fabulously edited chase sequences & top-gear score that's fun, enjoyable & entertaining for the most part, while the committed performances by Diesel & Walker do provide the boost it required to propel itself beyond mediocrity. Definitely worth a shot.",CinemaClown,2015-09-02,2015
8.0,Fast Paced action,"The one that started it all, The original Fast and the Furious is a movie that I think is often forgotten. Fans and casual viewers alike think of the extremely over the top impossible action sequences the newer Furious movies have become. But few remember that once upon a time, it was about street racing and boosting trucks.While it is essentially a Point Break remake with cars instead of surfers, the Fast and the Furious manages to stand on its own and be a thoroughly entertaining movie. The dialogue is pretty stupid at times and some stuff that happens doesn't always make sense, but the movie never fails to entertain.The Fast and the Furious is probably too good to be considered a guilty pleasure, but too bad to be considered a great movie, so I'll just say, even if it's stupid at times, and over the top, The Fast and The Furious is without a doubt a very entertaining movie I really enjoy watching every once in a while.",schroeder-gustavo,2015-09-21,2015
6.0,Good start to a great action-packed film franchise,"I love FAST AND FURIOUS movies, so I thought, ""What if I reviewed these movies?"", so I will review each film from the original film to the new film.So, I begin my second franchise review with the original 2001 film, The Fast and the Furious.The Fast and the Furious was not only released on June 22, 2001 to financial success and mixed reviews, but it also launched the careers of nearly all of it's stars, including Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, who would later become household names, as well as Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez.The film is directed by Rob Cohen with a screenplay by David Ayer, who wrote the 2001 film Training Day and co-wrote this film with two other writers including the creator of the franchise, Gary Scott Thompson.The film follows undercover cop Brian O'Conner who must stop semi-truck hijackers led by criminal and wanted fugitive Dominic Toretto from stealing expensive electronic equipment while developing a relationship with Dominic's sister, Mia Toretto and forming a friendship with Dominic.That is just a quick summary. I won't go into too much of the plot, because a lot of people should know what is the main premise of the story in this film and the other Fast and Furious movies. The franchise would later go to move away from the underground street racing plot into a plot much more cooler with the heist of $100 million dollars, gun fights and brawls and the movie that would change this franchise and bring new life into it would be the fifth entry in the series, released in April of 2011, Fast Five.The story is just really cool and amazing, but is not Oscar worthy, but the dialogue is the movie can get a little weak on a few occasions, but not throughout the whole darn movie.The action is just top-notch and the car chases in this film is as intense and action-packed as they would be later on in the franchise. My favorite car chase is at the beginning of the film and at the end of the film involving Dominic and Brian driving.The acting is just dreadful, but not all of it is. I will give credit to Vin Diesel, who plays Dominic Toretto and he pulls it off wonderfully, but while it's not Oscar worthy, he does show emotion, drama and laughter into his character. Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz, is great in this film and she would remain in that part for the other films and she would play in James Cameron's groundbreaking special-effects extravaganza Avatar and in the 2002 action-horror / zombie movie film based on the survival video game, Resident Evil.The other two that also does a great job is definitely Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster, who plays Brian O'Conner and Mia Toretto, and they do a very decent good job with the material written for them and they have such a great chemistry on the screen.Dominic Toretto's team members are just good. The actors who play the people in his crew is just incredible, with the exception of Matt Schulze as Vince.The music and soundtrack is really cool and Ja Rule is in this film, playing the role of Edwin and he provides music on the soundtrack.Overall, The first and original FAST AND THE FURIOUS is really good, but can get a little confusing in a few areas. I give it a 6 out of 10. It's not the best score, but certainly not the worst. This film is worth the watch and worth buying on DVD and Blu-Ray or watching on basic cable and Video on Demand or Xfinity Streampix.",joshuadrake-91275,2015-09-23,2015
6.0,Horses are beautiful,"It's a stupid car chase movie. Sorry, I mean if you are into cars then you will love this movie, it's f*cking all about cars. Or if you are into one dimensional plot, this movie's plot is entirely one dimensional. Come on man, it's just a car movie, they make drugs they make rock 'n' roll music the world is full of beautiful people, you can't expect me to give a f*ck about cars anymore. Who cares? F*cking cars? I guess it's entertaining? I saw it in the theater? 2001 was a long time ago? Yes, this is my review of The Fast And The Furious, it's a rambling tumble of letters and words, I see that now, but I'm gonna muster on to say what needs to be said : I WOULD RATHER RIDE A HORSE.",jessegehrig,2015-10-02,2015
7.0,"Cars, speed, babes, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker","Some would love this movie, others wouldn't but you can deny The Fast and The Furious started a trend which is still on going today. Never Street Racing has been so popular since this movie came out.The street races are beautifully done and care had been applied to get the audience feeling the power and the adrenaline the pilots must feel behind the wheel of those road beasts full of NOS. There is no need to say that this is the signature of the entire series. Whatever the plot is, there is always a street race going on and each one of them is masterfully shot and scripted. This series is first of all a tribute to the cars and the driving skills of their pilots.The other asset of this movie are Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. The first one is playing Dominic Torretto, all in muscle respected and regarded as the leader of the entire LA racing community. Like her sister Mia says, everyone is attracted and orbits around Dom. Paul Walker is Brian O'Conner a promising undercover cop tasked to bring down Torretto and his team. He is definitely cute, bold and has racing in his blood. This duo are bearing the movie on their shoulders. When one is missing it has not the same impact.",AmyJenson1995,2015-10-04,2015
10.0,A solid entertainment weel done action heist movie,"The Fast and the Furious (2001) It is solid decent action film of the film franchise. I love this film it is my third favorite film in the series. I wasn't watching this film for the cars or street races this film is about robbery, as a string of high-speed electronics truck robberies rocks the area. The Team stole $1.2 million worth of major electronics and the cops doesn't have any leads who has done it. There is only one team that could be responsible, Dominic Torreto (Vin Diesel) and his gang of street racers. During the night Torreto and his crew of street racers are driving cars in Los Angeles. Brian O'Conner (Paul walker) a undercover LAPD officer under the alias ""Brian Earl Spilner"", is he assigned to find out who is stealing the merchandise. This is my favorite film, it is an decent Action film about heist $1.2 million and not about the cars. Why I love this film? Because It is clever, intelligent, Entertained, fast paced and not boring film. The girls are beautiful in this team. The Action sequences are real and perfectly done. I love that late Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner and undercover L.A. Police Officer who try's to do the right thing. I am Paul Walker fan and Brian O'Conner is my favorite character of the whole franchise and series. I am saying The Fast and the Furious is better than 2,3 and even 7 so the film is pretty good.Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster did a terrific job playing their characters.With these players set in motion, it's up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. (One often sees great performances in mediocre films..here the story transcends the performances -- an impressive feat.) The script delivers. These themes are reinforced by the fine performances by Paul Walker and, particularly, Vin Diesel. Diesel's Toretto is a tough, no-nonsense, street-smart and highly-skilled racer on the outside, but as O'Conner and the audience come to know him, it is revealed that he is a human being with feelings, a troubled and hard past, and doing his best to get along, even if it means skirting or breaking the law. He's the head of a household, and the patriarch of sorts of a gang that is more family than it is a collection of members. Diesel brings hard-nosed and gritty energy to the role, but compliments that with a softer, more accessible side that makes him an odd sort of antihero, a man clearly in the wrong but not maliciously or spitefully so. Walker, too, is excellent as the undercover officer that finds the world of underground racing not-so-seedy as it seems. On the turbo-charged streets of Los Angeles, every night is a championship race. With intense full-throttle action, awesome high-speed stunts, and full-on pedal to the metal intensity, this fast and furious assault puts you in the driver's seat and dares you to exceed all limits.Los Angeles police officer Brian O'Connor must decide where his loyalties really lie when he becomes enamored with the street racing world he has been sent undercover to destroy.It don't matter if you win by an inch or a mile. Winning's winning. The Fast and the Furious is a gritty and gratifying cheap thrill, Rob Cohen's high-octane hot-car is a true rarity these days, a really good exploitation, the sort of thing that would rule at drive-ins if they still existed. The Fast and the Furious is a good Action movie. It offers a conventional plot but populates the story with well-developed primary characters that draw the audience in and make them care about their stories. In the movie, the line between good and bad becomes blurred to the point that, by the end, it matters not which side of the law the characters call home.I love this film to death! It is my 3d favorite film in the series franchise. The Fast and the Furious kicks ass! Even for PG-13 film they kick ass! Brian O'Conner kicks ass!!!",ivo-cobra8,2015-10-17,2015
9.0,Nostalgia,"This movie was my favorite movie growing up as a kid. Ever since i was little i loved watching this move. This move is a good film to watch if you are into the car scene as much as i am and also if you like the action genre. Paul walker did an amazing job on this movie, this movie is the reason i first got introduced into him. I soon became a fan of his. The scenes are pretty well done although at some parts you cab tell the voice audio was added in after wards. The music was good and always fit the scenes perfectly. This movie in my opinion was the best one in the entire series. The 7th one has a pretty good place in my heart too seeing it was the last film Paul walker worked on before his passing.all i can say is that this movie has aged well and is one of if not my favorite movie of all time",giovannys-78044,2015-10-28,2015
7.0,Fun if fairly mindless action flick,"Brian O'Connor is a Los Angeles police officer who is working undercover to discover the identity of a group involved in a series of truck hijackings. To this end he tries to get in with the street racing community. To do this he will not only need to take part in the races he will have to impress the other racers. His bosses are convinced that one Dominic Toretto is behind the crimes but as Brian gets to know him he becomes less sure and is soon convinced that a group of Chinese racers are the ones involved is this really the case or of Brian becoming a bit too friendly with Toretto? He has also fallen for Toretto's beautiful sister which leads to some friction with another one of the group who also has the hots for her.

If you are looking for the 'Citizen Kane' of action movies this isn't it; however if you just want some good mindless fun with fast cars and a good looking cast you could do much worse. Early on I thought this would just be 'Point Break' with street racers instead of surfers in many ways it is but there are as many differences as similarities. As one might expect there are a succession of action set pieces; this include several races, fights, shootings and a spectacular truck robbery that goes horribly wrong. These are pretty exciting even if they are a bit unrealistic at times an example of this is the truck hijacking; it takes place on what appears to be a main road but we don't see a single other vehicle for the entire scene if you can ignore this sort of thing this shouldn't detract from the film. The cast might not be Oscar contenders but the do a solid job. Overall this is a solid enough brain-in-neutral action film.",Tweekums,2015-11-12,2015
7.0,"Point Break, the remake or an homage","Paul Walker playing Keanu Reeves, even down to his voice and choice of sandwich (albeit different bread); Point Break is one of my favourite films, and I really enjoy Fast and Furious but it is more or less a play by play copy of the surf-ace movie ten years on. Vin Diesel is the Bodhi-esque sensei-master surrounded by his acolytes and is convincing; it's one of his best roles (along with Pitch Black 1). He's a powerhouse. The film is attractive, stylish with a hot soundtrack and showcases the street-racer subculture in Los Angeles.Paul Walker isn't just an ersatz Reeves, he is glorious in his own right; beautiful, sexy, tough, controlled and engaging and his chemistry with Jordana Brewster (Dom Toretto's little sister) was nice, but is overshadowed by the bromance between Dom and Brian. Michelle Rodriquez is a great female foil for Diesel; she's gorgeous and convincing as a high-octane junky.Hey, F&F is never going to win awards for the most intelligent film in existence but it's pretty, amusing in places, a little cheesy and poorly dubbed but good cinema and must have had something to spawn itself into one of the largest grossing film franchises of all time. It plays like a music video, with touches of CSI in the filming but much of it is a little pointless and OTT. Vin Diesel is perfect as Dom and his chemistry with all the characters is sparkling. He plays the showman well. Paul Walker is gorgeous, he really is a loss to the acting world, and this film is his magnum opus. Walker and Diesel were obviously buddies and as such it makes this film all the more special. It's great cinema but is definitely flawed, especially in the realm of script. Don't take it too seriously, strap on your petrol-head and enjoy.",HelenMary,2015-11-28,2015
8.0,A fine example of cinematic adrenaline and incredulity,"The Fast and the Furious is, at the very least, an intriguing franchise, for it gives gearheads the kind of inspiration and fantasy they need to have to keep sane. I've always found car hobbyists to face quite the paradox; the problem with cars is that they are grossly expensive, so if you're a middle class man, having two is quite the luxury. However, if you're deep into cars as a fascination, you presumably not only want one or two cars, you want several, and you want them customized and rigged to your liking. Customizing and optimizing the performance on one car is grossly expensive, but having a garage of half a dozen or more customized/optimized vehicles could cost as much as your house and your neighbor's houses put together. This is why, each and every day, I'm more and more satisfied with my lack of interest in cars and my own obsession with the Honda Accord I drive.The Fast and the Furious also gives gearheads that kind of adrenaline rush and visualization of their dreams realized because they, themselves, often don't have the means, the vehicles, nor the kind of closed-range courses to carry out the kind of eye-popping stunts and mayhem the characters in these films cause. It caters to that level of unbridled excitement, when you're actually racing in a vehicle and that moment where you get that indescribable pang in your chest reminding you know that you're alive. I was fully ready to embrace this franchise for its fantastical elements, but unsure if I could still be entertained watching car chases and death-defying stunts for an upwards of two hours.What's pleasant about The Fast and the Furious is that it focuses on the relationships the characters have with one another in the midst of all the racing. The film's slender plot revolves around Brian O'Connors (Paul Walker), an undercover Los Angeles police officer sent to infiltrate a ring of truck hijackers and street racers in the heart of L.A.. Led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), a suave know-it-all when it comes to vehicles, the gang is known for their heavily armed carjacking activities of large eighteen wheelers, in addition to their work at auto-body shops where they modify and customize cars, some of which flirting with and others unabashedly breaking the laws of what is street legal. Also working in Dom's crew are Leticia Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez), his longtime girlfriend and mechanic at his shop, in addition to his sister Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster), whom becomes the apple of Brian's eye late in the film.Brian's infiltration of Dom's ring soon becomes corrupted by his fascination with the culture Dom and his crew have created; it's a culture that specializes in prompting and maintaining a longterm adrenaline rush in the most unique and heart-pounding ways. Despite Brian's responsibility to uphold the law through all this, he finds his involvement with Dom going above and beyond the call of the law, as far as hooking up with Dom's sister and helping Dom plot a crackdown of former partners that have turned into rival gangmembers following a reneged agreement.No matter which way you slice it, The Fast and the Furious is slight in substance, but often very strong on a level of entertainment. At only one-hundred minutes, it pleasantly skates by without being too much of an assault on the senses and operates largely on the charm and infectious personalities of its actors. Walker is the standout of the crowd, maintaining a certain level of cool and street-smarts and his character never hitting the level of cocksure confidence, making him a more watchable and likable presence. That's not to undermine Diesel's role here, because without him, this film wouldn't be as much of a bromance as it already is. From the first race, it is clear that Walker and Diesel have enough chemistry to create a bond between two opposite characters in terms of life paths in order to go on many more adventures with one another. The supporting cast of Rodriguez and Brewster are fine, though even in more masculine roles, the two feel like nothing more than decorative pieces of eye-candy that help further the plot along when convenient.But perhaps such was just destined to be the case in The Fast and the Furious, a film where escapist tendencies take over and nothing else matters besides the moment when your car begins to redline or a part becomes misplaced in Dom's garage of odds and ends. Being that this film largely predicates itself on male bonding and the thrill of racing from both an illegal and adrenaline-charged angle, The Fast and the Furious largely possesses a homey quality that makes it believable and grounded in reality, despite a certain conclusion with a certain train that, I confess, was still entertaining in the realm of cinematic incredulity. This is a fun and effective film in being every gearhead's fantasy and being a damn fine piece of entertainment.Starring: Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, and Jordana Brewster. Directed by: Rob Cohen.",StevePulaski,2015-12-08,2015
9.0,Classic Fast,"""Classic of the series. I always enjoy throwing back and watching the dynamics of how the characters became."" Paul plays the undercover part perfectly. Vin is the ultimate bad boy but also the head of the family. Terrific cars scenes and camera angles capturing each rev and turn to its fullest degree. I have to say the beginning of one of the most favorite movie series ever. Timing is everything and the chase and race scenes are packed with so much action it will leave you on the edge. A thrill ride like no other probably the movie that stunned a lot of people with it's plot and smooth rides. If you ever see a movie 2x or more it is most likely this one.",EliAries,2016-02-08,2016
10.0,The First Film In the Series & Best One Afterall It is The Film That Started It All,"yes you read it right this is the very first film in the fast and furious series i have seen all of them even the new one furious 7 i am waiting for fast 8 but out of all i love this one.

why i love this film is not just because i am a hardcore Vin diesel fan but because of the direction in this one by Rob Cohen this director is gold after this he made one more movie with Vin Diesel called Triple X aka xXx in year 2002 both of these films are proof that this guy is a master action director he is my favorite action film director along with John Woo.

i don't have to tell about all the cast you know who they are but i will mention Paul walker here it is sad that he passed away few years back but his style in this film is epic,also i got into fish sandwiches & burgers because of him seriously there is one funny scene in this film that is one of my favorite nothing beats its at the start of the film when Brian come at Dom's eating place but things go wrong as he gets into the fight with Vince,the whole situation is pure hilarious with the background song called watch your back.

the plot:the story of this film is very simple its about a undercover police officer Brian O Connor who infiltrates Dominic Torretoes gang because the gang is involved in stealing trucks full of expensive electronics.

this film got it all right the cars the street racing & even the music,the action is slow at times but good to enjoy,this is the best one in the entire series the rest of the sequels are nowhere near to this.

Rob Cohen needs a good film to direct now he is in deep mess these days.

here what most i like about this film is the character of Paul walker he appears weak but watch the climax & you'll see what he does he is fearless he saves the entire team of Dom from the truck driver,he overshadowed Vin diesel here a little by his performance,don't know if he did all those stunts by himself but it was cool to watch him in action.

some people hate this film & the entire fast & the furious series for no reason i say don't listen to them or critics go buy or rent all of these film there are seven of them,if you like James bond series or Mission impossible ones or even Jason Bourne ones & if you are a action junkie like me then please pick this up without a doubt it is very entertaining & worth your time.

this came out in 2001 but looks fresh the picture quality is amazing too.just don't go and watch the latest ones because of the hype around them you must see this one then the rest,i know people are going crazy over furious 7 but it nice but not good as this one.

Overall this film is a mix bag of comedy,romance,action & drama so my rating for The Fast & The Furious 2001 is 10/10:Recommended",FilmMan47,2016-02-10,2016
9.0,Great Movie,"I love the fast and the furious. I love the relationship that Dom and Brian have in the movie. The action sequences are amazing and I just love the whole racing world that they have in the film. I love the character of Dominic, I love how loyal he is to his family and friends. I also love the character Brian, and how he is loyal to Dominic despite everything. Letty is also a great character in the film and I love just how badass she is. She is a take no nonsense badass chick and I think that is just great. This is a great movie overall that is made to be an entertaining action movie. The plot is pretty good overall but what I think is the best part are the action sequences. They really made the action sequences in the film great and they gave them that wow factor.",ninaalverz,2016-02-27,2016
1.0,This has got to be the worst franchise of all movie franchises,"This has got to be the most awful and stupid movie franchise of any movie franchise imaginable on EARTH. This movie is so stupid, you get better material out of ""Moving"" (with Richard Pryor) than this trash. Well for one, culturally they get the Spanish people wrong. They make it seem that Visigoths (basically a Germanic tribe that conquered Spain, giving us last names like Ortiz and Gonzalez) are not white. Second of all this movie stupidly assumes that Visigoths are the only people in the Spanish word who use the word ""bro"" and ""sis."" Even WORSE, that Visigoth women are the only broish women on earth. When that honor goes to Italians and Spanish (non-Visigoths), Delgados and Riveras. They're the ones who say ""bro"" and chill with guys and wear Jordans, not Sanchezes. Yes I say this because of Letty Ortiz. This movie is the dumbest stupidest movie on the face of the earth. If you want something more realistic watch ""Moving"" with Richard Pryor. This movie is stupid. PURE STUPID!",robert-macc,2016-04-03,2016
2.0,Shoddy remake of the 1955 classic,"Never watched any of these before so I thought I'd give it the old college try.Oh dear. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. This cinematic abortion looks like it was made in the mid-90s with a mid-80s cast, a mid-70s plot, and a mid- 60s colour palette. Unmitigated cretinosity. Contains many memorable lines, including:'This doesn't feel right.' 'Aaaaaah, my arm!' 'Yeah, it's funny how that works out.' 'I like the tuna here.' 'Let's go for a little ride.''He went to the car wash.'Move over Shakespeare, the pros have arrived! I rate The Fast and the Furious at 6.66 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a predictably dull 2/10 on IMDb.",Sankari_Suomi,2016-06-10,2016
5.0,Good race scenes lift a fast-paced thriller,"Here's a throwaway popcorn flick that manages to be engaging thanks to the central storyline, that old chestnut of the detective going undercover and becoming friends with the man he's supposed to be sending to jail. The old, old plot is given a new spin with a fresh cast and an interesting backdrop â€“ illegal street racing. Given the MTV expectations, the film is as flashy as you would expect thanks to director Rob Cohen, packed with pumped up loud music to drive to and enough testosterone to fill three football fields. Still, have no misconceptions: this is a high-octane thrill-ride and professes to be nothing more and nothing less.The film certainly satisfies on the action front, with some madly exciting car chases and stunts, although there is a definite lull in the action around midway which is a bit surprising. Thankfully things finish off with an expertly done, extended set-piece involving a truck and an amazing car crash to finish things off (ludicrously spoilt in the trailer). Even cooler, the DVD allows you to rewatch the stunt from EIGHT different camera angles, a feature which has made the format for me.The characterisation is a bit thin on the ground but the two leads are strong: Paul Walker does nothing wrong as the young undercover cop, and Vin Diesel manages to be effortlessly cool and a natural born leader again after PITCH BLACK. The supporting cast is ho-hum, but it is interesting to see DIE ANOTHER DAY's Rick Yune without all that makeup on. Not a perfect movie, but fast-paced and interesting enough to be worth a look.",Leofwine_draca,2016-07-11,2016
6.0,Somehow Created a Series,"Los Angeles police officer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) must decide where his loyalty really lies when he becomes enamored with the street racing world he has been sent undercover to destroy.As of now (2016), I cannot even keep track of how many films there are in this series. At least eight, maybe nine, and that's not counting the original version which has almost nothing to do with this one. How this movie spawned a whole industry is beyond me.Not that it is a bad movie, but it really has no depth at all. A guy races cars, and everyone else races cars, and the guy is attracted to another guy's sister. It all falls into place so easily, no hassle, no time to find out who anyone is. And yet, this is the movie that made Paul Walker immortal.",gavin6942,2016-08-23,2016
2.0,Not a complete waste of time,"""The Fast and the Furious"" is not a good movie, but I must admit, I watched it all the way through.On the plus side, many of the actors and actresses are relatively attractive; Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez are entertaining; some of the action sequences are somewhat entertaining; and the Dodge Charger is cool.On the negative side, the plot is silly at best. Brian lacks any credibility as a law enforcement officer, as do his silly ""superiors,"" and his motivations for anything other than spending time with Mia are a mystery. Dom's motivations are a mystery as well. I suppose the audience is supposed to believe that although he's something of a master criminal and has invested himself in a life of crime, he's OK with lying, and deceit, and police infiltration...Also, the characters lack development. Characterizing them as multi- dimensional would be generous; many cardboard cutouts are more interesting. Lastly, the dialog is entirely lacking in authenticity.I suppose some might think the cars are cool, although I don't know who those folks might be-- perhaps those that dream of nitrous oxide injection systems, and of spending tens of thousands of dollars on cars that sound like angry gnats...If you're looking to fill a couple of hours of your life with a mindless, nonsensical, semi-coherent action movie, this may be the perfect choice. Otherwise, you could most likely find something more worthwhile to do with your time. ""The Fast and the Furious"" is not recommended.",wpkolkho,2016-09-10,2016
7.0,Better than I remember,"I watched this last night. Haven't watched since it first came out. This was pretty good, I see why I got hooked to the franchise. I see now that Old Blue Eyes was the one top dog. i had forgotten about so many parts to the movie. I watched 2 last night was well. I'm going to review it next. I'm typing this while watching Tokyo Drift..... Oh yea the original crew was dope To bad Ja Rule opted out of part 2. I forgot about the villain in part 1 too I call him Remy. I love him from other movies .... Oh and YES that introduction to Sung Kang aka Hanz . I fell in love with him and been low key stalking him since. He's so cute. I must admit this is one of the better franchises around outside of ... OK let me get to another movie.",hersheedontplay,2016-11-25,2016
3.0,Pretty Substandard and full of clichÃ©s,"At first this movie came across as being really really boring and completely unoriginal. However, after watching it for a little more it because a little better, but it was still incredibly unoriginal and in the end just an excuse for illegal car races and some good old action scenes, which actually weren't all that fantastic either. Okay, sure, there were some stunts, such as jumping from a car onto a truck and back again, but that doesn't mean that the film was any good. Well, the fact that it has since spawned six sequels indicates that there is money to be made out of the franchise, but then again that isn't all that surprising because it does involve racing cars and a bit of typical action thrown in for good measure.

So, the film is basically about illegal drag racing in Los Angeles with a plot thrown in. The plot involves trucks being hijacked by a bunch of people in cars and the contents of the trucks being stolen. So, surprise surprise, a cop is sent to go undercover into the world of drag racing to find out what is actually going on, and to make an arrest. However, surprise surprise, he ends up getting a but too caught up in the scene, and the people that he is working with, and eventually has to make a call – his career or his friends.

This is pretty typical of your American cop movie, raising the concept that being an undercover cop isn't actually all that easy. Mind you, this is pretty glamourised as well, especially with them operating out of a rather flash house that they have confiscated. Okay, I'm not really sure how undercover cops actually work, though apparently they do go in pretty deep, and will even do things that are effectively illegal. Whether they actually get too emotionally involved, or even end up going off with the bad guys is another story all together.

As for the film, well, it is what I would call your typical 'guy' film, and more so a typical 'young guy' film – you have fast, and hotted up cars, lots of girls that are scantily clad, which is pretty typical of this type of movie, and Hollywood in general. Personally it really isn't a scene that I am all that into, and I am not sure why I am all that keen on actually watching any more of them, however I do have this desire to do just that so I guess I will see how this series pans out. Oh, and the car races are pretty ordinary as well.",The-Sarkologist,2016-12-02,2016
6.0,Fast-Paced Action and Drama,"Set in Los Angeles, this movie focuses on a team of thieves who hijack trucks operating a high speeds from optimally powered race cars. The cargo is then taken and sold on the black market. Needless to say, the FBI and local authorities are anxious to capture and prosecute these criminals before the truckers take matters into their own hands. To help them on this case a young police officer by the name of ""Brian O'Conner"" (Paul Walker) volunteers to go undercover and infiltrate the most high-profile illegal street racing team in the area which is led by a man named ""Dominic Toretto"" (Vin Diesel) who also has a prison record for violence due to his explosive temper. However, in order to investigate this case Brian first has to get inside this close-knit team and that is more difficult than anybody realizes. Additionally, this particular team is but one of many and it might not be the one responsible. But one thing is sure-action needs to be taken soon before violence erupts on the highways. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film has enough fast-paced action and drama to satisfy most fans of the genre. No doubt about it. On a more critical note though, I thought that some of the characters-most notably ""Letty"" (Michelle Rodriguez), ""Vince"" (Matt Schulze) and ""Hector"" (Noel Gugliemi)--were much too pretentious and almost to the point of being downright annoying. Likewise, some of the previously mentioned action scenes were more than a little unrealistic as well. But that's Hollywood for you. In any case, from what I understand this film has turned into a profitable enterprise for Universal Pictures and since nothing succeeds like success has bred numerous sequels in its wake. That said, despite the flaws just mentioned I enjoyed this movie and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",Uriah43,2017-01-02,2017
8.0,"Very good, but has its downs","As a car enthusiast i can say i loved this movie! Was fun to watch on my own time and didn't have to skip any boring dialogue like i always do.. Paul walker and Vin diesel make a very good combo in the first FnF but i personally think the acting in 2F2F was much better

Pros(Things i like)

.The movie has many race scenes unlike the new FnF movies .Includes a multitude of cars from Japanese tuners to American muscle, .acting was good, as i love paul walker for his acting .You are able to watch the movie without worrying about plot holes as the movie keeps you interested with its race scenes .Excellent choice of music More focus on cars then bank heists and not much of a focus on hot women, however there is the fair share of hotties in the movie .VERY GOOD character development between the MAIN CHARACTERS

Cons .WARNING, this movie was made by someone who knows nothing about cars, so any car enthusiast may cringe when they see something that happens to a car that is supposed to make a person who knows nothing about cars(which this movie is targeted to) say ""WOW! Cars can do that! So cool!"" .acting may be corny at times .movie ends too fast, leaving little plot holes and poor acting (EX: jesses death"" .Dont get exited about these cool modded cars with bodykits and spoiler, this concept is abandon in the 4th movie (2009) .Most of the side characters are abandon excluding Mia, letty, vince and hector...

Overall, really good, but has is mini downsides..",graverobbermineplex,2017-02-15,2017
4.0,Just a bonch of hype,This is not very good. The characters make chooses that do not make sense. The story line is awful. 2 fast 2 furious is a good movie. The fast and the furious Tokyo drift is also a good movie. Fast and the furious new model original parts is also a good movie. Fast five is also a good movie. Fast and the Furious 6 is also a good movie. Furious 7 is also a good movie. The best thing about this movie is if it had not been made the sequels would not have been made. 6.7 is overrating it. That is not a great film. I give 4. This is pretty bad. D.R no is a lot better. I like most action movies. I do not like this one. D.R no is great. From Russia with love is also a very good action movie. See that movie. Do not see this.,jacobjohntaylor1,2017-03-06,2017
6.0,One of the 'better' cool car style-focused action flicks of the turn of the century,"""The Fast and The Furious"" was the ""Point Break"" of the 2000s â€” a cop goes undercover to bust up a group of criminals who are into a specific ""sport,"" but he becomes attached to the very people he's trying to bust. ""Point Break"" is the better film, but ""The Fast and the Furious"" was the start of a multi-billion-dollar franchise. Go figure.Paul Walker plays the cop, Brian O'Conner, but the screenplay doesn't reveal this card until Brian has not only won the respect of top street racer Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), but also the viewer. This small betrayal of our trust is writer Gary Scott Thompson's shrewdest move as the film goes from somewhat interesting, albeit clichÃ©, to more interesting, albeit clichÃ©.The screenplay â€” co-written with Erik Bergquist and David Ayer (""Training Day"") based on the ""VIBE"" magazine article by Ken Li â€” is not the focal point of the movie, of course. This was 2001, the peak of the MTV Spring Break era. The point was to show hot foreign cars, hot foreign (and American) women and a lot of burning rubber. The rock, rap and techno music of the time feature prominently, and even rapper Ja Rule had a supporting role as a racer, a reminder of how the start of the 21st century was also the beginning of the music business starting to infiltrate the movie business.All this to say, director Rob Cohen understands this is a style over substance situation. Quarter-mile races, chases, fist fights and criminal heist activity are the featured attractions â€” as are the beautiful cars and beautiful people. If this film can be given any credit for originality, it belongs to the merging of heist/crime movie and drag race aesthetics. Cars had of course been featured in movies and television before, but this movie more authentically plays to the car aficionado, as a handful of films did in this era (e.g. ""Gone in 60 Seconds,"" ""The Italian Job""). There's a certain grittiness that this film has featuring real street-racing cars compared to James Bond, for example, driving something too cool to believe.The movie isn't 100 percent shallow from start to finish, however. A genuine effort is made to build chemistry between Walker and Diesel's characters. The story works best when it builds and tests that relationship. Nothing else about the movie feels worth our investment, but somehow we desperately do not want Brian and Dom to turn on each other despite all the reasons they should. Both Walker and Diesel bring likable dimensions to their characters and their chemistry is likely to be the bedrock of future films. (This coming from someone who has yet to see any of the other films yet.)The supporting cast, however, doesn't offer much. Dom's girlfriend, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), brings nothing to the story, and the other guys in Dom's gang aren't given the chance to be anything but meatheads. The romance between Brian and Dom's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) exists for formulaic reasons, but the fact that both of them feel kind of like outsiders to the street-racing culture gives their relationships some legitimacy.But enough about characters. ""The Fast and the Furious"" delivers some solid action sequences, especially the ones involving street cars and semi trucks. The racing scenes don't allow for much dimension, and the editing is decent to optimize suspense, but the CGI and green screen elements pull us out of what should feel like a very realistic, gritty street race. There are enough quality moments for action fans in ""The Fast and the Furious"" to overcome the MTV Spring Break music video world its characters inhabit. The 2000s were full of glossy movies with inferior story lines, and while comparing ""The Fast and the Furious"" to these films would obviously make it seem like a great movie when in fact it's an average one, it could be a suitable enough ambassador of its time and culture to movie watchers of the future.~Steven CThanks for reading!

7.0,A Guilty Pleasure Movie at its Finest,"16 years and 7 films ago the Fast & Furious franchise wasn't the worldwide phenomena that it is now. It was once a cheesy Point Break rip-off that took itself way too seriously. But you know what, it was a darn good guilty pleasure movie. That's for sure.A lot has changed over the years in the series, but the one constant has always been that the films are about family. For all its faults, no one can deny how well this film does the family angle. It's not the best acting, writing, or directing, but you care enough about the characters to where you believe the motivations behind characters' actions regarding family. But let's talk about how ridiculous, stupid, and fun this movie is.They drive their cars (successfully) underneath semi-trucks several times throughout the film. So much so that when I was younger I believed it was possible. That word, ""possible"", will be used sparingly through the course of this film and the entire series. Where Furious 7 pushes the boundaries of reality by driving cars via one building to the next, The Fast and the Furious provides the unbelievable through street car races with seemingly a few hundred people. In the middle of the night, that is. Oh and those hundreds of people each have their own car and parking spot, that is. But that won't be the last time the film could have you roll your eyes.In fact, it's way easier to watch this film now that I've seen every installment to date. This film is extremely dated, but it's an interesting watch, especially considering where the series has gone to now. There's an underground motorcycle gang who steals DVD players and stashes them in a Thai-food restaurant. The climax of the film begins at an event called Race Wars. Creative huh? At one point, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) tells someone to back off or she will scar her face with tire tracks. I guess my point is, if you don't accept the film for what it is, I don't think you'll have any fun with it.The real joy of this film comes by its goofiest and most outlandish moments, but also with its impressive stunts and action. In camera stunts may be this franchise's finest assets, and the last highway heist in this film is a thing of beauty. Yes, the film gets bogged down by a really dated and contrived script, but there's so much undeniable fun to be had here. A guilty pleasure movie at its best+Stunts/action+All about family+Ridiculously goofy/fun-Horrible script, and passable acting-Takes itself a little too serious at times7.5/10",ThomasDrufke,2017-04-04,2017
6.0,"""The Fast and the Furious""- While the sequels have gotten better and better, the original feels a bit dated and ""safe."" Fun, but not as entertaining as future installments.","The interesting thing about the long-running ""Fast and Furious"" franchise is that series fans seem to fall into one of two camps. Those who feel that the series started off decent but has gotten progressively better with each passing sequel. Especially as they take themselves less seriously and simply aim to entertain their audience more and more with increasingly insane and physics-defying action. And those who far prefer the earlier and slightly tamer installments for their slightly more grounded realism. And they tend to lament the fact that the later sequels have gone in an increasingly unrealistic and over- the-top direction. And as a result, I feel I must warn certain audience members... I'm most certainly in the former of those two groupings. Yes, I am somewhat sorry to say that to me, the franchise as a whole really didn't start picking up steam until about the third or fourth chapter. While by no means terrible, the earlier films haven't aged particularly well at all, and feel quite... docile and bland. Even the subject of this review- the original 2001 release from director Rob Cohen. It's a standard story and spends so much time on a plot ripped straight from ""Point Break"" (only substituting cars instead of surf-boards), that it doesn't really entertain to the same wild extent that later installments eventually reached.The film follows detective Brian O'Connor (the late Paul Walker), as he goes undercover to infiltrate the underground world of illegal street racing in Los Angeles. O'Connor and his superiors suspect that the same men and women who hold these illegal events are also responsible for a string of crimes throughout the city. He eventually forms a sort-of friendship with Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), one of the most famed of the underground racers. O'Connors conflicted feelings about whether or not to bust him are further complicated when he starts to fall for Dominic's younger sister Mia (Jordana Brewster), and eventually his investigation will lead to a complex and wild finale through the streets of LA.The highlights here are the wonderful and at-the-time relatively unknown cast and the high-octane action that crops up here and there. This is the film that really put Vin Diesel and the others on the map. Everyone gives it their all, and everyone comes across very likable and endlessly cool in the film. Especially Diesel and Walker, who both shot to stardom in the months following the film's release. I also really liked Michelle Rodriguez, who plays a supporting role as Letty, Domonic's girlfriend. She has that tough- yet-sexy appeal and works really well in the film. Brewster and fellow co-stars like Rick Yune and Chad Lindberg similarly do admirable jobs. On the whole, just a great, fun cast.Director Rob Cohen, fresh off of a string of 90's hits including ""Dragonheart"" and ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"", does a phenomenal job handling the action and adventure with his kinetic camera-work and unique use of color and saturation. Say what you will about the mixed quality of the films he's made- the man can make a thrilling sequence. You really feel the speed in the races and each crash hits you right in the gut. This is amongst his best work as a visual storyteller, and he delivers the action full-throttle. When the film goes into full- blown carnage, it works marvelously.Unfortunately, the film falters quite a bit thanks to the aforementioned stock-screen writing and for being a bit too dated when viewed in comparison to the rest of the series. For all intents and purposes, there's not a lot going on ""under the hood"" here. Every twist and turn is telegraphed from a mile away, characters fall into broad and undeveloped clichÃ©s (usually given a single ""quirk"" to define them, which is lazy screen writing 101), and you'll know how it ends pretty much immediately. It takes away a lot of the experience. The fact that the film is also basically a photocopy of the superior ""Point Break"" is also distracting at times and can occasionally lead to a lot of unintended giggles. In addition, this film feels very much a product of its time. This has ""Extreme 2001 movie!"" written all over it. From the music to the editing to even the slang used in conversation... the film is dated to the point it even occasionally feels a bit cringe- worthy.Still, I don't think it's a bad movie. Just a troubled one. And I do think it is still most certainly worth seeking out, especially as a prerequisite to viewing the entire series. It sets up a lot of characters and context that are expanded on in later films, and there's a lot of fun to be had with the great performances and top-notch action. For my money... It's one of the weaker ""Fast & Furious"" films. But it's still a ""Fast & Furious"" film through-and-through. And I say give it a shot.I give it an about-average 6 out of 10.",TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,2017-04-09,2017
7.0,"Still ""Fast"" after all these years","Rob Cohen's ""The Fast and the Furious"" has no business being as great as it is. A film about fast cars, undercover cops, and highway robbery should provide limited, perhaps dimwitted thrills, but Cohen's colorful and swift-paced action outing provides such likable characters, slick stunts, and buoyant spirit that the whole affair elevates itself to the highest levels of lively, well-assembled fun. It is a surprisingly robust and satisfying experience.The film follows an undercover police officer working to infiltrate the world of street racing to bust a low-level crime syndicate. While undercover, he develops an affinity toward the racers and inconvenient brotherhood is established. Between the cars, busts, and friendships, a token crime story becomes a tale of family. It is simply compelling and effortlessly entertaining.Cohen creates a multi-ethnic world of sunshine, turbo charged technology, and well-rendered characters. It is a Los Angeles of beautiful paint jobs, palm trees, and lived-in locations. Color, verve, and speed burst forth from Cohen's frames in layered and lively compositions. Editing, design, and music create an always- pulsing energy that permeates every sequence.Though the film is about racing and the thrills that drive the sport, Cohen cast actors that earn as much attention as the horse- powered rockets. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Chad Lindberg, and Michelle Rodriguez form the family unit the inspires the film's themes and emotions. Each actor builds a solid character, with the leads being especially memorable. Diesel glowers and Walker exudes a naive charm. They form a charismatic duo.A slick and undeniably entertaining action gem, ""The Fast and the Furious"" soars with its combination of character and thrills. Set pieces are exciting, character beats are affecting, and the stunts are electrifying. It is a remarkable, sweat, oil, and sun-soaked piece of work.",ryanskywalker-87402,2017-04-12,2017
8.0,"It is a neat, nitrous oxide powered glamour film","The surprisingly humble beginnings (by comparison) of what is now a six film series, The Fast and the Furious was a hit for bringing a new lease of life to the racing film.An undercover cop, Brian O'Conner, must discover who is to blame for goods trucks being hi-jacked and stolen by drivers in high performance street cars. He puts himself into the urban culture of street racing where he meets Dominic Toretto and his team. Brian falls for Dominic's sister, Mia, in the process and threatens his investigation and his life.The film is quite a brainless piece of entertainment, its story is predictable, it follows an undercover cop who starts to sympathize with his targets, and the characters are written spontaneously to fit the demands of the plot. You gotta love the opening dialogue: ""I like the tuna here,"" ""Nobody likes the tuna here!"" Plus, Paul Walker really is a bland actor.But, that isn't why we watch the film. The Fast and the Furious does have some great car racing scenes and director Rob Cohen can shoot the cars and make them look great. What is most appealing is the physicality of the stunts and the racing; there's no CGI tomfoolery here, and there is a simplicity about the film that makes it worth watching. You don't need to suspend your disbelief, the plot doesn't shovel many excuses for racing into your face.It is a neat, nitrous oxide powered glamour film. It doesn't say much, and it will probably age badly over time (and get a remake) but it is a must for every petrol-head and car racing fan out there.",CinemaCocoa,2017-04-13,2017
5.0,A decent action movie that sparks a huge series,"The movie that started it all follows a pretty generic plot and doesn't have the best action or acting, but is a passable film to build a franchise off of. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is an undercover cop trying to infiltrate a gang of street racers led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel). Brian flirts with Mia (Jordana Brewster), Dom's sister, and clashes with the gang of street racers, especially Vince (Matt Schulze). The rest of Dom's gang including Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Jesse (Chad Lindberg), and Leon (Johnny Strong) are more accepting of Brian's presence in the group. Brian loses a race to Dom but helps him elude the police to gain his trust.

Owing him a car, the two work to build a new car as Brian investigate a string of truck robberies. He suspects that the criminals are led by a rival racer Johnny Tran (Rick Yune). Sgt. Tanner (Ted Levine) and Agent Bilkins (Thom Barry) push Brian to look at Toretto as his bond with the team grows. They build a fast car that they plan to use in the upcoming street racing competition know as Race Wars.

7.0,"Entertaining Action Movie,But Not The Best","This is the one that started it all,is it more than just Point Break with cars?Let's find out.First,the good,the action,the race scenes are great,but there is also some good fist fights.The climax,it was intense and had some great stunts.The soundtrack,while it dates the film a bit,there's no denying it fits the tone perfectly.This may sound a bit stupid,but the editing was great,it had a fast pace that worked terrifically.I liked that there seemed to be little CGI involved,it seemed like there was a lot of practical stunts.The story,while it may not be the best it is well told.The best part,which sets this film apart from Point Break,is the characters,they feel real and are likable,even if most of them are criminals,the acting was good,even if some dialogue wasn't the best.Now,the bad,the pacing,while a movie like this doesn't need to be long,I feel like it went by a bit too fast.The ending,it was kind of dumb,but I did like how it completed Paul Walker's arc of the film.The villain,while he did have one good scene,he wasn't memorable at all.The script,due to the writing,the story's a bit hard to follow.Overall,The Fast and The Furious is a fun movie with great characters,but some bad scripting.",jordansepticeye,2017-04-17,2017
6.0,There's some enjoyment to be had but it's just alright; Would Recommend,"​Directed by Rob Cohen

​ Starring: Paul Walker, Vin Disel and Michele Rodriguez

Plot Overview: After many trucks have been raided by unknown race drivers, the FBI sends in undercover cop Brian O'Connor(Paul Walker) to infiltrate infamous driver, Dominic Torretto(Vin Disel)'s team and uncover who's behind all this.

# NO SPOILERS!

Overall: While this movie does include some enjoyable elements, I don't think it deserved a franchise to spawn from it. Most of the lead actors were pretty weak, the story was meh but it was pretty entertaining. It is also a very quotable movie with 'You can have any drink... as long as it's a Corona' being a quote that has become surprisingly popular. The movies main focal point(its races) were also pretty weak which is stupid considering that was what this franchise was founded on. In conclusion, it's enjoyable and I recommend it, but don't expect much.

The types of people who will like this movie will be people who enjoy car movies and movies including races.

Would Recommend.

# POSSIBLE SPOILERS!

Paul Walker was fine as Brian O'Connor and the supporting cast was reasonable. Vin Disel was very weak as Dominic Toretto and he's just not a very good actor. People say that he 'keeps this franchise together' but I argue it would be better without him. It's been proved he can't act and that's never been so obvious that these movies.

I liked the ending. The premise and overall story, however, were very stupid and didn't work.

I liked the cinematography for the most part but I feel like the actual RACE sequences were very poorly done and looked incredibly stupid.

The effect were pretty poor. The actual set and costume design was nice.

This movie was entertaining from start to finish and that is what it set out to do so I will assume it succeeded in that respect. It also introduces all the characters well and gives them reasonable roles in the story.

I will say that the dialogue in this movie is actually not terrible and 'You can have any drink... as long as its a Corona' is just a fun quotation. I will also say that the music didn't fit for the most part and felt out of place.

Personally, I enjoyed the movie all the way through but its not something I can see myself going back to constantly because I just don't see much point to it. It has its moments and some scenes were cool but it just doesn't provide enough to kick off a franchise nor does it deserve to be this popular among fans.

6/10",EthanBJones_03,2017-04-21,2017
4.0,How it all began,"""The Fast and the Furious"" is an American movie from 2001, so this one had its 15th anniversary already last year. It runs for 105 minutes roughly and the script was developed overall by no less than 4 writers, the most known one being David Ayer I guess. The director is Rob Cohen and this is probably still the most known effort from his career. He never returned to direct any other of this franchise's films. And now I said it already that this action movie we have here is the very first from the extremely long-running F&F franchise that is still very strong today. Eight films have been there so far and two more are already greenlit. The franchise seems unstoppable as even the death of number 1 lead actor (at least in this film we have here) Paul Walker did not put an end to the series. But we don't wanna talk about his tragic fate today, but instead focus on this film we have here. Tragic, or at least sad, is also a fitting description for the film I would say as I was not convinced by anything in here really apart from the effects perhaps. People often say that this is a movie for men, but if you take a look at the demographics here you will realize that women have actually given it an 0.3 higher rating, which of course also has to do with the quantity of voters. But still, saying this is a film for men is is pretty inaccurate in my opinion as it would imply that men have worse taste in film than women because honestly there is nothing impressive at all about the story here, the character writing and also the performances.

I believe that in terms of depth, the story could have fit in under one hour as well. The rest is mostly ""cool"" quotes that add nothing really, gimmicky behavior from the characters and then of course the pompous action scenes that turn this film into a definite case of style over substance. The core story of a cop infiltrating a gang of very fast drivers in order to get evidence on illegal activities is nothing that hasn't been done before and frequently better. If you read the actors' names, you also know that honestly you can't expect any powerhouse performances in here. It is all subordinated to the visual side and with the casting they absolutely made sure none of the cast members is going to take any attention away from that. The epilogue is probably even more embarrassing than the rest and honestly, having seen none of the many many sequels, I truly hope they managed to step things up and give audiences more than pointlessly spectacular car sequences and when they had enough of that, they switched to motorbikes and even helicopters. With films like this, there is of course always the opportunity for pointless fun, but this requires the film to not take itself as seriously as this one here did on several occasions. I give it a thumbs-down and like I said: If the following films don't show improvement, then I probably cannot be as generous as I was here with my 4/10 rating. Watch something else instead.",Horst_In_Translation,2017-06-04,2017
10.0,The first and the best,"The first movie of the successful saga is probably the best one. We are introduced to the main characters and to a world most of us had only heard of. You will laugh, you might cry, you may even want vengeance... You won't leave the theater or your living room without feeling some kind of emotion.I was fortunate enough to watch this in one of the best movie theaters in the country so I could enjoy the sound effects in all of their glory! However, as a petrolhead, I have to forget how many times they change gears (9 times? Really?!) to properly enjoy the movie about special cars and a large family (in the truest sense of how a family should be).The cars are also loud actors who are given to the right characters. The actors really studied and embraced their role to a point where we can feel their emotions and identify ourselves with some of them. There is a real chemistry between them and that is a very positive thing in this type of movies.10 out of ten to the best movie of one of the most successful sagas ever launched by Hollywood.

8.0,Excellent,"""The Fast and the Furious"" is not a great movie, but it delivers what it promises to deliver, and knows that a chase scene is supposed to be about something more than special effects.

5.0,Seriously?,"Yes, this has spoilers. Stop reading if you don't want to know what's up at the end.

This was such an odd movie because most of the main characters are bad guys. And not the kind who are just trying to steal bread to feed a starving family type of bad guys. Towards the end I'm rooting for the trucker to blow the heck out of most of the main characters. I'm rooting for Vin Diesel and his gang to die a bloody death for being ruthless thieves. Why on earth are they making movies with bad guys as the heroes?

Sure, there were incredibly cool racing scenes, done as only American movie studios can do. But seriously, what the heck? Why are we idolizing dirty rotten thieves who attack innocent people and steal from them? I know there are a plethora of sequels, so I knew these guys wouldn't meet the justice they deserve.

Now, after finally seeing the one that kicked it all off, I sorta get it. Neither as fast nor as furious as the title implies or as the later films (though the failed truck robbery is harrowing & character driven), it truly establishes the family vibe so often referenced later on, & the bro-y, sweaty chemistry is surprisingly strong.",matthewssilverhammer,2018-07-14,2018

9.0,One of my favorites films of all time,"The Fast and The Furious 
 After watching every single Fast and Furious movie in the series thus far, I can say for sure that the very first original Fast and Furious movie is still the best. The story goes from undercover cop trying to find illegal street racers robbing trucks of millions of dollars in electronics to the undercover cop growing close to the racers and trying to help them get away from the cops.
 This movie is very fast paced and an in your face thrill. The stunts they do with the cars are incredible and keep you very engaged and waiting for what's to come. All of the characters in the film are easy to relate to and makes you wonder which character you would be if you were in the film. The best duo is Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. In the beginning they are enemies hunting each other but by the end they are good friends helping each other out.
 Being a car guy myself, I have always loved car movies but this one just never goes away. I'm not sure if it's the action-packed scenes filled with police chases or the realistic street races that keep you on the edge of your seat. Although there are some insane car stunts in this film, the street races are very real and show how sometimes street racing goes good and sometimes it goes horribly wrong.
 The only thing about this film that I didn't like was some of the cars. Nearly all of the cars used were your typical European import cars. They could have branched out to some cars that many people don't see as often, and I would have been even more interested in the cars.
 There is truly something for everyone to enjoy in this movie even if you aren't a car person. There is thrills, action, love, hate, adrenaline, and a little bit of everything. I have watched this film with lots of different people and I have yet to hear any of them say they didn't like it because they can easily connect with one of the characters.
This movie got me hooked on horsepower at a very young age and still to this day whenever someone asks me what movie I want to watch, I always say The Fast and the Furious. Every time I watch this movie, my adrenaline starts pumping every time there is a racing scene and by the end I just want to go jump in car and race! 
All in all, this is one of my favorite movies of all time and I will never get tired of watching it. I highly recommend this film to anyone, especially if you like street racing and/or import cars.",hembreedg,2018-10-09,2018

10.0,Review for film,This film is very good the way the film was directed was amazing. the story line had a lot of plot twists. The camera work in the film is amazing it has a lot of exaggerated angles and a panoramic shots also. The part I like best about the film is that it has a great story line with a lot of action in the film. Paul walker in the film was not originally supposed to play the part of Brian but he did an amazing job at playing the part and he is now one of the most recognized actors from the franchise. Brian in this movie is an undercover cop who is trying to catch the group of people who have been robbing semi trucks and there are three suspects however Brian seems to think that Vin Diesel ( Dominic torreto) is not the leader of the group who is taking on the semi trucks until he learns towards the end of the movie. The movie is great and I recommend if you have not seen the movie watch it the movie does not disappoint.,scottdelcarpio,2018-10-29,2018

10.0,THIS NOW FALLS INTO THE NOSTALGIA REALM,My car club was asked to help premier this movie at our local regal cinema. We were parked on the sidewalk right in front of the box office. There was so much hype. It was electric and the crowds were loving the idea of the cars to go along with the premier. The movie was and still is amazing. We helped premier the next several movies when we were in the area and not showing up and down the east coast. Those were great times and this movie embodies that.,Dhouser809,2018-11-13,2018
10.0,The start of it all,"Fast and Furious. The first one. This film came out a month before I was born, and I've only just watched now in 2018. Do I like it? Does it hold up? Let me explain.
Ever since I can remember, I've been into cars. Always have, always will be. Now, when Hollywood tries to make a film about car culture, did they get it right? Sort of.
This movie has so much good about it. The story is just solid. Car guys and girls just being themselves, sticking together. Lets you know a bit of what its like to have a crew. All the cars are iconic. Dom's Black Dodge Charger and Red Mazda RX-7, Brian's Orange Toyota Supra and Green Mitsubishi Eclipse. So many other cars that back in the day and even today look absurd with the styling and parts, but are classics because of the movies that made them. And this movie started all of it. You can't talk about tuner culture or drag racing or even Paul Walker without bringing this film up. This film had its rough spots, but those imperfections are what make this film so iconic and loved.
So, did Hollywood make a car film true to the culture? It's 50/50. They got the racing and the tuning and the whole feel of the scene, but also added in the heists and back turning that is so classic Hollywood. This film is classic, and still means something to me today.",jackfull,2018-11-19,2018

8.0,Guilty Pleasure,"On an objective scale, this film is pretty cheesy. It's a direct ripoff of Point Break. The acting from Walker and a few others is pretty terrible. Every scene is unrealistic...But why do we watch movies? We watch because we enjoy them. And I can't help but enjoy this film.It almost feels like it's in the same world as Training Day. Not as dark (and certainly not nearly as good as Training Day). But it captures LA very well. And nostalgia runs through this film like crazy. Makes me sad to know those days are over. And even sadder to know that Walker is gone.",drhoads-93743,2019-01-07,2019
10.0,Best of the Series! No question!,"I'm surprised this has one of the lowest ratings of the series!
What makes me love this film above all the others? Well, there's a few things:This is the original, the best! Before Hollywood took it and threw into unrealistic scenarios and laughable over the top action sequences.This movie at its core is about friendship and the close bonds the main characters hold for one another. Lengths a person will go to for those they love.It keeps things simple, street racing, robbery, fist fights and racial feuds. Why do audiences need cars jumping from high rise to high rise and over the top villains with pointless back stories and agenda's?It's realistic (to a degree) has impressive actor chemistry, makes you care for the characters and their close bonds. Fun storyline, high stress action sequences. You really don't need more to create a great film, if written and executed correctly.On a side note I will say, at this time of his career, Paul Walker, cannot act. Thankfully he improved on his talents as he worked in the series more and more. Which is more than you can say for a lot of ""pretty"" men landing high profile film roles in the industry today.10/10 loved it 18years ago and love it still. You cannot beat the classic, the original The Fast & The Furious.",lita-ann88,2019-01-18,2019
6.0,It's great if you don't think about it,"This movie was a lot of fun. It gets a 6 purely because I was entertained while watching it. It knows exactly what it is and who it caters to and doesnt try to be anything else but an over the top racing flick. If you go into it expecting a deep introspection into Paul Walker's character, you'll be thoroughly disappointed. It's a by the numbers movie and I'm sure it was impressive for the time, but the only way one could find value in The Fast and the Furious is if they grab some friends and turn off their brain for a bit.",jetsethradio,2019-02-05,2019
10.0,Action-packed and breath-taking,"The Fast and the Furious is an action movie released on the 22 june 2001 in the United States and the 26 september in France. This film was directed by Rob Cohen and the producers of the movie are Mediastream Film and Ardustry Entertainement. The sound designer is Peter Honness and the writers of this film are Gary Scott Thompson and Ken Li. The composer is B.Wayne Transeau and the actors who are the most well-known are Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster. Paul Walker played the main character of Bryan and Dominic played the main character of Dominic. This film is 106 minutes long and the budget was 38,000,000 $.

The film is about a man named Dominic Toretto who organized illicit games with customed cars in the streets of Los Angeles with his team, they earn money by stealing illicit gasoline and an agent of the C.I.A. (Bryan O'Conner) who investigates these robberies and who tries to befriend this group.

Honetly, this film is short but the budget of this movie is cheap compared to the budget of Harry Potter and Fast and Furious is as good as Harry Potter.

This film is really action-packed and breath-taking. The topic of the movie is thought-provoking because they speak of illegal race cars af is it was normal, it's very funny and cool but it's so dangerous.

The visual effects are extremely beatiful because it's real stunts and there aren't special effects because the explosions, the flames and the rest are real.

The sound designer is cool because the songs in this film are rap and rock and I love it.

It's the film I have seen the most (17 times)

And last but not least, the cars are very beautiful and customed, for the die-hard fans of cars, it's the film that you must see. I didn't like the death of some characters because I found them interesting.

I loved the scene where Dominic discovers that Bryan is an agent of the CIA and at the end, Bryan and Dominic fight in a car race.",9thgraders,2019-02-11,2019
10.0,The OG and the Best,"I'm never one to write reviews, but this film is one of my favorites for multiple reasons. The 2 main characters of Brian and Dom are just a match made in heaven with Paul Walker and Vin Diesel playing them respectively. Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez fit perfectly as the love interests and are some of the most badass women I've seen in car films. This film is a timeless classic because of the car chases, the chemistry of the actors, and the greatness of the action displayed with the cars. The directing was really well done for a movie of this scope mixing slow motion in some car sequences with the real time effects of the stunts that the cars are undertaking. The music fits the film well, and it maintains the tone of the film superbly.The original of the fast and furious saga definitely set the bar extremely high for the sequels and luckily some of the sequels have been able to reach and some exceed it.
Most of all this movie is special for me because it was influential in my childhood as it was the first PG-13 movie I ever saw as a child (I was 5) lol.
Just an awesome movie all around. Check it out if you've never seen it before.",TXJoe4-FL813,2019-02-20,2019
5.0,"It was good for a while, but it ended up mediocre.","I'm watching the whole series (I only saw 1 and 2), so this is the first one. I liked it for what it was when I was 15 or something, but even then I knew it wasn't good.Besides the awful acting and mediocre at best dialogue, I have to say It was good (just that, good) for a while, which was surprising. All the set-up was fun, even if dumb of course, and the 2nd act was good, creating tension for Paul Walker's character.And then... they dropped the ball. They made a scene that could've cut a lot of boring minutes of this movie, and justify the ending at the same time.And yet, they keep going, wasting all the tension just to have a stupid last motivation for the characters to be where the writers wanted them to be. Again, they didn't need the dumb Hollywood 3rd act because by the end of the second they had the characters in good position to finish the movie. But they wanted more chases, and races, and cars blowing up, and they made a bit of a boring flatter ending.It's ""ok fun"", 5 points.",educallejero,2019-03-24,2019
2.0,Two stars for this comedy!,"It made me laugh so often. I really wanted to get into this Franchise and it got me good: at laughing. There was no real Story, no acting nothing but fast cars and hot 90's Babes. When Sean was introduced into the gang there where females who wanted to be males. The only racing Girl of course had a barby colored car. It made me cringe everytime they switched from on Driver to another everytime trying to get out a cool setence like: you're next. I´'ll Show you what I got. Eat my dust, Boy. I can only guess they financed all those expensive cars and stuff because of the product Placement. Als the animations made us snort into our drínks when they hit the red button on the driving wheel. Everyone always got smashed in their seats but so badly I was reminded of the early star trek series when the actors shook themselves instead of the camera when they where hit by a Meteor shower. The safety precautions came quite short in the movie. I haven't seen any seatbelts, or safety clothing. Even when they crashed, nobody got hurt.

I had to admitt It often looked like, it's ok to take risks in driving. Nothing will hapen, no one gets hurt or arrested. Women will always offer themselves willingly, even if your are mean and ugly. There is always Money to build new cars. Have I mentioned that women will always offers themselves willingly?",lythis-love,2019-04-18,2019
7.0,"Kinetic, ""hip"" street-racing flick with Vin Diesel and Paul Walker","A newbie to Los Angeles (Paul Walker) falls for a cafÃ© host (Jordana Brewster) while trying to join a street-racing gang led by her brother, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel). Meanwhile the LAPD are trying to apprehend a radical group on the highways that targets semis and their valuable cargo. Michelle Rodriguez is on hand as Dom's babe while Matt Schulze plays an angry member of his gang.""The Fast and the Furious"" (2001) was the beginning of the popular street-racing franchise that currently has eight movies with two more planned. The over-the-top action is akin to ""The Road Warrior"" (1981) while the tone mixes the comic book melodrama of ""The Warriors"" (1979) and ""Torque"" (2004) with the more serious air of ""Grand Canyon"" (1991) and ""Training Day"" (2001). (Yes, I realize ""Torque"" and ""Training Day"" debuted after this one; I'm just providing comparative references).Speaking of the tone, there's no goofiness and the actors take everything dead seriously, which is good in my book, but the flick has several unintentional laughs because, while quasi-realistic, the thrills & posing are so exaggerated.Brewster and Rodriguez are effective in the feminine department, but neither do much for me personally. There are a few good-looking ladies in the periphery, however.The soundtrack contains several dynamic urban numbers, including the excellent ""Deep Enough"" by Live.The movie runs 1 hour, 46 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles & nearby areas (San Bernardino, Hemet, Malibu, Westminster, Beverly Hills, etc.).GRADE: B",Wuchakk,2019-05-08,2019

The action / car racing is pretty good, it's the early ages of CGI so the shots aren't the best, but most of the real racing holds its own.

Vin Diesel, the headline costar, takes on his usual character: a growling, flexing, ultra-chill bro with shady connections but an open heart. Neither are particularly likable or interesting.The whole thing is shallower than a toilet bowl, ticking so many ""cool point"" boxes that it mimics a rich, forgettable, three-minute music video. We've got fast cars, gorgeous sex objects, adrenaline-rich action scenes, loud radio hits (juuust a bit dated) and a posh location or two. Not much in the way of meaningful character arcs or deeper substance.It's a true ""what you see is what you get"" experience. Big and dumb and gruff and insecure, with a plot that varies from meaningless to pointless and a versatile cast with nothing to do beyond gripping the steering wheel (or each other) and looking sexy.

6.0,Not Great But Solid,"Fast and the Furious franchise is one of the best examples of vicarious entertainment in the movie industry. Anyone who likes action, nice cars, racing, women etc. will find enjoyment from this movie and this franchise in one way or another. This film is a basic popcorn flic. There is not deep plot or deep characters here. So people looking for those elements in this film will be disappointed. However, most people probably knew not to expect such elements from a movie like this anyway, from the title to the trailers. I knew what I was getting when I watched this. So I enjoyed this film alright.The story isn't the most original. It's essentially Point Break, but admittedly done better, in my opinion. The characters are not great, though the characters are not what people are looking for in this movie anyway. The film stars Brian O'Conner, played by Paul Walker (RIP), who is an FBI agent. Paul Walker does fine overall in the film. His character I rooted for. However, I do not by for one second that this guy is an FBI agent. Nothing about his character makes be believe he would qualify for the FBI. When he tries to sound professional, it's not believable.Vin Diesel does good in the film as well. I am a fan of Vin Diesel as an actor. He is one of my favorite aspects of the film. Michelle Rodriguez is also in the film, but does not have that much to do. The side cast is fine. I did not really care for them, but I never found them annoying.The action and racing is the highlight of the film and it's done well. The races are fun, and the action (mainly car chases) will have you at the edge of your seat.Overall, I enjoyed the film. It's not a deep movie, but it's not supposed to be. It's a popcorn flick meant to appeal to guys, and especially teenage guys. That's why I call it vicarious entertainment. Every guy secretly dreams about being an action hero, driving a nice car, getting all the women. So many guys secretly would envision themselves as Paul Walker or Vin Diesel's character, or one of the other character in the film. That's why I say this is vicarious entertainment.",mitchell5954,2019-08-17,2019
9.0,4K Blu-ray gives this movie a nice tune up,"he Fast and the Furious

This is the movie that started the mega franchise we all know of today. However the series stalled and ran out of gas after the third entry and it was only when Fast Five offered a overhaul did the franchise get back on track. I personally think the fifth instalment is the best of the bunch but only winning by an inch not a mile. 2001's 'The Fast and the Furious comes in close second and is actually a loose remake of Kathryn Bigelow's 'Point Break' but with cars instead of surfboards.

'TFATF', we'll call it that because I can't be arsed to keep writing out the full title is directed by Rob Cohen and stars Vin Diesel and the late Paul Walker. Walker plays Officer Brian O'Conner who goes undercover to catch a gang of truck robbers. By doing so he gets embroiled in the world of street racing. 'TFATF' is pure carnogaraphy. If like me you're a petrol head then this movie will be right up your alley. Performances by all are fantastic, especially from Diesel as hard-man Dom Toretto and the aforementioned Paul Walker. All cast members are great and one of this films less talked about attributes is the strong character development of those onscreen.

Action is a plenty in this movie and at the time of release the Car racing sequences did move the game on. 'TFATF' is borderline silly unlike the sequels which have become even more ridiculous with each latest instalment.

On 4K Blu-ray 'TFATF' looks good. A thin layer of grain lays over a mostly crisp image. This is the best this movie has ever looked. The grain gives the movie a cinematic look and the refreshed transfer is packed with detail. HDR allows the paintwork of the wonderful automobiles to pop like never before. Skin tones can sometimes look a little over baked for my taste but overall the film does look sublime. The blue of Paul Walkers eyes make him look like one of those creepy dudes from Game Of Thrones, but this is testament to how good HDR is on this transfer. Audio gets a belting DTS X mix and this is one to bring the house down. Bass is really punchy. So much so that I had to disengage the Dynamic EQ on my Home Theatre receiver. The films soundtrack pumps out with a beat so heavy furniture may move. Surround effects are constant and height channels are working overtime. This DTS X mix is best described as being rather Furious.

I enjoyed revisiting this movie. It's been given a new lease of life on 4K Blu-ray",stevenrotherforth,2019-08-22,2019

For this, he receives the help of his childhood friend Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson), and secret agent Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes). Despite the movie had two scripts with Vin Diesel and one without him was better anyway! Engaging plot, simply magnificent script and breathtaking racing scene.

What an acting by late actor Paul Walker & Vin Diesel.

4.0,Dumber than dumb!,"Dumber than dumb! This is the movie that spawned a dynasty of sorts and encouraged numerous little boy and girl racers the world over to turn up the gas. It's a crime caper with a fetish, not just for sleek, fast cars, but for handsome men with buffed up torsos, (the 'attraction' between leads Paul Walker and Vin Diesel makes this possibly the most homoerotic movie of its decade). Ironically, and tragically, Walker himself was to die in a motor accident several films down the line.There isn't a frame of this nonsense you can believe in and the driving sequences, which make up most of the movie, are the stuff of fantasy. Nevertheless, enough boys, (and girls), with a penchant for boy's toys loved this enough to make 'The Fast and the Furious' movies one of the most successful franchises of all time.

4.0,The Fast and the Furious (2001),"Directed by Rob Cohen. Starring Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, Matt Schulze, Michelle Rodriguez, Chad Lindberg, Thom Barry, Ted Levine, Rick Yune, Johnny Strong, Noel Gugliemi. (PG-13)The FBI and LAPD send Walker undercover to infiltrate a crew of racing enthusiasts that pulls off highway heists, ends up befriending their leader (Diesel) and getting romantically involved with his sister (Brewster). So...""Point Break"" with fast cars replacing surfboards, except this one might actually be even dumber (plus, director Cohen is no Kathryn Bigelow). Drive-in fodder souped up for exploitation cinema's modern era; would eventually spawn a long-running franchise, but in retrospect, feels refreshingly quaint, even grounded. Granted, the script ignores logic and reality at regular intervals, but the stakes are reasonably low and the stuntwork usually seems to exist in the real world. Ardent fans of shiny cars and street racing will probably enjoy it to some degree; for anyone else, it's no better than a way to kill time and appreciate the absence of Tyrese Gibson's witless-cisms. Rapper Ja Rule has a bit part and also contributes a song or two to the ear-splitting soundtrack.45/100",fntstcplnt,2020-01-31,2020

2.0,The testosterone reaches critical mass quite early in this ridiculously self-indulgent nitrous oxide orgasm.,"Paul Walker gets his breakout role as an undercover cop, one with very little interest in actually doing any police work, who falls in with a crew of enterprising gear heads on the midnight street racing circuit. Vin Diesel, the headline costar, takes on his usual character: a growling, flexing, ultra-chill bro with shady connections but an open heart. Neither are particularly likable or interesting. The whole thing is shallower than a toilet bowl, ticking so many ""cool point"" boxes that it mimics a rich, forgettable, three-minute music video. We've got fast cars, gorgeous sex objects, adrenaline-rich action scenes, loud radio hits (juuust a bit dated) and a posh location or two. Not much in the way of meaningful character arcs or deeper substance. It's a true ""what you see is what you get"" experience. Big and dumb and gruff and insecure, with a plot that varies from meaningless to pointless and a versatile cast with nothing to do beyond gripping the steering wheel (or each other) and looking sexy. On this first go-around, at least, the action retains some passing association with reality. Points for that.",eminkl,2020-04-17,2020

Even though I watched this movie before, even now I watched the train scene with excitement, holding my breath.I wish it would have been better without erotic scenes in the movie.

7.0,Surprisingly good,"Officer Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) goes undercover in the Los Angeles street racing circuits in order to find out which of the racing crews is committing crimes with their muscle cars. But going undercover is never easy, especially with such affable miscreants.The basic premise is really nothing special. But then again, it doesn't need to be. The point of this movie is in its style. It has fast cars, lots of racing, lots of hot, greased-up babes, muscle-heavy men (and cars) and a killer soundtrack. You don't watch it to be intrigued by carefully orchestrated plot points or tragic backstories or the heaviness of its pathos. No, you watch it to kick back, relax and have a good time.And in delivering that, the movie more than delivers. But if it was just that, I'd probably rate the film a bit lower. What actually elevates this film above its immediate peers and helped launch a huge franchise, is the fact that this film is punching above its weight class and succeeding. And it does that by having some real good actors playing roles they were born to play. Walker is one of them, but I also have to mention Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez.The dialogue is also surprisingly snappy and memorable. The plot, while basic, succeeds in making you care for these characters, and it also manages to make itself feel novel, despite arguably being at least a little clichÃ©d. Once again, the fact that you care for these characters matters a lot.Not a groundbreaking movie by any means, but it has surprising quality underneath all the testosterone being forcibly pumped into your veins.",Vartiainen,2020-05-04,2020

9.0,A iconic Action Film,"A movie that for its time was a first of its kind, Hollywood had never seen a movie involving illegal street racing. Little to everyone's knowledge that this first startup movie in 2001 would lead to a long and ongoing series of movies. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) Is a LAPD officer assigned to investigate Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) under suspicion of multiple high speed truck robberies. O'Connor quickly meets Toretto in the street racing scene, Toretto takes O'Connor under his wing and gives him a place to stay as well as helps him build a new car. Throughout the time O'Connor is with Toretto he falls in love with not only his new environment but also Toretto's sister. The Movie doesn't only portray the criminal activity like street racing, running from the police, and robbery of semis carrying Blu Ray Players but shows bonds being made between two completely different worlds and a true feeling throughout Toretto's group known to him as family. O'Connor works so well into the family that when it's time to step in and do his job to bust the family for the thefts he can't do it and feels like he's betraying the family. The movie is beriddled with effects from the early 2000s and at some point shows poor editing. The movie has many interesting little quirks that the average person watching the movie might not notice but to its intended audience of car guys shows. One recognizable scene that is laughed upon is the first race scene of the movie of the movie Brian goes to spray Nitrous Oxide into the motor and the passenger footwell floor pan just falls right out of the car. How those to relate or even nearly are possible is out there and foolish. Looking past its few small quirks and editing issues the film was quite a good turn out. The film was low budget and to the studio seemed like a one and done film but turned into something much bigger. A cool fact is the cars used in the film were cars built by actual people throughout the state of california. To wrangle up some car ideas they invited a large group or car tuners to bring down their car to the movie studio and from the directors chose which cars would star in the movie. The cast brought the movie together with good chemistry and put on an amazing performance with most not really being seen in any big buck films before. The Fast and The Furious for most was a movie that brought together the car community and created dreams for the members of all with this action movie. The movie would go on to make a total of 10 action packed movies. The Fast and Furious movie was and will continue to be an amazing movie not only for its action scenes but its depiction of street racing and the car community in the early 2000s which is largely the same today.",wiserurchin,2020-06-04,2020
7.0,The Fast and the Furious,Overall Rating 6.8: The Fast and the Furious is a good enough film with plenty of cool cars and likeable characters.

4.0,First of many,"Twenty years ago - has it been that long? - Paul Walker and director Rob Cohen made The Skulls together. Cohen got a deal with producer Neal H. Moritz and Universal Pictures. Looking for ideas, he asked Walker what his dream action movie would be. The answer? A mix of Days of Thunder and Donnie Brasco. After a May 1998 issue of Vibe detailed New York City's street racing scene, they had their film. All they needed was a co-star.

After Gone In 60 Seconds, Universal wanted Timothy Olyphant but they got Moritz's pick instead: Vin Diesel, hot off the success of Pitch Black. And then, seventy-eight wrecked cars later, we had a movie. Any similarity to the D.B. Sweeney and Charlie Sheen film No Man's Land - which came out thirteen years before - is surely coincidental.

LAPD officer Brian O'Conner (Walker) has gone undercover to infiltrate the gang that has been stealing from trucks and disappearing. He soon makes it into the gang led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), who has been banned from pro racing after attacking the man who accidentally killed his father, but complicating matters is that he soon falls for Dominic's sister Letty (Jordanna Brewster).

This movie was originally entitled Racer X (the name of the Vibe article), Race Wars and Redline, but then someone had the brilliant idea to ask Roger Corman if they could use the title of his 1955 film The Fast and the Furious. Getting paid again for a movie he already made? I can only imagine how delighted Corman had to be at the prospect.

This movie made stars of both Walker and Diesel. Waker would work with Ted Levine again - he plays one of his bosses here - in Joyride, while Diesel would refuse to be in the next few sequels to this movie.

6.0,Simple beginnings,"This review contains spoilers.

The Fast and The Furious is an action movie starring Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, and Michelle Rodriguez. The Fast and the Furious is an action movie that uses race cars as its main action set piece. The story follows Brian O'Conner, an undercover cop played by Paul Walker, that tracks a group of hijackers that utilize race cars.

The story is really an excuse to have high octane car chases and races. From the beginning, the story opens with a car chase with the race cars in view. This scene shows the series prioritizes these scenes. I do not have a problem with this as the series is great in its ability to have some weight to its well-done action scenes. The racing scenes have not aged well with many gratuitous scenes, but this is acceptable as it is a view of both the times and culture of street racers.

There are some plot holes that the audience should ignore because of the movie's focus. The main one is Brian O'Conner's willingness to allow Dominic Toretto to go free. It was strange to see as Brian never felt like a cop and should have never been part of the force. It felt more fitting that Brian be a racer attempting to work his way up rather than as an undercover cop. There would have been more street races with this route.

Vin Diesel does a good job as Dominic Toretto and the movie absolutely needed his character. I did like the route the movie took with trying to establish him as a father figure to his crew. This does feel cheesy at times but it is entertaining.

The action scenes are the complete focus here. You should only be watching this movie for the action. This is what made the movie a summer blockbuster hit. With the actors in their places, this movie excels at these scenes.

The Fast and the Furious is not a complete movie. The movie tilts to the action side too much. This is at least enjoyable and it should be the reason to watch this movie.

7.0,Kicks Off The Franchise!,"This is my first time seeing this film after only seeing the 4th entry onwards! I found the film to be alright!

Los Angeles police officer Brian O'Conner must decide where his loyalty really lies when he becomes enamored with the street racing world he has been sent undercover to destroy.

I found the film to be decent! It has some great racing scenes, eye candy & some epic action sequences, while it's not outstanding, it's an alright starter for one of the greatest franchise ever!

Overall, a great yet mindless action flick with girls & cars! 7/10.",vengeance20,2021-04-04,2021

10.0,A Great car film starring tough guys and chicks,This film is the best car movie it has action romance and violence!! I know critics are hating this film this is the first in the series I love how Paul walker is a police or fbi to stop toretto but then becomes friends with him vin diesel put his soul in this movie to give u his best performance!!! So give him respect!!! And then Paul walker turns to street racing and stops being a cop then we go on that story line of Paul trying to turn against the FBI and then they bust the Chinese racers then it's just somewhat of a mess but hey it will entertain a 12 to 13 year old anyway!!!,bethlori,2021-04-22,2021

but becomes friend with leader of the gang and falls in love with his sister.Story is old cliche but it has that old school feeling of good action movie with macho main characters, beautiful women and great race cars. Now with 9 sequel in motion this first one is still about street race and not Jame Bond style movie.And the big bonus is great soundtrack with music that forces you too hit a gas pedal.",sikeone55-1,2021-05-01,2021

4.0,Wonderfully Dated,"2001's The Fast and the Furious was the film that launched a billion-dollar franchise. After seeing the film it was remarkable that it went past one film. It was a more low key film considering how ridiculous The Fast and the Furious franchise became, it was more a crime film with street racing and was pretty much a remake of Point Break. It was a wonderfully dated film because the soundtrack was filled with techno, Ja Rule hip-hop and nu-metal.",freemantle_uk,2021-05-16,2021

7.0,As the title says!,"Amazingly It's taken me exactly twenty years to see my first Fast And The Furious movie and eventually I plan on watching them all.I enjoyed this more than I was expecting, so if they get better as the franchise goes along , I'm in for a treat .Los Angeles police officer Brian O'Conner must decide where his loyalty really lies when he becomes enamored with the street racing world he has been sent undercover to destroy.Having just bought a sports car myself , I found the display of cars fascinating, especially because some of them will be seen as vintage compared to today .The story itself is nothing to write home about . In fact when you think about it , it's quite ridiculous. These street racers aren't kids but they are acting like teenagers and they just happen to have 2k rolled up in their pockets to bet when they race against each other! .
The whole undercover cop thing doesn't work.It makes little sense but really that's not important because the beauty of this film is its look.It's extremely colourful and has that computer race game feel about it.I enjoyed it and I'm looking forward to the next in series .",valleyjohn,2021-06-04,2021

I just watched Fast Furious 9 and I am so dissapointed with F9.. This one is the beginning ... Newer Fast Furious movies just go in the WRONG direction... They should focus with street racing just like this one... I really like street racing movie just like Fast Furious 1 and FF tokyo drift... Fast Furious 1 IMO is the best from all FF movies so far... The storyline is good... Acting was superb.... Plot and character development is good... Music is good.... And awesome street racing scenes!.... I wonder why this have low score review? ... This movies should be have average about 8.0 at imdb.,alexfrey-75147,2021-06-16,2021
8.0,weirdly one of my favs,"I have a weird love for this movie. Maybe its the fact that I grew up re watching this it with my siblings, but after years of the Fast and The Furious franchise this is the movie that gave us the most. The new movies, where all of these characters seem to be invisible and in most occasions gravity does not apply to them suck. In my opinion The Fast franchise should've ended after Paul Walker's passing. In a way it felt weird to watch the following movies after his untimely passing. All in all this movie will always be one of my favorites, even when it is not the greatest.",marwillreview,2021-06-17,2021

5.0,Doesn't Hold Up,"I was in high school when this came out. Back then I thought it was amazing. Watching it now....you would think that this was a straight to video production. Any scene that involves Paul Walker is just cringe worthy. People always give Keanu Reeves a bad wrap for his acting abilities, but Paul Walker is just terrible in this movie. The only saving grace is the action sequences. I also enjoyed the big brother subplot between Dom and Brian. The acting is what brings this movie down for me. I'll rewatch it in 10 years and reminisce how we used to drive cars ran with gasoline.",volleyer,2021-06-27,2021
5.0,Watching it 20 years later it's outdated,I liked the film when I was 16 now watching it 20 years later it hasn't aged well. Maybe it's not great cause you know how the franchise will become. The story drags on and there's not much too it also. It's so early 2000's it's funny. It's not a bad film but there's nothing special about it.,jakethesnake-42007,2021-06-27,2021
8.0,The Fast and the Furious,"This was a solid movie. Sure, it was super cheesy, the acting was questionable (It gets way better later in the series), and the plot was kind of funny, but other than that, I really enjoyed this movie, it was the one that started it all, a saga currently 20 years in the making. I have seen all the movies, and it is cool to look and see the original crew, Dom, Letty, Jesse, Leon, and Vince. I mentioned the plot was kind of funny, but the story was great. I loved how Brian was an undercover cop but in the process, he became close with Dom, his sister Mia, and most of his crew. The ending made the movie, it was great, and it was that point that set up the entire Saga.I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to watch it. It is a great movie to watch anytime, and it also opens you up to an entire Saga of movies.**A lot of people don't know this, but there is a Credit Scene at the end of the credits.**",kaden_lewis,2021-07-01,2021
10.0,Definitely in my top 10,This movie is great and so nostalgic to me. Everyone looks so young and vibrant and everything about this movie is just great. It has so much heart and the direction is smooth as hell. Definitely one of my favorite movies of all time.,TheGravyTrain05,2021-07-06,2021
6.0,A buddy movie with a heart,"This was my first experience with the Fast and Furious series and I wasn't disappointed. A charming Hollywood version of Rebel Without a Cause mixed with a somewhat unconvincing heist film. But at heart it's an old fashioned buddy movie, with Vin Diesel and Paul Walker as handsome and charismatic leads. (It's no surprise that they would return for future episodes of the series, until Walker's tragic death in 2013.) Not much is made of their female counterparts, played by a sultry Michelle Rodriguez and the very beautiful Jordana Brewster. You might say that the real leads of this film are the cars, but although a lot is made of the technical side of things, the focus fortunately is on the people behind the wheel. The car chases and races that the series is known for are great though. It's one of those films where as a viewer you get the idea that the actors all got on in real life and that it was real fun to make. Unpretentious film making at its best and a great introduction to one of the most successful film series of all times.",edwinbodegraaf,2021-07-07,2021
6.0,cars and nostalgia feels,"The Fast and the Furious (2001) is pretty good movie for someone who love cars, especially street race.

8.0,Action and heart,"One thing Vin Deisel can do is bring heart to his character, whether it is an action movie or a SciFi thriller. This movie is about more than fast cars. Good action. Characters with depth. Good cast. Good direction. I give this film an 8 (great) out of 10 [Action, Drama]",nancyldraper,2021-07-10,2021
7.0,"Simple plot, average acting but still entertains","The Fast and the Furious is an action film directed by Rob Cohen and stars Late Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Rick Yune, Chad Lindberg, Johnny Strong, and Ted Levine.The movie is first installment of fast and furious franchise.This movie is considered as one of the best movie of the franchise and i also watched the movie with lots of expectations but was subtly unsatisfied primarily due to the plot which is very simple it's execution which is straight and the acting as apart from Walker most of the characters were not up-to the mark.Plot of the movie is very simple and very predictable and will not offer you anything exciting in terms of any twists or turns but since the movie is on car races it has a fast screenplay and the viewers might not get distracted.The acting is average and apart from Paul Walker no one is that impressive, Vin Diesel was average and barring few scenes was majorly flat faced, Michelle Rodriguez had featured in few action movies and she is quite similar to another action movies she had featured in, rest of the cast were similar and acting was either average or below par. Climax of the movie is also predictableOverall the movie is quite simple with predictable story and predictable execution but still the movie doesn't disappoint and can be watched once. Street car racing movie lovers will like the movie. Can be watched once but without expectations and the movie will entertain you.",sauravjoshi85,2021-07-15,2021
5.0,Don't Get Me Wrong,"Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of the Fast and the Furious franchise. However, there is a reason that it was 8 years until you saw this crew together again. The racing was enjoyable but the acting was mediocre (especially Paul Walker).

While this film gets points for launching one of the most popular film franchises in history, the plot is jumbled and much of it lacks real purpose. It seems like the writers had a bunch of ""good ideas"" and threw them on a board before half-heartedly putting them in a plausible order to create a plot. The fight scene on the semi-truck seems completely out of place (put it after Jesse's death instead) and the final 1/4 mile with Dom and Brian is a forced.

Overall, the film has heart, the cast has chemistry and I'm glad it happened, I just didn't like watching it.",jace_the_film_guy,2021-07-16,2021
7.0,"""I live my life a quarter mile at a time.""","I'm really late to the party on this one since it's now twenty years old. My reservation has always been watching a mindless action flick with over the top stunts and CGI enhanced special effects. Well, I wasn't let down in my assumption, but if you can pardon the pun, it was a pretty wild ride. Vin Diesel is one of those bad guys you can't help rooting for, he's like Ric Flair or Randy Savage in the wrestling world. His character is Dom Toretto, leader of a street racing gang, excuse me, 'team', and the story line is built around him and undercover cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), who infiltrates the racing community in order to stop a string of trailer hijackings. The racing action is to be expected, and even somewhat believable until you get to that manic hijacking where the truck driver is pretty adept at protecting his rig, while O'Conner jumps in to pull Toretto's fat out of the fire, along with his top gunslinger Vince (Matt Schulze). It wouldn't be a hot car flick without some hot babes and you have that as well with a couple romantic angles thrown in, but the main attraction is the street cars and the unparalleled stunts they're asked to perform. There's a reason it's called 'Fast and Furious'.

7.0,"Fast, fun and silly","I finally decided to give this movie a chance, some 20 years later, knowing what i was getting into. It's not a movie masterpiece, it's full of cliches (buddy cop / heist movie / bromance driven flick), the CGI is silly, the characters are pretty one-dimensional, and the story lacks cohesiveness. Also, acting is all over the place, but this is Vin Diesel we are talking about, not the likes of Pacino, DeNiro or Hoffman.Yet, it's a fun movie to watch, that delivers great amounts of action sprinkled with some humor.In many Ways, this movie is exactly what i thought it would be, and that's a good thing. I really enjoyed watching it, while also doing some coding work at the same time, bc it doesn't really ask for a lot of focus.I'm happy i decided to watch, and I'm willing to give the franchise a chance.",fernandodelamadrid,2021-09-23,2021
4.0,Cut the chit chat. We want to see racing!,"If I were alive in my full senses in 2001 and had seen The Fast and the Furious, there is no way I could have possibly thought that this film will turn into a full blown franchise in the coming years. I mean the whole concept of these films is basically the cutscenes of a Need for Speed game. But still since I thought probably this franchise is supposed to be about something other than that too, I decided to give it a watch just to prove myself wrong. And I was wrong. This franchise isn't just about the racing. It's also about talking, talking and even more talking.The Fast and the Furious is not exactly a kind of a film that I would call memorable. The only scenes I remember from it are the beginning where Brian does the illegal street racing, the part where his secret identity is blown up and where the team is doing the truck stunts (I only remember that part because of the meme template). Other than that when it comes to this film, my mind literally goes blank. And wouldn't it be? I was watching it without subtitles in the metro while travelling for college. When I do this I only remember the most memorable scenes from a movie. From here I only remembered that much.I really liked the character of Brian. It's really sad that Paul Walker is no longer with us. He's literally the reason why I decided to continue watching this franchise, otherwise I'd have given up just like I did for Stuart Little, Hotel Transylvania and Jurassic Park. Thankfully this franchise becomes better with the sequels and redeems the name. I also liked Dominic in this film (but just this one). His dialogue about not mattering whether we lose by an inch or a mile really made me ponder a lot.Honestly this really goes above my head how a film with so much talking turned into what it is today. It's like if you don't give up on a bad film you can actually create an empire and then redeem your old films (looking at you Warner Bros). This film has gained a cult status among the fans and I respect that decision. I would have loved to rewatch this film to prove myself wrong, but remembering how much talking happens in it and the fact that it doesn't have the same payoff as a superhero or sci-fi movie really turns me off.",Puroo,2021-09-23,2021

Movies like this, those that are god-awful, but rake in tons of cash, are a cry for help from this generation.

It has been praised for the action sequences, but even those where pretty dreadful with shaky cameras and little drama or inventiveness.I was tempted to quit watching but I was hoping for some redemption but it never came.

7.4423076923076925,First Movie In The Series,"Brian is an undercover cop who is sent to prove himself by investigating car racers. Brian goes to the restaurant where Mia, Dom's sister runs the place. Dom sits in the back reading. Dom's team shows up and one person mentions that the dude wants to get into Mia's pants, angering Vince. Vince has a crush on Mia and he fights with Brian to try to scare him from his territory. Brian shows up in a beautiful green car to the car race where he offers the pink slip to his car in the bet. We see early 2000s fashion styles and many girls wear tank tops and jeans. Dom eventually agrees and they all race. Brian has 2 cylinders of ""nos"" that eventually becomes too much. It is announced that the police are no longer distracted by the homicide and are now coming. Everyone races to get out of the area. Dom parks his car and walks out, thinking he is safe. A police officer turns around and yells at Dom to surrender. Brian happens to be in the area and encourages Dom to get into his car. Brian helps Dom escape and so Dom invites him to the party. Brian gets closer with Mia who even changes when she sees he is coming inside the home. We see briefly her completely nude when she takes off her top. Brian eventually sleeps with her and receives a phone call regarding the Vietnamese boys' warrant. Tran is having a dinner with his family in their beautiful home when the SWAT team comes in. Tran gets slapped in the face by his father. Brian finds out that the truck drivers are now arming themselves against the heisters. Dom and the team leaves except for Mia and this makes Brian realize they are the heisters. Brian reveals to Mia that he is a cop and that she has to help him to save the team. Brian manages to save Vince and calls in for a helicopter, revealing his police identity to the rest of the team. Dom looks angry until he has to focus back on Vince. The team leaves and Dom drives to Dom's home where he has his dad's car out on the driveway. Dom says he needs to go save Jesse who lost in the race so the Viet guys will be after him. In a drive-by shooting, Jesse is shot dead by the Vietnamese and Brian chases after them. Brian shoots Tran dead. Dom and Brian drive right past a train. Brian hands Dom the keys to his car to allow him to escape the area. Brian says he owes Dom a 10-second car. After the credits roll we see that Dom is driving relaxingly.",vivianla,2021-12-26,2021
9.0,Genuinely great,"I saw this in the cinema when it first came out, loved it ever since, I think it's the best in the series.

In general, the film is 10/10, the beginning of the afterburner industry, when you were really sitting waiting for other parts, they don't do that anymore. Definitely the best in parts.

9.0,A great movie to watch for fun,"Everyone's favorite street racing movie, which is where it all started when the franchise was about illegal racing and not about saving the world from terrorists, when it comes to making movies, sometimes less is more, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker have great chemistry and an interesting dynamic that has become a modern classic. I definitely recommend watching it, it's not the first time I've reviewed all the films in this franchise, but I like this one, the first one, the best.

3.0,The best of the worst,"The Fast and Furious series is brain-dead and shallow in plot, yet this is the best of them. However in typical early 2000's movie making, they focus too much on the action, corny cliche lines used for the promos and a pointless love plot and disregard anything that resembles character development or a narrative.The female characters have no use in this movie. It's all part of being PC. The. Brian-Mia subplot was unnecessary and, if removed, would have made the movie better and no one would have questioned why there wasn't a love interest. The doting looks at the camera/Brian are cringeworthy at best, too.Same goes with Letty. She barely says a word throughout the movie and is simply there to get out of a car, look cool and make a partially-sexy pose for the slo-mo camera shot. Pointless.I know this was written by a car magazine 'journalist', but surely he knew what was cliche and could have avoided it or at least added something that we hadn't seen in every other 'fast' action movie aimed at 20somethings?",yorktown_hawk,2022-01-21,2022
7.0,The Things We Do For Love,"The one that started it all, FF1 slowly and calmly explores the depths of the human soul, all in a world overflowing with a dazzling array of mesh tank tops where the siren songs of Limp Bizkit ooze out of every overpriced trunk-installed subwoofer.

Undercover cop Brian Earl Spilner McGillicuddy O'Conner is tasked with tracking down an inefficient band of truckjackers after a series of robberies where they have hauled in a combined total of $6 million (*2001 retail value) of Panasonic DVD players and 13"" TV/VCR combos (*2001 street value $6,000, 2022 value $6.00).

Embedding himself as a stockboy in popular boutique Harry's House of NOS and Chrome, Brian makes his first attempt at underworld entrée by stalking street-racing king Dom at the Toretto family cafe/junk shop. Brian saunters into the cafe for some sandwich banter with Dom's sister Mia, O'Sloppy's t-shirt neck so stretched out that national security experts agree it directly influenced the infamous white T worn by 9/11 plotter Khalid Sheik Muhammad in the photo taken at the time of his capture. With breath that surprisingly improves with a steady diet of bad tuna sandwiches, Officer O'Stinky finds himself on the wrong end of a hate crime when Dom's chum Vince attacks him outside the cafe. Dom eventually breaks up the fight and gets his first sampling of Spilner Speaks: Brian's answer to a rhetorical question of whether he is a serial killer is ""Nah, man.""

Cut off from his Starkist supplier and his Harry shopboy cover hanging on by a thread, Brian ups the ante while attending his first illegal street race. After rolling up in the taxpayers' Mitsubishi, Officer O'Blivious exits the vehicle looking like LA's most obvious narc since Keanu's Johnny Utah. With his hands in his pockets and a Gee Whiz look on his Opie face, it is not hard to see why the film's working title was The Fast and the Aw Shucks. Credit to Paul Walker's facial acting, though, as the viewer can read the rising horror on his features as he observes one at a time the mostly segregated groups of racers and race fans, Officer O'Busive's mental Rolodex spinning faster than his tires as he thinks back to all the POC he mistreated during profiling traffic stops when he was in uniform.

Wagering the People's pink slip (value $80,000) to gain entry in the $8,000 winner take all affair, Brian and the other drivers defy the laws of physics by taking 2 minutes to drive a quarter mile at speeds of up to 140 miles per hour, delaying an important Stuffed Crust delivery in the process. Plenty of other poor choices were also made post-race this night, each deserving special recognition:

A. Brian stays on the Dom trail despite a much more compelling investigation: whether two spraycan wielding finish line artists are able to crisscross from opposite sides of the street in a straight line without painting each others' shoes.

B. Even if the sudden swarm of squad cars is part of a bigger plan to allow Brian O'Buster to ingratiate himself to Dom with an improbable rescue (and since Dom is not in hiding, has a cafe and repair shop, and the cop chasing him knows his name, why the big chase?), the clumsy cops risk even more property damage than the straight-track street racers.

C. A general mistake by so-called Western Civilization both pre- and post-race: not giving K'ung Fu-Tze more love. Changing the pronunciation of his name to sound like ""confuse us"" to serve your own twisted purpose ranks right up there with anglicizing Cristoffa Corombo and rhyming Demi Moore's given name with phlegmy bore.

D. Mia back at home trying to study upstairs in her bedroom (Is she in high school? Slow down with those Snapples) with Dom's loser friends making an infernal racket downstairs.

E. Also at the Toretto house party another Spilner Speaks: ""Hey buddy, you got a bathroom?"" No, we just go in these Corona bottles, so wiping it off on your shirt ain't gonna help.

F. Mia fails to heed an obvious red flag: if you walk into a room with a dude you barely know and future FF franchise player Luda's voice suddenly says ""I got hoes in different area codes"" the dude you walked in the room with is shady as hell and you need to run as fast-ly and furiously as your little legs can carry you.

The next day Brian's sergeant (Buffalo Bill) stages an elaborate fake arrest to bring his boy in for a debriefing, oddly keeping the cuffs on all the way to the command center, where the hugely overstaffed joint LAPD-FBI task force assigned to recover the $6,000 in stolen Panasonics includes a barista specializing in whipped cream-topped peppermint mocha cappuccinos. Brian eventually secures more funding, this time for a fixer-upper burned-out Toyota Supra. Showing up at Dom's garage (apparently the cafe/junk shop was closed that day) with the tantalizing wreck, Officer O'Shady worms his way into the Toretto crew even though it means they get to see one less mesh tank top overlaying a camo undershirt for a few hours when Vince tantrums away in a screeching cloud of smoke.

As Officer O'Dishrag uses half an industrial-sized bottle of Joy splashing suds while trying to convince possibly-underaged Mia to go out with him, a sign of even more unethical behavior to come, his suspicions that Dom's crew did not steal truckloads of electronics seem to be confirmed when he notices the Toretto microwave does not work and they do not own a dishwasher (but seriously does Dom hate Mia because he just won $6,000 the other day and the average cost of a used portable dishwasher in 2001 was $120). Vince's misguided attempt to insult the dishboy then backfires spectacularly as Mia, likely tired of having to hand-wash all these damn dishes herself, cruelly dangles a date at a Cuban restaurant that Vince wanted to take her to just out of his reach before snatching it back and offering the date to Brian.

With Dom seemingly ruled out as a suspect due to the crappy microwave, Brian sets his sights on the Johnny Tran crew. During a warrantless search of Tran's garage where he spies a couple Panasonic DVD player boxes, he decides not to blow his cover and just watches a man being waterboarded with motor oil, a much more serious crime than the petty thefts he is supposedly investigating. When he reports back his illegally obtained findings the FBI wants to bust Tran, but Brian wisely (for once) cautions against it. The raid accomplishes nothing except traumatizing old Vietnamese people (an American standard, domestically for the new millennium) and driving Tran into a murderous rage.

Meanwhile things are heating up between Brian and Mia, and Dom (sort of) gives the match his blessing. Spilner Speaks even comes up with a perfect line: when Dom says ""You break her heart I'll break your neck"" Brian replies ""That's not gonna happen"" which could refer to either the heart or the neck.

Despite barely knowing Brian, almost everyone on Team Toretto overshares with him immediately: Jesse on his longtime struggle with AD/HD, Dom's traumatic memory of his father's horrific death, and Mia revealing that Letty was only 16 when Dom statched, excuse me, snatched her up. It could just be Brian's big dopey face, but regardless Officer O'Nethical takes advantage of Mia's misplaced trust with a tryst in Harry's shop (which has a bed in it for some reason).

Next stop: Race Wars, and there is only one happening there that demands to be addressed. If there is a big set of those moveable airplane stairs at a huge festival-like gathering and you take it upon yourselves to climb those stairs and dance at the top during the beginning of the throbbing-house-music-filled-transition-to-nighttime scene, at least have the common decency to have better dance moves than that, random uncredited extras.

Trying to put the dancers out of his mind, Officer O'Honesty finally blows his own cover to Mia to try to save her brother from the army of secretly armed truckers just waiting to blast any jackers who try them. Unfortunately for Vince and the rest of Team Toretto they picked the wrong guy when they tried to steal a load from KJ Transport. The driver is so eager to legally kill someone with his sawed-off shotgun that he willingly blasts his Peterbilt to shreds.

With the Spilner cover in similar tatters, Brian confronts Dom back at the house before being interrupted by a Tran motorcycle drive-by that kills Jesse (directly caused by the raid Brian approved while in a compromising position with Mia). After the Fast and the Aw Shucks give chase, Brian kills Tran then celebrates with a quarter mile race and train dodge combo with Dom.

As sirens approach the finish line, Brian O'Conner must make a life-altering decision. He chooses Mia and love, despite the fact that the major string attached is her hopeless and irredeemable brother. As the credits zoom across the screen the sweet sounds of Ja Rule close it out like the final night of Fyre Fest.

2.0,Garbage,"I remember when this came out and I remember being bored even back than. Bad acting, with a bad plot, followed up with bad action sequences. This is the kind of movie 10 year olds love to brag that they've seen because it was pg-13. How this spawned so many sequels I will never know.",acnine,2022-03-17,2022
5.0,The Original Low Deck Kickstarter,"Ever since the release of The Fast and the Furious in the summer of 2001, the franchise has become one of Universal's biggest in recent years. With over 10 movies in its lineup and countless big names behind it, it's proven to be a marvel as far as down to earth street action flicks go. So how does the original one hold up?In the film, an undercover cop named Brian O'Connor is tasked with discovering the identities of a group of automobile hijackers led by Dominic Toretto. From that premise alone, the general plotline is fairly predictable and goes for a similar theme of family we've seen in other action dramas. However, what the movie does offer outside of its routine premise is its testosterone. Given how pumped up audiences must have been back then, one's adrenaline could immediately rise with all the fast cars, tough men, ferocious women and Vin Diesel. Anyone who has risked motor law to just let out their inner road demon with friends could relate to the muscle bound ferocity shown on screen.As for the late Paul Walker, even though one might expect him to have a cold heart as Brian, his chemistry with the low charismatic Diesel allows for some genuine emotion to come out of an otherwise brainless street action flick. While the other people in his family vary from temper to temper, the heart of it all remains Dom and his sister Mia, Brian's tight fisted albeit tender love interest. With all the struggles Brian has to maintain undercover, this would have to be the more heartbreaking aspect all around, yet the movie never forgets to make up in thrills and gut wrenching drama.So if you're more into the street racing than the film's attempts at human interaction, than the original Fast & the Furious does what it needs to do best: put you into a world where commercialized motor vehicles are like demons on a long road. If the franchise has gone on this long being more balls than brain, why stop now?",elicopperman,2022-03-18,2022
7.0,Very energetic and exciting,"I'd seen all of the Fast movies from five onward and always enjoyed them, so thought it was about time I watched the early instalments, and I was pleasantly surprised.This is much smaller in scale and ludicrousness compared to the later films and is all the better for it.The story is reminiscent of Point Break (swap the trucks for banks and the cars for surfing and you end up with a similar story), but is very enjoyable and thrilling.Some of the direction feels very dated, and the blurry and shaky camera work is awful, but there is some solid work in the film too.The performances are pretty solid. That doesn't really matter though, as they become so iconic and its fun to look back on them having seen the later films in the franchise.A very solid and enjoyable film, with a decent plot and energetic film making. Not amazing but very fun.",ethanbresnett,2022-03-25,2022
4.0,"Hit the brakes, this ride is awful","""The Fast and the Furious"" was never my cup of tea; not in '01 and not today. I do admire the purity of its sales pitch - fast cars and hot babes - but my problem is that the film takes itself way too seriously given the subject matter.Hoo boy, some of the dialogue in this movie; along with the frenzied editing of the racing scenes (I'm guessing they were going for ""supercharged""), it is unbelievably cringe. It's like there's a decent movie in here somewhere, but it just needed to go full camp and avoid the dramatic elements. They do not work.Maybe it's what they did to that Charger that was so offensive. By that point, I guess I'd had more than enough. I would definitely argue that this is an outstanding time capsule of the nascent '00s, with all of the music styles and fashion that that entails (yikes), but I just want to watch Point Break instead.",Mr-Fusion,2022-04-12,2022
6.0,I live my life a quarter of a mile at a time....,"Street racer Dominic Toretto falls under the suspicion of the LAPD for a string of high-speed electronics truck robberies.

Brian O'Connor, an officer of the LAPD, joins the ranks of Toretto's highly skilled racing crew undercover to convict Toretto.

However, O'Connor finds himself both enamoured with this new world and in love with Toretto's sister, Mia.

As a rival racing crew gains strength, O'Connor must decide where his loyalties lie.

Who would have thought twenty one years later that not only would this series still exist, but the fact that this franchise is one of the biggest of all time.

This was back in the day when Dominic and his gang were stealing DVD players, VCR's, and Camcorders. Now they go into space....

But as a stand alone film, it's a pretty ordinary film, basically copying the plot of the far superior 'Point Break', and ticking all the boxes that these narratives run by.

You know by the final act all will be well, Brian and Dominic will become best buddies, Mia and Brian will have Dominic's blessings, and all will have fun and drink Corona's.

Fun, pretty solid action, and Walker and Diesel have great chemistry together. It's such a shame that it's a pretty ordinary film.

3.0,how is this a classic,"This movie screams boring and generic. In middle school it seemed you HAD to see this movie how good it was. Sure what was like it out at the time but still it's such a boring movie that had some potential.The story starts off by some over the top ""jacking"" of some truck that goes successful. They are in LA back when LA was much more enjoyable to live in. Where as now I wouldn't want to go to California if they paid me.Paul looks kind of out of place. His hair makes him look like some sort of Backstreet Boy reject. The first little while he looks more interested sexually in Vin who they do that thing where you don't see Vin's face for the first few scenes to add dramaticism. I don't know Vin didn't seem right for the movie. He has the look but two things he's too short and of course he can't act to save his life. His chemistry with Paul near the end works but at first almost everyone is so one dimensional in this movie that it's just a chore to go through.The cars look like some 14 year old playing Need For Speed or Midnight Club games first creations.I wonder if Ja Rule regrets being in this movieAt least there's a car explosion or two in this with an over the top use of an uzi which I am honestly wondering if a single magazine can do that to a car.The soundtrack for the movie sucks, it feels like twisted metal 3 which with only a few exceptions such as ""keep rolling"" the odd DMX and Ja Rule song for the most part I'm scratching my head wondering who they are. It's like some suburban kids iPod or whatever was on some burnt CD back when Kazaa was a thing they used. It goes from hip hop, metal to a bit of techno and the songs are so poorly placed at times.Every car relies on nitro near the end of the race. Yet I swear there was a scene saying only people who can't race good use nitro.The pacing of the movie needed some serious work for this to deserve the praise it does. Although the ending worked and the bad guy was pretty boring without ruining anything in this movie with over 1000 reviews for a 20+ year old movie which is an accomplishment as we can count how many movies we forgot or not gave a crap about since then.",talllwoood13,2022-05-28,2022
3.0,It's okay,"The racing is a bunch of cars going in a straight line, without much in the way of impressive driving from the characters, but I guess there's not much you really can do to make straight line racing seem impressive. They do make an effort to make it colorful and entertaining, but that leads them to make every car related point of suspense during the race sequences comically unrealistic. It's funny, but not something that caters to my interest in cars.The plot is good, but that's because this movie's plot doesn't belong to this movie. The pacing, structure, and events are all the exact same as Point Break, the only difference being that they cut 15 minutes out of the climax.So, if you're like me and you don't think Tanner pressing the accelerator in his automatic Civic SI after a long day of selling weed to highschoolers is actual racing, then all this movie leaves you with is Point Break but with cars, bad music, worse actors, and worse cinematography. This movie sucks.",Pokyt,2022-06-21,2022
7.0,Back to simpler times.,"Really brings back to the time when the franchise was not as exaggerated. Despite being cheesy and cliche at times, this movie holds as one of my personal favourites. The plot is simple yet efficiently works. However, the ending felt rushed and anticlimatic to be fair, even with its intense build up. The perfomances are, god moly. Surprised when Vin Diesel went all out in this one, and the rest of the casts perfomances especially Paul Walker, are actually pretty decent and their chemistry makes this movie really fun to watch. It also has cool cars, great action scenes, probably one of the best scores in the franchise, and a lot of hot babes too, I mean I don't know what else to say anymore, so yeah, go for it.",rimuruu,2022-10-20,2022

Ends up finding out they truly were the bad guys, even has his chance to blow their whole gang out of the water and haul them in, but can't, because he cant betray his new found family, even blows his cover in the end.

10.0,Fast and Furious,"The movie franchise ""Fast and Furious"", now famous all over the world, it's scary to believe, started with the 2001 film, which translates from the original as ""Fast and Furious"". And it makes sense. The two main characters, played by Paul Walker and Vin Diesel, appear: one as fast, the other as furious racers. In our country, this work was translated and simplified to ""Fast and Furious"". The name is loud and memorable. Now you can't get used to anything else. But then, in 2001, the film became something fresh and exciting, interesting and loud. It was then, it remains to this day.The picture was directed by the famous director Rob Cohen, whom I personally remember from such films as ""Daylight"" with Sylvester Stallone and ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"" with Jason Scott Lee. The director took a new peak for himself, putting all his talent into a gasoline action movie, where elements of thriller and drama were successfully combined.The picture will delight the audience with excellent plans, plot, good acting. Everything here is successfully combined, turning the film into a well-coordinated seamless story that is limited in time and at the same time rapid in its development. The screenwriters worked hard, giving charismatic characters who became such on the screen thanks to the excellent performance of the actors. Which is remarkable. Almost every hero of the film is still remembered. If the subsequent pictures are mixed in the head with each other, then the first film and its characters are definitely remembered. There is a brave guy - an undercover cop Brian O'Connor, an excellent antihero performed by Vin Diesel Dominic Toretto. The story is built on their relationship. Other characters are also good, played by Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Matt Schulze, Rick Yun, Chad Lindberg. Coolly written characters come to life on the screen and look convincing on the screen.The intertwining of destinies allows each character to reveal himself. We sometimes see complicated relationships within one group of friends, even family. But all squabbles and resentments are necessarily outweighed by a sense of duty and responsibility for each other. And the relationship of young people takes this film to a new level. We will see love and betrayal, true friendship and hatred, dangerous meetings and compromises. This approach to the disclosure of the character turns ""Fast and Furious"" not just into an action movie, but makes the film a crime drama, where the degree of history will increase with each turn of the plot development.But ""Fast and Furious"" would not be it in the quality in which we understand it today, if there were not that wild drive of the streets soaked in neon and nitrous oxide at night. Young people hang out here, powerful motors rattle, music plays bass, their own life goes on. And the main thing is racing. A quarter of a mile, during which there are only heroes and their cars. It was this atmosphere that gave rise to a whole culture in computer games. Which is worth only one series of Need for Speed, which is alive (but according to many dead) so far. There were a lot of other attempts to repeat the success of ""Fast and Furious"" by other creators, but it seems to me that this series hardly has competitors, although the subsequent parts changed their focus, going one way or the other from street racing, but somehow returning to the origins.""Fast and Furious"" was and remains a good movie. He lit several stars at once, gave way to young actors, made them famous. This is a great project that has already passed the test of time. This is the first and probably the most soulful picture in the whole series. Great drama, high speeds, dynamic action and a sea of exciting emotions.10 out of 10.",alekspredator87,2022-10-27,2022
7.0,"Should Be Mediocre, But Has Something Special.","I decided to rewatch this entire franchise and of course that means starting from the beginning. I actually went to theaters to see this film and I remember this being a huge hit to my friends in high school.

Directed by Rob Cohen and written by Scott Thompson, Fast and Furious centers around an undercover police officer trying to find a group responsible for multiple semi-truck robberies. This leads him to a group of friends headed by an ex-convict, Dominic Toretto. The group takes part in illegal street races, which Brian (the officer) takes part in as well as part of his cover. Things become complicated when he becomes attracted to Dominic's sister, Mia.

Anyone who entered into this franchise through its more recent installments might be shocked to read how simplistic and non-action oriented this plot is. In fact, in terms of plots, this is probably the most basic (other than maybe the third film).

One of the positive elements about the story is its great focus on friendship and family. While that would eventually become overblown later in the series, this one feels far more natural in its depiction and not forced like the others.

With that said, the plot is not strong. The police investigation scenes feel more like they were written for a 1980s TV show than a movie set in 2001. In fact, the police storyline and the story of Dominic's family feel like two separate movies at times and don't feel cohesive, especially during Dominic's interrogation scene with Brian.

The story concerning Brian and his interaction with Dominic's family really is the heart of the movie and helps make up for the shortcomings in the overall story. It also helps that the racing scenes and car scenes are so well constructed and very entertaining. Granted, some of the dialogue for the car scenes is a bit weird. For instance, the scene when Dominic makes fun of Brian after the first race is some of the worst dialogue ever.

The acting is rather unique for this film. Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster are very good and have great chemistry. Vin Diesel goes up and down, some scenes are great and others are really off. Some performances are just downright bad. For instance, Michelle Rodriguez is just terrible in this. However, the unique element is this, while performances like that might be seen as a detriment, the chemistry of this cast is undeniable and easily make up for any subpar performances.

So overall, it's a movie that doesn't have a strong plot, not all of the performances are stellar but there's a charm to its presentation that keeps it undeniably entertaining.",Ggconte,2022-11-15,2022

Trying to leave the cinema carpark as soon as these films finish is a risk with all the young drivers thinking they're Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, indeed Paul Walker can be used as a cautionary tale.",ryan-shaw-627-316495,2023-02-04,2023
6.0,Would recommend,"2 fast 2 furious can be a bit of an uneven movie. While it's fair share of short comings, they are ultimately pretty easy to look over while watching this film. The fast cars and the enjoyable/likable cast make this movie a thrill to watch. Some of the lines are a little wacky and kinda childish but it's still pretty darn quotable even today. Overall, the movie will probably most enjoyable to an older crowd from around the time this came out and people who like cars/street racing. It's a good movie to put on with some friends and have a good time with its absurd action filled goodness. Would recommend.",tammiea-48100,2023-02-04,2023
8.0,It's Fast and Furious,Certainly a very fitting title. The movie does not waste any time getting started and continues on fast paced the entire way while also making you root for the characters. The story thrives less on its plot and more on the connection between Paul Walker and Vin Diesel. The secondary characters also fit in perfectly. Looking back this franchise was only made possible by the success of this character development.The scenes with the cops weren't particularly exciting but I suppose necessary to add an element of suspense of how Dom would react when he finds out Brian's identity.Despite its overall poor reviews from critics true fans know it's a classic.,ThereelscoopwithKK,2023-02-11,2023
5.0,Mostly made for Car people,"It was okay but I think it's more made for people who are into action and cars. I watched it and vin diesel was the only character I found interesting in the slightest, he played a really cool and somewhat interesting character and he was relatively funny. The story is pretty good and added slight Intensity and allowed the story to have more value than just an action flick but it still wasn't an overly special or deep story. The action was relatively cool but I personally couldn't really keep interest in it, honestly if you love the driving parts of the movie cars and you like gang type characters then I guess you'll love this. The final half an hour was really good though.",popyoshi-36312,2023-02-26,2023

8.0,Fun Movie With Plenty Of Action,"A fun movie that started a franchise.The story unfolds like an action crime story, and gives us a lot of action scenes and a solid plot. The plot is not complicated, but it doesn't need to be.It's the atmosphere and the characters that matter, and that's done pretty well.The movie is a real movie from the early 2000s that actually works like a 90s action crime movie. That's actually what makes it good because movies like that aren't pretentious, they don't teach us lessons, they're made to entertain us, and that's something The Fast and the Furious certainly succeeds.The cars in the movie are fantastic and anyone who likes fast cars and action will have something to see. They have built and tuned a bunch of cars and they are really fun to see.The stunts are excellent and well directed.Movies from the 90s and early 2000s have a distinct look and feel, and that makes them truly special.A fun, fast-paced movie that's definitely worth watching.",dk777,2023-03-20,2023
7.0,Street level 2000s,"It's been at least more than a decade since I watched this and this really feels like a standalone pulpy early 2000s movie that is cliched and entertaining. It was really street level and it's about stealing DVD players, who in their right mind could have ever thought where this franchise would end up! It works a lot like an exploitation movie, it got enough commentary and character depths to attract attention to it, but it is clearly contrived in a way that is safe and pleasing to anyone reading in whatever way they want. While some of it feels deeper than the surface-level stuff the bigger films in the franchise pull, some of it is shot stylistically to seem like it's saying something to tell the exact opposite. '
Nonetheless, it's an entertaining film that never stops the rush it has and anything added to it just makes it more appealing even if it is safe and half-assed to look more than it is. Vin Diesel was really perfect in this role with all the positives and negatives in the writing of the whole movie itself clearly reflected in the way he carries the role.",Jithindurden,2023-04-11,2023
7.0,"""I owe you a 10-second car.""","(520-word review) Film number one is in the bag; wow, there are NINE more.Everything about this was 2000s galore; the music, the outfits, the cars, the dialogue, the personalities of the characters, and the somewhat grainy/fuzzy cinematography. All of that adds to the charm, specifically the cinematography. The time-lapses and the nighttime cinematography were good.A nostalgia trip for most people, looking back. A combination of experiencing that time and this film back then. For me, it's more of an understanding (""Damn, a film that came out in 2001 is the epitome of 2000s pop culture"") than a feeling; frankly, some of it didn't land for me, particularly the constant blasting of music, both songs and the score.Throughout this film's duration, I wasn't feeling much of a story there; humble beginnings, given what the franchise develops into. You could say the same for those films, as far as not ""much of a story there"" is concerned, and that's probably accurate. More or less. Yet part of me feels the plots in those films are better. I NEED to hear the word 'family' in every line.Either way, the ramped-up outrageousness in those films likely makes up for it if that's not the case, whereas this one doesn't have that. The calm-before-the-storm/humble beginnings nature made the lackluster story stick out.The ""purpose"" behind it regarding Brian O'Conner (also, I already knew the plot twist concerning him, but I can't remember how) was lackluster; the ""real"" purpose of the overall film was undoubtedly the aesthetic. The cars and the racing: being ""cool."" And the developing camaraderie between him and Dominic Toretto, of course.In that vein, it was the best part, starting with the final heist: the development between them, especially everything after Dom learns the truth and Brian immediately goes to his place; that scene with them was well-acted by Vin Diesel and Paul Walker.That's also when the film began moving along, picking up steam. Becoming more enjoyable, as up to that point was less so. That includes the romantic angle with Brian and Mia, which was 'there.' Nothing more, nothing less. There wasn't much focus on it anyway, for some reason, and it wouldn't have made a difference if it wasn't there.My main criticism was Paul Walker's acting (although he was good-looking: his hair, in particular). While writing this, I have no idea whether people have said/are saying anything about it, particularly in this way. But yeah. His acting was mediocre until the scene with Brian and Dom at Dom's house after the final heist; his and Vin Diesel's acting in that scene was their best in the film.Acting-wise, Chad Lindberg (Jesse) was up there with Vin, and there should've been more of him. Bars. He even resembled Aaron Paul. Or not. It was more so the vibe and personality of the character that made me think of that comparison. Chad (Jesse) could've played Jesse Pinkman.As a film that's pure 2000s style and aesthetic from the music to the clothing, the Brian-Dom camaraderie held it up, complimented by the charm and action sequences.",LegendaryFang56,2023-04-19,2023
8.0,"Not the best, but pretty great start","The Fast and the Furious has been established as one of the most popular and ambitious movie franchises in history - showcasing a memorable cast of characters, astonishing action set pieces and a fun lighthearted tone, it is rivaled perhaps only by the MCU or Star Wars as one of the most long lived and continuingly solid series.Admittedly, it gets far better in the later installments, with action scenes and effects that could only have been dreamed of - but this initial entry was a very solid start regardless.It isn't a very story driven piece, and it doesn't set out to be (though later films focused a bit more on that), yet it's very fun and memorable, and gives great motivation to the suspenseful and fast paced action scenes.Overall, a great film with incredible effects and cinematography that started out a very fun franchise. Just don't take it all too seriously!",martinpersson97,2023-04-20,2023
7.0,The film that started it all,"The Fast and Furious is a massive franchise and includes many films and big names. This is not a bad film. It keeps you quite tuned in from start to finish with some great action scenes, street racing and big personalities. We see these big personalities face off and collide. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker do a good job carrying this film. Dom (Diesel) is tough and not to be trifled with. Paul Walker walks a fine line to win his trust and learn his operation.This film is an adrenaline rush. You have action, adventure, street racing and a alright story that pulls it together. You can't help but tune in to see how it all ends. These films are meant to be easy to understand and entertaining. 7/10.",Kingslaay,2023-04-29,2023

7.0,It's kind of what you expect...kind of.,"My friends wanted me to check this out since they're about to see Fast X. Now I got to watch all of them which I might enjoy. The only things in this movie I wasn't a fan of was the acting (which was fair at BEST) and some of the distractions in the plot (like with the police, crime element, etc). Sometimes it focused too much on that instead of the cars, racing, and action which is why someone would watch a movie like this I assume? There were 3 or 4 really good scenes with those things that saved the movie for me. Overall kind of a mixed bag for a first installment but hopefully I'll end up liking the sequels more with the more modern it gets and higher the stakes with the characters as time goes on.",SPZMaxinema,2023-05-26,2023
7.0,Time to race!,"Review: it's a pretty good movie with a good story and great likeable cast such as Paul Walker and Vin Diesel. If you like racing, drama heist action movies, then this is for you.

Takeaways:

-The Original is great and works flawlessly as a standalone, because it is Story driven and not racing or action driven. (As the sequels all were)

-Vin Diesel Paul Walker Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster are perfectly cast and they all compliment each other well.

-Vin Diesel plays Street Racer/expert thief Dominic ""Dom"" Torretto while Paul Walker plays Undercover Cop Brian O Connor, who is sent to spy on and arrest Dom after earning his trust. However things get complicated for Brian when he ends up falling in love with Don's Sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) as well as Brian forming a friendship with Dom. Brian struggles with the fact that he will have to throw away his new relationships in order for him to complete his job.

Michelle Rodriguez is also enjoyable to watch as Don's girlfriend/Partner in crime, Leticia ""Letty"" Ortiz. Their Bonnie and Clyde chemistry was perfect.

The cinematography was great and I love the sunset scenes and ""summertime"" vibes.

The Cars were great. I love Brian's car and Don's Dodge Charger. They were the best.

Conclusion: it's a good ""Small story"" movie, that of course lead to many many Sequels. The Fast and The Furious became a blockbuster film franchise afterwards, and this was just the start.",myblueblazer,2023-05-29,2023
8.0,I love hot cars and testosterone...this is the film that launched a franchise.,"This film was fantastic back in the day and it still seems to hold up to the test of time. This was one of those action packed summer films that got everyone excited and eventually launched a whole fast and furious franchise.The story begins with an undercover cop trying to break in to a tight knit crew of street racers who are pulling high speed heists of semi-trucks on the California freeway system and being lead by the tough but principled Dominic Toretto (played by Vin Diesel). Our undercover cop Brian (played by the now deceased Paul Walker) must first win Don's respect. The two eventually develop mutual respect and as we get to know Dom's whole crew Letty, the only girl and Dom's old lady, Jesse who is brilliant but ADHD has really prevented him from excelling at school, Vince who is a hot head but known Dom the longest...and Leon who is the most underdeveloped but stable character in the group. Then there is Mia, Dom's younger and much more attractive sister...who also catches Brian's eyes.This is less of a cat and mouse and more of a love letter to racing...and a life of speed. I appreciated the elaborate thefts and the joint taskforce's difficulties in finding the real culprits before the truck drivers start their own vigilante justice.This is and was a great film. If you are at all interested in an action adventure film built around cars and honor among thieves...this is the film for you.It has a decent soundtrack, a decent romance, great cars, decent heist story, but what sets this film apart is the camaraderie of the crew and the mutual respect between Dom and Brian. Very testosterone heavy...but I for one liked it.",cgvsluis,2023-05-29,2023
10.0,The Best of the Series,"For those who were alive and conscious when this film came out, know how special it was. Now, in 2023, with the new film coming out and them already having visited space in F9 (lmfao), this one becomes even more of a treasure simply because it is REALISTIC. The heart, the story, the characters, the plot twist - we actually related to all those things and felt for the characters. The films after that are contrived and superficial.This is where it all began and this is where the heart of the series will always remain. To the younger audience it may seem corny and of poor quality compared to the CGI used in the subsequent films, but what's grounding here is that most action/car blow ups/car wreck scenes are real, and it takes a true film buff to appreciate that.This movie is more than just an action flick, it is the birth of a family that Dom always talks about. It's nostalgic. It's heroic. It's a gem.",ap-40139-19855,2023-05-29,2023
7.0,'Corona'-Virus,"I've a couple of reasons for revisiting the ""F&TF"" franchise at the moment. There's a tenth film in cinemas now, so I could do with the refresher, but also the ""How Did This Get Made"" podcast is covering them, and I try to watch the films along with them whenever I can. Though it's showing it's age in a couple of places it was actually reasonably enjoyable.Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) is an undercover police officer who infiltrates a team involved in illegal LA Street racing to try and find out who is behind a series of highly skilled thefts from trucks, whilst they are in motion. He infiltrates the team led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) but he doesn't believe that he is behind the crime, his vision though is clouded by an attraction to Toretto's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster).I was surprised about how much I actually enjoyed this. It's hilariously basic, compared to where the series ends up. Essentially, it's about stealing dvd players, that's how old the film in. There are no international terrorists, cagey CIA agents with unlimited budgets, or trips to space. There's some street racing, there's a reasonably well-planned heist and there's quite a bit of what looks like practical stunts. I was surprised about how much acting Vin Diesel does at this point in the franchise, he's warm and reasonable and doesn't just monosyllabically mumble the word ""Family"" every few minutes.It's really quite homophobic though and uses some terms that are absolutely unacceptable now. The portrayal of women is very much 'of the time', they are at best motivations for the actions and at worst literal prizes to be won or lost. The ending is a bit weak, and you wonder if they already had half an eye on the sequels by not arriving at a more definitive resolution for either of the main characters.I know there are much more exciting films to come in this franchise and a bit of a dip to come first, but I was surprised about just how watchable this one was.",southdavid,2023-06-04,2023
6.0,Back in simpler times,"This one reminded me of when the Fast and Furious franchise used to be synonymous with racing, when the makers were more concerned with automobiles and the engineering that goes into them than with staging a variety of fast-paced, nonsensical action set pieces.The narratives at that point in time used to be routine though, not much emphasis were given but they had these characters who seemed relevant and to whom one could relate, as opposed to the present scenario where everyone is treated as if they have superpowers.While I adore (to a certain extent) these updated over-the-top world-saving notions, this is not what F&F was set up for. I think that the creators need to go back to their roots, their origins, I feel that's the only path left to redeem themselves as well as this series.",SoumikBanerjee1996,2023-06-09,2023
7.0,Unintentionally good for a laugh,"I rated this a 7 because I saw it in theaters when I was a teenager and it was pretty much the coolest thing ever and made for some good memories with friends. After having rewatched it recently I realized how dumb and immature I must have been back then. Decided to write my first review ever.The movie is visually great, good looking actors, cool cars for the time, most would say really hot girls although personally I only thought Mia was attractive. Music was good, cinematography was great, minus the few shakey camera race scenes. It had just enough action scenes to keep you interested and engaged.Now for the bad.. Acting and dialogue was atrocious, literally the cheesiest 1 liners i've ever heard in any movie ever, and its non stop throughout the whole movie. Vin diesel was okay considering what the actors had to work with. I Can't really think of a lead besides paul walker that would have made the movie any better, that being said he was terribly bad.(RIP) Chasing down Big Rigs with honda civics, jumping onto moving semi trucks going 70 mph makes absolutely no sense, Im sure they could have thought of an easier way to hijack the trucks, but they had to make it cool right? Paul Walker was literally the worst person ever to cast as an undercover cop, Michelle rodriguez was cringe and annoying to look at with a permanent scowl on her face trying to be more badass than vin diesel. Vince literally called Brian a Buster at one point, and I could literally go on forever with just how cheesy the movie is, dont even get me started on all the over the top unrealistic Car/Racing stuff. I just think the movie tried to take itself way too serious..Overall the movie is a good mindless watch, it really does make you laugh out loud even though its not trying to and even though the rest of the movies suck, this one however silly is an iconic film that won't be forgotten.",mikeyyo_,2023-08-05,2023
10.0,Nostalgic,"I give this movie a 10 out of 10 not because it's perfect, because it isn't, to me this movie is a 10 simply because it is a movie that I can enjoy and rewatch several times without feeling bored. The fast and furious series was is a series that my father really loved and so I ended up really loving it too. It might just be the nostalgia but to me this movie is perfect even though it isn't. Also, I feel like the series kinda went off the track in later movies but in this one, it really is just about cars and cool stuff.Rest in peace Paul Walker. My younger brother is named after Brian because my dad discover the franchise when my little brother was born.",jasoncrespo-56276,2023-08-08,2023
8.0,N1,"""Fast and Furious 1"" represents one of the turning points of modern action cinema with its adrenaline-fueled scenes, captivating storyline, and unforgettable characters. The film splendidly presents viewers with the passion for speed, friendship, and family bonds.The charisma of Vin Diesel and the attractiveness of Paul Walker are among the crucial factors that connect the audience with the characters. Scenes featuring car races and perilous missions elevate the tension to the highest level, while the film's music impeccably supports these moments.However, the presence of certain clichÃ©s and predictable elements in the film stands out as a weakness in terms of originality. More emphasis could be placed on character development, and certain dialogues could have been deeper. Moreover, by providing more information about the backgrounds of various characters, the universe of the film could be further enriched.In conclusion, ""Fast and Furious 1"" offers action enthusiasts a gratifying experience with its action-packed scenes and characters. Nevertheless, addressing the clichÃ©s and deficiencies in character development could be considered to thoroughly refine the film.",uhudsavascisi,2023-08-17,2023
6.0,Better than I was expecting it to be?,"It wasn't very good, but it wasn't all that bad either. By the end I found myself...half caring about the characters, so I'm giving it a 6 instead of a 5.I watched this because I'm sick and not really able to concentrate on much and we figured this would take very little brain power. It maybe took a little bit of brain power to believe anyone was making any of the decisions anyone made in this movie.I wondered if street races are a real thing and it turns out it's based on a news article, so I guess it is a real thing!The second thing this film made me wonder is how often people in LA can't get to work on time cuz streets are closed to film car chases.I...feel compelled to watch the rest of the series as I don't understand what could happen next.",kyla-72302,2023-08-30,2023
6.0,The Fast and the Furious,"To be honest, the thin plot doesn't really matter here. This is just a good excuse for some fit people who look great to race souped-up production cars at break-neck speed around Los Angeles. Eye-candy Paul Walker (""Brian"") and hardened ""Dom"" (Vin Diesel) look like they are truly pumped up for their roles and given neither have much by the way of dialogue to remember, they just get on with it. The soundtrack is irritating but the production and stunt work match the high octane pace of the film with some seriously innovative action photography and loads of squealing tyres - and I quite enjoyed it.",CinemaSerf,2023-09-02,2023
10.0,Better than the last 5,"I wanted to see it and I cannot believe that it has been 22 years since. I remember when I watched it the first time, after that the Need for Speed put out ""Underground"" changing the race gaming industry completely. For my generation, those were REALLY good times: Nu metal, tuned cars race games, internet, Corona ðŸ˜‚.I was very disappointed at their last installment Fast X. The amount of BS special effects and CGI. I don't want to make comparisons (because the intention was not the same) but this is a bit like comparing the masterpiece ""Jurassic Park"" of Spielberg to JW: Dominion. But that's what you get when you change the subject, or worse forget it, because you want to make it about saving the world.Anyway! The point is: this movie is a historical piece of my generation, like a lot of other things I mentioned. Like some other reviewers wrote, don't try get deep in the thin plot, but understand the importance and the impact it made for young highschoolers and their (my) generation.PS. The Skyline GTR R34 (2 Fast, 2 Furious and NFS: Underground) became one of my Top 5 legendary cars.",ronzille,2023-09-21,2023
7.0,Fast And Furious,"The plot of this film is actually blunt and simple in logic, without all the thrills and twists in ordinary police movies. While performing an undercover mission, Brian fell in love with Dom's sister, and was also infected by Dom's personality charm. In the end, he solved the case but let him go, which was a very reasonable and natural ending. Although the plot is ordinary, by interspersing various racing elements, the whole film is still very fresh and watchable, giving the audience a brand new concept of speed.This film has given us too many interpretations of racing, passion, and friendship. It is obviously very exciting and fresh, but it also conveys some very traditional and warm concepts, and it has well established the plot, background and identity of the characters.",y-65186-04270,2023-09-25,2023
5.0,"It's decent at first, but becomes repetitive and the paper thin story does it no favours either","Brian O'Conner is sent undercover to investigate Dominic Toretto and his crew of street racers (who are seemingly involved in numerous thefts of electronic goods from trucks). However, the glamour of street racing and being smitten with Toretto's sister Mia puts O'Conner in a quandary, meaning, at times, he's never quite sure with whom his loyalties truly lie...I've lost touch with this franchise over the years I think the last one I watched may have been the 6th film in the franchise so I've decided to try and watch them one by one from the start and although this first film is touted as one of the best I have to admit to finding it slightly disappointing.There is a story here, but its so thin and practically inconsequential that it really isn't worth discussing or expanding on in any further detail so I'll concentrate on other areas within the film...The acting is hardly oscar worthy, but I felt that the cast did reasonably well with what little that they had to work with; Vin Diesel is hardly the best of actors, but his gruff persona suits the material well and he comes off as being surprisingly watchable here. The late Paul Walker has never been an amazing actor, but again did OK with what he was served up with here. Rodriguez was a ballsy girl and put on a fairly good show, but Brewster was a bit bland (then again hardly her fault when character development was so weak here). A few of the other performers were little more than weak ethnic stereotypes who I couldn't help but feel deserved better.Still where the film works best is in the chase sequences and the racing; at least these scenes are entertaining and provide the film with that much needed injection of pace - TF&TF really suffers when any kind of narrative comes in to play.I watched this film at the cinema when it was released as a very young 19 year old man. My 19 year old self was highly impressed with the film; the chases, the action, the high-octane stuff and the hot girls were enough to effectively blow me away the first time I watched this film. As a man in my early 40's now I need more than that; whilst I have no complaints with what impressed me as a 19 year old; heck these things are still good!! Nowadays I see these things as a compliment and a decent story is needed to flesh out what is otherwise a superficial and inconsequential film which is sadly what TF&TF is when you take away all the gloss and polish.I don't regret watching it again and will persevere with the franchise, but it's fair to say that this is probably one of those franchises that is likely to appeal much more to the younger crowd and much less to those, who like me, are sadly now just about creeping in to middle age.",jimbo-53-186511,2023-09-26,2023
8.0,The car movie that started a trend and paved the way for so many other movies,"This movie is so memorable and holds a nostalgic place in my heart. It's got such a cool and slick style. And the stunts are off the charts - they're actually impressive. A lot of the dialogue can come off pretty corny and cheesy, but it just adds to the overall charm of the movie. This movie started a whole trend with hooking up cars and that alone deserves praise. Such an iconic movie that paved the way for so many others. The soundtrack slaps and the story is actually decent. I swear though, half of the female extras in this movie are either strippers or mattress actresses lol. And that's not necessarily a bad thing.Overall, it's a really solid movie that's a lot of fun to watch that's equal parts thrilling and exciting. Rewatching this movie for the 3rd time, I couldn't help but have the biggest smile on my face.",Kysugo,2023-10-04,2023
10.0,A High-Octane Masterpiece,"Buckle up, because ""The Fast and the Furious"" is a high-octane joyride that will leave you breathless from start to finish. This 2001 cinematic gem, directed by Rob Cohen, is not just a movie; it's a pulse-pounding adrenaline rush that defined a generation of action films. From the screeching tires to the heart-stopping races, this film takes you on a thrilling journey through the underground world of street racing in Los Angeles.One of the strongest aspects of this film is its gripping storyline. The narrative is tightly woven, keeping the audience engaged right from the opening scene. The characters are well-developed, each with their unique personalities and motivations, adding depth to the overall story. Moreover, the film expertly explores themes of loyalty, friendship, and the blurred lines between right and wrong, making it more than just a typical action movie.The races in this film are nothing short of spectacular.

6.0,GREAT START AHEAD OF THE FRANCHISE,"What I liked most about this movie was the beautiful story and background given to Paul Walker's character. His performance was just good, and his persona seemed like the perfect one for that role. The director was smart in acknowledging the fact that there needed to be a balance of ""fast and furious"" as well as slowness and really taking the time to provide a good story arch and giving justice to the characters portrayed. In my opinion, Vin Diesel's performance was better because it gave more conviction than Paul Walker's. But the action and chase scenes were to die for, and it set the perfect tone for the subsequent films in the franchise.",jeromesgabilo,2023-12-15,2023
7.0,The Fast and the Furious (2001) When everything was simpler,"The first film in the Fast and Furious franchise is much simpler than the later ones. Here, the film focuses on something much less megalomaniacal and seeks to explore only street racing. The simplicity of the script is what makes this first film good. As much as the script is flawed when it comes to the police investigation, this doesn't sound like a problem. At no point does the film propose to be an investigation like Se7en. The focus here is entirely on the action. The setting makes the FBI plot consistent with the rest of the story. At no point does the film require an Oscar-worthy performance from the characters, so Vin Diesel and Paul Walker manage to deliver a good job, precisely because they are just charismatic and get along well. The first film in the franchise is good for not trying to be more than it is. He does what he sets out to do and does it effectively.",claszdsburrogato,2024-01-06,2024
8.0,A piece of culture,"This movie is entertaining and it has something that went missing as the franchise expanded (lost it from the 4th movie onwards): culture.All characters in this movie feel real, they are cool in their own way and have interesting personalities. They all share the same passion for high speed, car parts and imported models.This is what makes this movie culturally important, there are many heist movies but this is the only one that has such an emphasis on cars and speed.It is aestethically relevant for the beauty of the cars, the style of the characters and the music. It depicts a world that would have been fun to be part of, a celebration of youth!",Meneziade,2024-01-07,2024
7.0,Cliched but entertaining - Point Break with cars!,"It's like Point Break, but with cars rather than surfboards, and oodles more Vin Diesel.

The plot is generic: undercover police officer ends up falling in love with someone involved in the crime he is investigating, leading to the inevitable showdown.

Give producers their due: the entire movie is flashily executed. Makes up for the often tortured dialogue. Fair to say, the script won't be winning any Academy Awards soon.

Paul Walker is said police officer in this movie, Brian O'Conner, an LAPD cop sent undercover to bust Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel, in the role that made him a fortune thanks to the still-continuing franchise) and who ends up falling in love with Dominic's sister, Mia, played by Jordana Brewster.

There are truck robbery heists, rival gangs (led by the always-sinister Rick Yune), illegal street drag races, and even a few bullets flying about the place. Add in a vibrant soundtrack and spectacular if credulity-stretching action sequences and you have a winner.",allmoviesfan,2024-01-11,2024
6.0,Style Over Substance Only Gets You So Far,"Pretty cars, pretty people, loud music, lots of stunts fights and races. The performances are ok if fairly limited in range and the dialog swings from adequate to embarrassing.If this is all your looking for in your cinematic experience it can certainly be entertaining. But I would prefer less cliches and some actual character development.The writing is pretty straightforward, and cliched, and the plot is far from original - though it does admittedly have a little more style and attitude.The big racing event which the characters attend is unfortunately named race wars.Obviously despite its shortcomings the film made over $200 Million and spawned a franchise - so what do know.",gpeevers,2024-02-13,2024
10.0,Worth the watch!,I give this a 10/10 because the graphics the acting and the action was amazing! Iv watched this film at least 15 times! I think this film is suitable for over 15s that love cars. In my opinion the best part is the dodge vs Mk4 supra race at the end. It was based in america in the 2000 were they do street racing that is illegal and the cops come and try to stop them. Brian in a cop but he loves to street race and he becomes friend s with Dom Torretto . Mia who is Doms sister sees something she likes in Brain. One day Dom finds out that Brian is a cob and isant happy with him but still frinds with him.,greenalfie-73336,2024-02-13,2024
8.0,From the times when physics were still a thing in the fast & fruious series...,"Just finished watching it again... Awesome! I wonder why this movie doesn't have a better rating... Really it's awesome, it's the reason why there have been 9+ other Fast & Furious Movies added to the series! But to be honest this one is really by far the best and I also like that this one is from the times when Fast & Furious wasn't fames for riduculously unrealistic stunts and physics that are a joke. Truly the new ones are so overdone, especially because of the physics... But this one! This one nails it in so many ways and it feels so mach better watching it! If somebody still hasn't watched it - I highly recommend you do so!",arcelivez-753-983928,2024-02-22,2024
7.0,A classic!,"""The Fast and the Furious"" (2001) is a thrilling ride into the world of underground street racing. Set against the backdrop of Los Angeles, it merges the raw energy of the early 2000s with the burgeoning car culture of the millennium. The movie's heart lies in its iconic cars, which are not just vehicles, but symbols of freedom, power, and identity. As the first installment of a now legendary franchise, it establishes a world where loyalty, honor, and the thrill of the race reign supreme. Its authenticity in portraying street racing culture, combined with a compelling storyline and memorable characters, cements its status as a classic. The film captures the essence of an era, making it a timeless ode to speed, style, and the spirit of rebellion.",schmittfalte,2024-02-25,2024
9.0,The First Film of the Beginning of an Era,"""The Fast and the Furious 1"" is a film that satisfies enthusiasts of action and speed. The performances of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are among the elements that make the film exciting. However, it falls short in terms of screenplay and character depth. The story generally progresses in a clichÃ©d and predictable manner. The dialogues also feel somewhat artificial and shallow. Nevertheless, with its intense action scenes and visual effects, it manages to captivate the audience. While the film provides an enjoyable spectacle for fans of speed and adrenaline, it may lack depth for those seeking more substance. I watched it at least 3 times before and I never got bored.",alperyilmaz-32702,2024-02-29,2024
8.0,GOOD MOVIE,"Fast and Furious accelerates into the action genre with roaring engines and gripping stunts. Vin Diesel's magnetic presence and Paul Walker's charm create a dynamic duo, carrying the film through its occasional predictable moments. The cinematography captures the speed demons' world, immersing the audience in a visceral experience. The soundtrack, pulsating with energy, enhances the adrenaline rush. While the plot may lack complexity, the film compensates with sheer entertainment value. A classic in the franchise, it laid the foundation for future entries. Fast and Furious secures its 8/10 rating by embracing its identity as a high-octane spectacle, leaving audiences revved up for more.",adem2520,2024-03-10,2024
9.0,This Is a very good Entertainment Movie,"When you wanna be relaxing or when you pay a theater ticket you expect an entertainment movie and this first movie of the long saga of Fast and Furious lived up to my expectations !!!!The story telling is pretty nice and interesting, you wanna find out more about them, like more the past of Brian and Dominic, the actions scenes are amazing and really crazy I wondering how they can do making this movie with of barely 38 million is nothing of all great action scene.They got very managed the fact of mixing car racing and privacy life in the script, some scene are laugh too, the shoots of LA are beautiful and last 25 minutes are crazy and fun especially for action movie fan !I'm so exiting to discover the next stage of the franchise. If you want an entertainment movie is all good Go on !!!!!",tomlaju,2024-04-10,2024
4.0,"As a series newcomer watching for the first time in 2024, I found this surprisingly boring.","For some of this movie's runtime, I found it kind of charming, but it got really tedious at a point. I hope Vin Diesel and Paul Walker get better as the series goes on - both gave kind of awful lead performances here.It probably doesn't help that I find cars boring and street racing stupid. That should be enough to turn me away from a series like Fast and Furious, and it has for 20+ years... but I'm fascinated by the way the series as a whole started small and morphed into something else. It's a progression I want to experience, but starting off with this first movie (as one has to do)... it was rough!The racing scenes are pretty boring, the performances are sometimes pretty bad, and the narrative is a dull kind of ""undercover cop falls for the people he's supposed to take down"" thing that's been done before and done better.Sign me up for the more over-the-top entries that verge away from racing. I think I'll enjoy them more (I saw Fast Five years ago and found it better than this... the only other movie from the series I've seen in isolation is Tokyo Drift, and I remember finding that one more watchable too).So, the original The Fast and the Furious... it's not for me, but I am keen to keep chipping away at this series, because it's been a pop culture blindspot for me for too long. The start of it all proved to be surprisingly lame and boring though, in my opinion.",Jeremy_Urquhart,2024-05-03,2024
9.0,"""It doesn't matter if you win by an inch or a kilometer, the important thing is to win!""","""The Fast and the Furious"" is a great opening film. A crazy movie full of moments that get you pumping. The idea of street racing is so cool! The introduction of what is currently one of the most iconic franchises in the history of cinema is really well made. They have very well introduced the plot of the saga, the characters are fantastic and I love them to madness, especially now that I have seen these films so many times that I know them by heart. Dominic is a badass and I get so excited and played by Vin Diesel is literally an iconic god of cinema. But Brian is my favorite character and I think it's influenced by the presence of Paul Walker, who I love so much. I loved Mia, Letty, Jesse, Vince and the others, too. I liked the fact of inserting a short plot with a simple and therefore excellent writing, so as to give maximum minutage to the automotive action scenes, the true essence of the film. Cohen's direction is good, and so is photography. The rhythm is almost excellent, you will not get bored practically ever, especially for the choice not to last even this saga an infinity of unnecessary hours but to make the visions pleasant and smooth. The music is great and intersects perfectly with the plot and the setting is also great. The costumes are perfect for the film and I especially love Toretto's ouftit. The ending of the film is great. One thing not to be underestimated and that makes the film even more beautiful is the presence of fabulous machines with aesthetics out of the ordinary. After this vision I reassessed the film even more positively, now I really know it by heart, but from how much I enjoy this saga, each time I will watch it as if it were the first..

5.0,Mediocre at best,"I'm watching the whole series (I only saw 1 and 2 when younger). I liked it for what it was when I was 15 or something, but even then I knew it wasn't particularly good.Besides the awful acting and mediocre at best dialogue, I have to say It was good (just that, good) for a while. All the set-up was fun, even if dumb of course, and the 2nd act was good, creating tension for Paul Walker's character.And then... they dropped the ball. They made a scene that could've cut a lot of boring minutes of this movie, and justify the ending at the same time and yet they keep going, wasting all the tension just to have a stupid last motivation for the characters to be where the writers wanted them to be. All this in pursuit of an unnecessary and overlong ""Hollywood"" 3rd act that deflated it for me. Overall, I think it's ok for what it was trying to do.",eddmurua,2024-05-17,2024
7.0,Best watched a quarter mile at a time.,"The Fast and the Furious is a car culture movie that created an action cinematic universe. So many meme lines and amazing car action are packed into this pre-9/11, Y2K time capsule. It's always fun to see where the Fast Franchise began and the birth of series staples, back when Dom still appeared mortal.Point Break with cars is NOS when you infuse it with an Attitude Era type of style. Even its ridiculous moments have appeal as many of them are now meme royalty. It's like tuna on white bread with no crust; some might think it's crappy, but others will keep coming back for it. Best watched a quarter mile at a time.",mediatation,2024-06-17,2024

7.0,The Fast and The Furious - Jamison Slabaugh,This is a fun thrilling street race film. It's very good for its time. I'll start with the things that don't work very well for me. The loud hard rock during a lot of the races. Some of the pacing in the film is not handled very well either. I also think a few cuts in the film are not done well either. Now talking about the praise I have for the movie. It's super fun and a good street race film. Brian is a great character. The inner conflict that he has is handled very well because he loves Mia but he knows that Dom is the one who has been hijacking the trucks and he looking for someone else to take the blame. On top of that he is friends with Dom at this point and they are close. And in the end he gives up catching Dom and gives up his car so that he can get away. Dom is a strong character because the film does a good job of making the audience sympathetic towards him. It's sad that he had to watch his father burn to death and for 11 seconds of anger and rage ruined a large part of his life. Mia is a strong love interest because she isn't just bossed around and she does what she thinks and believes is right in the end instead of making emotional decisions. The ending leaves you feeling somewhat unsatisfied in my opinion and that is one week point. Overall a fun movie. 6/10 STARS.,jamisonslabaugh,2024-07-04,2024
8.0,"""Ask any racer. Any real racer. It don't matter if you win by an inch or a mile. Winning's winning.""","FILM: 8.0
Rewatching the 2001 film The Fast and the Furious, I find myself appreciating it even more. I've said this before, but I still think this film is the best entry in the series. The cast, characters, and plot all work so well together to sell the fun and drama, creating a cohesive and engaging experience.One of the things I enjoy most about this film is its simpler approach. The story revolves around street racing and undercover investigations, with a focus on realistic driving rather than over-the-top stunts. I like that it's less reliant on CGI and the driving sequences feel more authentic. This grounded style makes the action more believable and immersive.I appreciate that the film doesn't ask me to believe that cars can fly, or that fistfights on planes with never-ending runways are a thing, or that battles between cars and submarines are legitimate. Sometimes, less is more, and The Fast and the Furious proves that by keeping the action and drama within the realm of possibility.The chemistry between Paul Walker and Vin Diesel is fantastic. Their dynamic adds depth to the story and makes the characters' relationships feel genuine. Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster also deliver strong performances, rounding out a cast that brings charisma and energy to the screen.The plot, while straightforward, is compelling. The blend of high-octane racing scenes and undercover cop drama keeps me engaged from start to finish. There's a sense of raw excitement and tension that still holds up, even after multiple viewings.Overall, my rewatch of The Fast and the Furious is a mostly positive experience that reminds me why I fell in love with the series in the first place. The film's realistic driving scenes, strong cast, and effective storytelling make it a standout in the franchise. It's a film that I can always come back to and enjoy.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.5

10.0,One of my favorite movies ever,"The first installment of Fast and Furious is a thrilling, adrenaline-pumping ride that set the foundation for one of the most successful and beloved action franchises of all time. This film has everything: heart-pounding car chases, unforgettable stunts, intense rivalries, and a raw look into the underground world of street racing.

The chemistry between Vin Diesel and Paul Walker is magnetic, blending loyalty and tension in a way that feels both authentic and compelling. Diesel's portrayal of Dominic Toretto, the fearless and loyal leader, contrasts perfectly with Walker's undercover cop, Brian O'Conner, creating a dynamic that keeps the audience hooked from start to finish.

What makes Fast and Furious stand out is its seamless mix of action, character development, and story. The film doesn't rely on its epic car sequences alone (though they are phenomenal); it also invests in the relationships between its characters, giving weight to every high-speed decision and daring maneuver.

The movie is pure fun-a nonstop thrill ride that redefined the action genre and left an enduring legacy. Whether you're a car enthusiast or just looking for an electrifying cinematic experience, Fast and Furious is an absolute must-see.

Prepare to buckle up because this movie is a full-throttle joyride. 10/10, a perfect action classic.",Bmore-Hero,2024-09-17,2024
10.0,Best Fast and Furious,"Despite the craziness in the new Fast and Furious movies this one holds it's own in reality. This is a believable film that tells the story about family trying to make ends meet and maintaining the trust they hold so close to their heart. Paul Walker gives a great performance that fits his character perfectly. I love how you watch Paul Walker fall in love with Mia and struggle with his identity. He knows that his place is with Dom, but find himself displaced and trying to hold on to his old life as a cop. As far as fast and furious movies go this is by far one of the best ones. It's not until you get to five that it starts to get a little out of control.",kicih-60561,2024-09-19,2024
6.0,"Yeah, it's funny how that works out.","The plot is similar to the 1991 cult classic Point Break. The backstories are scattered, and filled with over-the-top racing sequences and action scenes. This film feels like a standalone; at the time, they didn't seem to be thinking about a sequel. The background music fails to make an impact and is often noisy and distracting on many occasions. Some scenes, like hijacking a truck with Honda Civics to steal VHS players, feel illogical and foolish. The investigator's office scenes are boring and annoying due to poor acting and dialogue.Walker and Diesel give average performances, bouncing off one another but unable to convey a deeper emotional level. Rodriguez is particularly bad with her constant frowning and poor one-liners, while Brewster delivers a decent performance. Overall, an unoriginal undercover plot that focuses more on car racing and an unrelatable underground culture with slutty women.",sunesh6,2024-10-14,2024

Vin and Paul are phenomenal in this franchise. Can't believe this was 23 years ago already. Never get tired of watching this one. Who would've ever thought when this came out that it would spawn over a dozen films including spin offs and span over 3 decades. Go check out this amazing movie if you haven't seen it yet. I hope they never stop making these wonderful movies even if they have gotten far fetched, they are still better than most of what is put out today. Fast and furious will always be the best.",movielover4ever22,2024-11-03,2024
6.0,Somehow this is the most grounded entry in the franchise.,"A friend who hasn't seen them wants to go through all the films together. We're one film in and I'm half regretting it and half strapped in for the ride. I've only seen up to 7 before, but the trailers for the films past that are incredible in their own way.This one was actually ok, it made me nostalgic for PS1 games even though I never had that console.There were some surprisingly real human moments and neat stunts spread throughout the film, but the overall experience was marred by some bad CGI, weird NOS logic, and a 10 second drag race that actually had a screen time of two minutes. This isn't anime. I think I have yet to see a drag race on film that's interesting. Isn't most of the fun in the prep?Regardless, I'm kind of shocked that this became a series that's still running (probably on gas by this point) 22 years later, with it's eleventh entry. I wonder what dumb bodywork they'll do on the title.",H4wke,2024-11-06,2024
9.0,There is something about the early 2000's movies I love.,"The Fast and the Furious is a fast-paced action film that uses street racing as a backdrop, with a slick and fast-paced storyline. The film features an undercover cop who finds his loyalty divided between his job and his love for his double life and a deep friendship with his target. The film is slick and fast-paced, with many garrulously painted, tricked-out imports graced the screen. The cars used in the driving sequences are impressive, even for non-car enthusiasts. Paul Walker, the main star, delivers an easygoing, dude-like performance, comparing him to young Paul Newman or Robert Redford. He is an uber-good looking pin-up boy with just the right amount of roughness around his edges. Co-star Vin Diesel is equally assured on-screen, with charisma from his scene-stealing riffs in Pitch Black and The Boiler Room. The rest of the cast is rounded out by young stars like Chad Lindberg, Michelle Rodriguez, Matt Schulze, Johnny Strong, and Jordana Brewster. Despite the cliched undercover cop themeology, the film is a fun and entertaining diversion in this summer of stagnated epics and dundering blockbusters. The film's editing style and the use of street racing as a backdrop make it an entertaining and entertaining film. The Fast and the Furious is a thrilling film that pays tribute to Bullitt and The Road Warrior with minimal CGI enhancements. The driving sequences are both thrilling and nail-biting, with a nighttime heist scene and a final heist that resembles RW. The FX and stunt teams use CGI rendering to create zoom lens, manga-styled madness during street racing sequences or take the viewer on an Alice in Wonderland trip through an NOS-injected internal combustion system. The film is loud, brash, and entertaining, making it a perfect summer film. The cast keeps themselves in tune with the storyline without being too campy, and the film is a must-watch for fans of the franchise. ""The Fast and the Furious"" is a movie that takes place in a world beyond the law, with Vin Diesel as Toretto, a star of street racing. The film features a slicker production than films like ""Grand Theft Auto,"" but still has a pirate spirit. It features great chase scenes and includes the most incompetent cop who ever went undercover. The movie takes place in Los Angeles, where cars four abreast speed down city streets. Brian, a man who wants to break into street racing, meets his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) at a bar where she serves tuna salad on white bread, no crusts. Brian saves Toretto's friendship by saving him from the cops. The races involve cars four abreast at speedway speeds down city streets, making it easier in Los Angeles due to the lack of traffic and cops. Brian initially appears just like a guy who wants to race, but is revealed as a cop in an early scene. He works for a unit with its undercover headquarters in a Hollywood house, and his boss claims that Eddie Fisher built this house for Elizabeth Taylor in the 1950s. The movie tells a story and explains its characters, providing a refreshing change from no-plot, all-action movies like ""Gone in 60 Seconds."" It also shows Paul and Mia falling in love, although it is not supposed to be done in theory. Michelle Rodriguez, the star of the boxing movie ""Girlfight,"" co-stars as a member of the hijack gang and gets to land one solid right on a guy's jaw to keep her credentials. While its na amazing movie, ""The Fast and the Furious"" delivers what it promises to deliver, with grandiose self-pitying dialogue that has been treasured in movies like ""Rebel Without a Cause.""",moviesfilmsreviewsinc,2024-12-16,2024

10.0,"DAMN, I would pick this movie as the GOAT","Imagine as an officer of the law, and you are send undercover to bring an end to the this racing...I bet you an awful load of cash, you will resign and sign up for the racing, it's not Paul Walker's fault, it's just that the racing was freaking addictive. Going undercover is never easy, especially with such affable miscreants.The basic premise is really nothing special. But then again, it doesn't need to be. The point of this movie is in its style. It has fast cars, lots of racing, lots of hot, greased-up babes, muscle-heavy men (and cars) and a killer soundtrack. You don't watch it to be intrigued by carefully orchestrated plot points or tragic backstories or the heaviness of its pathos. No, you watch it to kick back, relax and have a good time.And in delivering that, the movie more than delivers. But if it was just that, I'd probably rate the film a bit lower. What actually elevates this film above its immediate peers and helped launch a huge franchise, is the fact that this film is punching above its weight class and succeeding.It's one of those movies you dream about, talk about and even try to drive like Vin Diesel. Thumbs up to that guy.",mukogomalvern,2025-01-02,2025

I wasn't watching this film for the cars or street races this film is about robbery, as a string of high-speed electronics truck robberies rocks the area. The Team stole $1.2 million worth of major electronics and the cops doesn't have any leads who has done it. There is only one team that could be responsible, Dominic Torreto (Vin Diesel) and his gang of street racers. During the night Torreto and his crew of street racers are driving cars in Los Angeles. Brian O'Conner (Paul walker) a undercover LAPD officer under the alias ""Brian Earl Spilner"", is he assigned to find out who is stealing the merchandise.This is my favorite film, it is an decent Action film about heist $1.2 million and not about the cars.

10.0,The Beginning,"This is the movie that created a brand new mega movie franchise. Generally when there's movie franchises they make movies in the form of trilogies. But later this year when Fast and the Furious 6 comes out it'll be the sixth movie in the series which shows the level of box office appeal the series has to be able to pump out an average of 1 movie every two years is quite impressive. The only other series doing that kind of productivity with different directors on basically a once every 2 year rate is the James Bond series.

Vin Diesel who outside of his other series Riddick movies generally puts out mediocre to bad performances was basically made to play the role of Dominic Torretto. Same goes for Paul Walker, normally when I see he's going to be in a movie I don't bother watching it.",nyashabanda,2025-01-02,2025

10.0,The Fast and the Furious (2001) - 10/10. Period.,"Before the globe-trotting, submarine-fighting, and space-faring escapades that define the later chapters of this franchise, there was a humble street racing flick that captured the hearts of a generation, and it's still just as potent today. We're talking about the OG, the one that started it all, the 2001 masterpiece that is The Fast and the Furious. It's a film that exists in a glorious, simpler time, a time before Spec Ops missions and world-ending stakes, a time when the biggest problem was figuring out how to beat your rival in a quarter-mile.What makes this movie so damn good? Let's start with the heart of it all - the characters. The relationship between Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker, may he rest in peace) and Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) is pure magic. It's a classic forbidden romance, the undercover cop falling for the sister of the man he's investigating. Chemistry practically bleeds off the screen, and their interactions are both sweet and genuinely relatable. Then there's Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), a man with a shadow of a past, a code of honor that rivals any knight in shining armor. He's tough, brooding, and fiercely loyal, and his troubled but ultimately good heart makes him imminently captivating. And let's be honest, who didn't instantly like Brian? He's the fresh-faced newbie thrown into a world he doesn't fully understand, and his journey from clueless cop to a part of the family is one of the most satisfying arcs in the whole series. And let's not discount Mia - she's the glue that holds this whole operation together, keeping the temperamental men in check and providing a much-needed sense of groundedness to their world. She's smart, kind, and fiercely protective of her family.Beyond the characters, the movie is just dripping in early 2000s Badassery. The soundtrack alone is a time capsule, a perfect blend of hard rock, rap, and electronica that perfectly encapsulates the energy of the street racing scene (Shoutout to Ja Rule, Limp Bizkit etc !). It's the type of music that makes you want to rev your engine (responsibly, of course). And then there are the cars. Oh, the cars! From the sleek JDM imports to the muscle cars with chrome galore, every vehicle is a character in itself. These weren't just cars; they were symbols of freedom, speed, and counter-culture. The visuals are undeniably iconic, with those neon-lit races and the camera work that made you feel like you were right in the middle of the action.What's remarkable is the simplicity of the plot. It's a straightforward story of betrayal, loyalty, and the bond of family, with high-octane racing thrown into the mix. It doesn't try to be anything more than what it is: a fun, adrenaline-fueled ride with characters you genuinely care about. And that's why it still works, even 23 years later. It was watchable in 2001, and it's still undeniably entertaining in 2025. In fact, it might even get better with age, becoming a sort of vintage classic that serves as a reminder of the series' humble roots.For me, The Fast and the Furious is always in the top three of the series, and it's not just nostalgia talking. It's the perfect blend of character, action, and atmosphere. It's lightning in a bottle, a cultural phenomenon that captured the spirit of a generation. It will forever hold a special place in my heart, not just as a Fast and Furious movie, but as a truly great film. 10/10. Need I say more?",douglasc11,2025-01-02,2025

10.0,This was a good racing movie,"Over the years, the franchise has smashed box office records, increasingly ridiculous action set pieces, amusement park rides (Yes really!), and of course aforementioned hilarious memes!Though ego maniac Vin Diesel and others claim the long-running series will end after the tenth instalment, which has now recently been broken into two separate parts for some reason, I'm honestly convinced this franchise will never end...Call it NOS-talgia if you'd like, but the original Fast still has its charms that have lasted all of these years!Part of the joy of this film is that, in comparison to all of the other entries, it feels so small in scope and scale.Imagine if the sequels never happened, this would probably be a fun little relic of the early 2000s!In actuality, it's where the seeds were planted for the characters that continue to stick around.Most of the series' iconic hallmarks are already here on display; the BBQs, the familia, and yes, the Coronas!Give the film credit for actually being fairly character-driven, despite the action-heavy scenes.",shanemtetwa,2025-01-02,2025
10.0,Paul walker,"This movie franchise has been around since before I was born. I've seen every movie at least 5 times, and not one has disappointed me. I love the fact that they use a variety of different vehicles from different places around the world. One thing that kinda bothers me is the fact that since Brian(Paul Walker, Rest In Peace) died, the movies seem as if the characters are more or less heroes than street racers. If universal studios could maybe town down on the heroic scenes and more street racing scenes, I would be beyond happy. But other than that, I highly recommend this series to car lovers! Fast and Furious was a very good movie that had a darker and more serious tone than any of the prior films in the franchise. I loved seeing almost the entire original cast return and the amazing cars and impressive special effects that are a staple of the series return once again...",tinasheponde,2025-01-02,2025
10.0,Awesomeness,As a person who loves romantic comedies i was a little sceptical about the movie. Paul walker made the movie exceptional. I really didn't expect that action packed movie to blow my mind. Sometimes it's not right to judge the movie merely because they say it's an action movie. I really really appreciate the production team as it was well executed and it did not feel fake. Action movies have a tendency of being over tbe top but for the first time in history this movie was right on right on.... A definite undeniable ten out of ten for me and I'm usually not generous with my marks on reviews generally.,charmizle,2025-01-02,2025

10.0,It is indeed fast and furious one of the underated movie,"Officer Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) goes undercover in the Los Angeles street racing circuits in order to find out which of the racing crews is committing crimes with their muscle cars. But going undercover is never easy, especially with such affable miscreants.The basic premise is really nothing special. But then again, it doesn't need to be. The point of this movie is in its style. It has fast cars, lots of racing, lots of hot, greased-up babes, muscle-heavy men (and cars) and a killer soundtrack. You don't watch it to be intrigued by carefully orchestrated plot points or tragic backstories or the heaviness of its pathos. No, you watch it to kick back, relax and have a good time.And in delivering that, the movie more than delivers. But if it was just that, I'd probably rate the film a bit lower. What actually elevates this film above its immediate peers and helped launch a huge franchise, is the fact that this film is punching above its weight class and succeeding. And it does that by having some real good actors playing roles they were born to play. Walker is one of them, but I also have to mention Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez.Thumbs up to these great legends they really deserve to be applauded.

10.0,Fast and furious 2005 review,"SReleased in 2001, ""The Fast and the Furious"" marked the inception of a film franchise that would become a cultural phenomenon. Directed by Rob Cohen, this action-packed film blends elements of street racing, crime drama, and undercover police work. The movie stars Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner, an undercover cop tasked with infiltrating the world of illegal street racing to investigate a series of high-profile truck hijackings. Vin Diesel plays Dominic Toretto, a skilled street racer and mechanic who becomes both a mentor and friend to Brian.

Plot Summary

The narrative revolves around Brian O'Conner's dual life as he navigates his role as an undercover officer while trying to gain the trust of Dominic Toretto and his crew. The film opens with a thrilling hijacking scene where a group of masked robbers uses high-tech equipment to steal electronics from a moving truck. This sets the stage for Brian's mission: to uncover the identity of those behind these heists.

As Brian becomes more involved with Dominic's crew, he develops complex relationships with several characters, including Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster), Dominic's sister, and Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez), Dominic's girlfriend. The film explores themes of loyalty, friendship, and betrayal as Brian grapples with his growing affection for Mia and his commitment to his job.

Character Development

One of the film's strengths lies in its character development. Brian O'Conner starts as an outsider but gradually earns respect within the street racing community. His evolution is mirrored by his relationship with Dominic Toretto, who embodies the spirit of loyalty and family that permeates throughout the franchise. As Brian delves deeper into this world, he faces moral dilemmas that challenge his initial motivations for being there.

Dominic Toretto is portrayed as a charismatic leader whose passion for cars and racing is matched only by his fierce loyalty to those he considers family. This dynamic creates tension when Brian must ultimately choose between his duty as a police officer and his newfound bonds within Dominic's circle.

Cinematic Techniques

""The Fast and the Furious"" employs various cinematic techniques that enhance its storytelling. The use of practical effects during car races adds authenticity to the high-octane action sequences. While some scenes utilize CGI for dramatic effect, many stunts were performed by professional drivers using real vehicles, which contributes to the film's visceral impact.

Also Dominic's performance is tremendous, besides fast and furious being a great movie we also get to learn a lot about loyalty and betrayal.

10.0,Loyalty is hard to find!,"Blurring the boundaries between your personal and professional lives can lead to conflicts of interest, compromise professional relationships, influence decision-making, and give the impression that you are biased, all of which can negatively impact your career and personal life. For this reason, it is crucial to avoid combining business and pleasure. The majority of undercover police officers often become so consumed in their assignments that they lose sight of their objective. Brian began establishing a relationship with Dom and Mia in an attempt to gain their trust, but the more he learned about their family's devotion and upbringing, the more he desired to be a part of it.

6.0,First lap of ten - wait there's ten of these?,"Finally going to be chugging through this franchise, plainly just to see for myself how we go from here, a relatively chill street racing pomp thriller, to whatever the gargantuan hell was happening in Fast X, with cars launched into space and every apparent world leader trying to assassinate these people. If nothing else it'll be a teaching moment for how quickly a sense of scale and overall realism can be torpedoed by piling on sequels. Just making more and more films based solely on the idea of ""it has to be fast"" and ""it has to be furious.""There is a part of me itching to see precisely when the films drop the act of taking themselves even a little bit dramatically serious and lean into this bizarro teen guy dreamland, or maybe it's a gradual thing and each entry will get more and more stupid. Either way, I'm unreasonably excited. Unreasonably because there's already a lot of warning signs in this starter film - which is meant to be one of the bright spots in this decalogy - as no character is really given an identity apart from Paul Walker and Vin Diesel, the music cues are unmistakably 2001, and the most compelling story beats are given no conclusive explanation, just left to the dust as another neon-coloured attack to your eyes veers offscreen.

7.0,The Original and still worth the watch,"This is where it all started. The Fast and The Furious franchise has become a bit of a meme with how many there have been, but the success of the franchise owes it all to this original movie that changed the way an entire generation of men looked at cars (for better or for worse). I am not into most of the cars featured, but American Muscle makes an appearance as well in a great way. The story, the acting, the action, it is all good in this movie and it is easy to understand why the franchise has had so much success.

6.0,A Thrilling Ride with Limitations,"The Fast and the Furious (2001) is a high-octane action film that kicks off one of Hollywood's most successful franchises. The movie delivers on its promise of fast cars, intense street racing, and adrenaline-pumping action, creating an electrifying experience for fans of the genre. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker have undeniable chemistry as the leads, with Diesel's commanding presence and Walker's relatability balancing the dynamic. The film's underground car culture is portrayed with a certain charm, and the high-speed races are thrilling, providing a lot of visual excitement.However, while the film succeeds in its action and visual appeal, its plot and character development feel somewhat underwhelming. The story, centered around an undercover cop infiltrating a group of street racers, feels predictable and clichÃ©d at times. The dialogue can be cheesy, and some of the supporting characters lack depth, relying more on stereotypes than fully fleshed-out personalities. The film's pacing can also drag in moments where it focuses on non-racing action or exposition.The Fast and the Furious is undeniably entertaining, but it's not without its flaws. It serves up plenty of fun for fans of high-speed action, but those looking for more substance or sophisticated storytelling might find themselves wanting more. Still, it laid the foundation for a beloved franchise that would eventually grow into a much grander, globe-trotting saga.",fahimrcs,2025-01-17,2025

He wasn't from Steubenville was he? He was from a large metropolitan area where he could blend in better. I couldn't move back to Pittsburgh bc of the trapeze acts, and I couldn't move to small-town Ohio bc of these car racers.Did I find the movie horrific? No. The movie was enjoyable, but there wasn't anything more than a speed game here. Most of the time, speed isn't the best option. There was a disagreement. Some thought he was a fighting monk. Others thought he was an anarchist. I didn't hear about the part where he only had an 8th grade education and would always beat up his ""wife."" He would always find a woman to blame (even an innocent one), and he would always try to get his ""wife"" to take the bait and beat up the other woman (even if she was innocent).

7.0,Fast & Furious - When Speed Replaces the Brain,"Toretto rules the streets of Los Angeles like a roaring warlord, with cars tricked out like modern knights' armor ready to slap you at 250 km/h. Paul Walker shows up, flashing his Colgate smile, to go undercover and bust the baddies hijacking semi-trucks. But instead of arresting anyone, he falls in love-with speed, adrenaline, and a bromance with Vin Diesel, the bald powerhouse who values engines more than logic. Basically, it's Point Break with chrome rims and blue neon lights under the hood.The dialogue? A mix of auto mechanic manuals and teenage trash talk. The supporting characters? As deep as an oil puddle. But let's be real-you're not here for philosophical monologues on turbochargers. You're here for insane races where drivers shift gears 14 times in 200 meters, all while smirking in the face of physics. And on that front, the movie delivers.Vin Diesel is like a tank: slow, powerful, and impossible to stop once he's rolling. The guy exudes more presence with a few grunts than some actors do with entire Shakespearean soliloquies. His Dom Toretto is part Mad Max warrior, part toxic older brother who teaches you to tune your car while dragging you into life-or-death street races.Walker plays the undercover cop who transitions from clean-cut officer to the guy who could steal your girlfriend and your car in the same night. His internal conflict? Loyalty: one day he's a cop, the next he's chugging lukewarm beers in Dom's garage, preaching the gospel of ""family forever."" But let's be honest, with that charm, he could've infiltrated any gang and gotten adopted like a lovable Labrador.Let's face it-the real stars of Fast & Furious are the cars. From souped-up Civics to iconic muscle cars, every scene is a tribute to mechanical overkill. Even when the gravity-defying stunts make you roll your eyes, you can't help but admire the spectacle, like watching a fireworks display at a cheap neighborhood fair.Fast & Furious doesn't pretend to be anything more than a motorized stress reliever. If you're hoping for introspective drama, go watch some Bergman. Here, it's all about pedal to the metal, dodging cops, and never hitting the brakes. It smells like gasoline, leather jackets, and bro-talk, but somehow, it's ridiculously fun.",OniFR,2025-02-03,2025
