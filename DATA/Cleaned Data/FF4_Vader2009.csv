7.0,"Still fast, still furious","Fast and Furious, or 4 Fast 4 Furious if you're keeping count, is a movie you can basically sum up in one sentence. Muscle guys, muscle cars, hot chicks, and incredible action sequences. Not much has changed in the four films other than who the muscle guys wind up being played by but nonetheless, if you're going to the movies strictly to continually watch these things, then not only will this series run forever, but you should have no problem sitting through this fourth flick. Of course the other thing to look at here is the resurrection of Vin Diesel's action star persona, and considering he's been doing movies like ‘Babylon AD’ and ‘The Pacifier’ for the past couple years, you can basically say this is one of his better performances in a real long time. The plot is pretty thin but I'm sure for fans of the first movie it will be nice to see the two leads back playing their roles. Diesel reprises wanted felon Dom Toretto, who after escaping at the end of the first movie seems to have started a new life in the Dominican Republic knocking over trucks. What brings him back to Los Angeles is revenge for the death of his girlfriend (Michelle Rodriguez) at the hands of brutal drug dealers led by Braga. This brings him face to face with the man who infiltrated his gang in the first flick, Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), now an FBI agent going after the same drug dealers. And wouldn't you know that driving plays a big part in Braga's whole smuggling operation so both Brian and Dom team up, amidst some trust issues, to bring down the drug cartel. Hopefully director Justin Lin (‘Tokyo Drift’) gets the credit he deserves this time around. He's fantastic with these action sequences, not only making them pulse-pounding thrill rides but also letting you feel like you're in the car with these characters. The movie starts out brilliantly with a propane truck hi-jacking that turns life or death when things get out of control and the truck barrels down on the hi-jackers, and then just continues to go full throttle, staging a race on a crowded Los Angeles street and then chases in an underground tunnel shaft. Once these characters get in their cars you won't be bored for a moment. Outside the car is a different matter though. Both actors do what they can. Diesel is adrenaline personified. With his gravelly voice, bulging biceps, and cool, playful way around a line of dialogue, he's a lot of fun to watch. And while still pretty wooden, I admit that Walker has a pretty-boy face and an athletic physicality that makes him a good hero. This pairing worked well in the first movie, sort of like an amateur, yet entertaining, version of the adrenaline-seeking- cop and criminal formula a la ‘Point Break.’ Just after four movies it's all gotten stale and it's easy to see that the cars are the real stars here. The Dom-Brian conflict and Dom's vendetta against the cartel is mostly overshadowed and there isn't much for either character to do when away from their vehicles. Diesel and Walker try but they always seem to be a couple wheels short of competing with the four-wheel drive. ‘Fast and Furious’ deserves credit for doing the key things well. If your expecting much from anything other than the cars then it's a disappointment, but thanks to Justin Lin this has all the makings of a really thrilling action movie, making this fourth flick in the series a little bit better than its predecessors and a lot of fun.",C-Younkin,2009-03-30,2009,Positive,0.061,0.77,0.17,0.9974
4.0,First Five Minutes. Over,"Definitely, good for car-fans. Since I'm not one of them, I tried to view it as objectively as I could.The first five minutes rock indeed - a masterwork of ""road-action"". But, once we get over them, and the REAL ACTION begins, all goes constantly down, to ultimately fall sort of flat. The main failure remains what was purported to me, in the movie-writing terminology, the ""main event"": the demented car race trough the Los Angeles traffic - much below what it should have been! Between the chases and other hot-wheels scenes, the story-line is uselessly complicated, and the directing, correct and nothing more. Points again for he stylish animation of the final credits. And this should be all. Sadly inferior to ""Death Race"", for instance, which DID KNOW how to deliver to motor-fans!",Mihnea_aka_Pitbull,2009-04-01,2009,Negative,0.137,0.817,0.046,-0.9504
4.0,In automatic transmission,"Exhausted and pretty much running on synthetic artistry, ""Fast & Furious"" not only drops its definite article from the title but also much of the natural car chase sequences and canny blithe in place of heavily computer-generated action set pieces and a palpably inappropriate seriousness. Returning director Justin Lin (from the third installment ""The Fast & The Furious: Tokyo Drift"") impersonally helms this fourth installment that reunites its original lead cast for more physics-defying engines, brain-dead logic, scantily clad bimbos, and foot worship for good measure.Not that its target audience would primarily look for it but there's a plot and it involves Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) who's out to avenge the murder of a loved one courtesy of a drug kingpin. This leads him to another reluctant team-up with undercover FBI agent Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) and once again they are thrust into hazardous street racing from downtown LA to Mexico, and the run-of-the-mill narrative more or less goes into auto-drive from here.Largely debilitating for this latest hot rod project is its cliché-ridden script that has not a meager of inventiveness or eagerness, a sentiment apparently shared by its actors who are simply going through the motions, specially Diesel who highlights ""Fast & Furious""' misplaced intentness by exhibiting a labored sensitivity despite the caricature machismo. And though everything that has kept the series going is here gratuitously put at disposal, which is to say loads of wheels and hot-looking females, as a whole it starts to feel repetitive - a redundant profit-oriented scheme that cannot be saved by the sporadic appearance of Jordana Brewster.",Jay_Exiomo,2009-04-01,2009,Positive,0.097,0.791,0.112,0.5426
10.0,"Great action, Nice cars and plenty of sexy babes too!","I built this movie of 6 reels last night and screened it in the theater where I work at , Great movie loved it, nice cars nice babes too! Plenty of action and some romance. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker getting a little aged. He (Walker) shows it too when getting his ass kicked by Vin screaming and kicking like a little girl that he is, (funny) Jordana Brewster nice addition to the crew. Hope we see more of this sweet heart in the future! Muscle beats imports any day! you are 4 miles from your destination, you are now 1 mile from your destination!

8.0,Is this one the best one yet?,"This was a good movie. They were able to bring back all the things that made the first one great like Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, and Paul Walker, and let go of the things that did not work so well. All the things that you loved in the first one are here and a little more. Vin Diesel does a great job from start to finish. In parts of the movie it almost makes you want to leave your seat and cheer. For all you Paul Walker haters out there he did a good job as well. He is like a backup quarterback in the NFL you want him to manage the game don't try to do to much just do what is takes to win. Walker is not the star of the movie, but behind the star he manages his part well. He does a good job of playing his part and not going beyond that and try to make a great performance. Walker acts within his ability. I for one am not a Walker hater so I never felt like he did a bad job, but I know there are a lot of you out there and you will be happy with his performance in this movie. Just the right blind of action and cars. For all the people that loved Han from Tokyo Drift don't get really excited, his role is only for about 3 minutes at the beginning of the movie. This is not a movie that is going to win any Academy Awards, but it is a movie that will keep you entertain for an hour and forty five minutes. Worth the movie to pay to see this one in the theater. Which is saying a lot for the way the economy is right now. It is the best one in the series.",blake-brown20,2009-04-02,2009,Positive,0.05,0.744,0.206,0.995
10.0,"Great movie, better than present movies","This is a great movie. A lot of action, deep drama, common-sense dialogue. This is pretty much a little grown up movie. This is definitely not a video game kind of movie. Vin Diesel is good in this movie with deep drama and struggle. I liked the dialogue that was real world. I liked the cars.This movie is definitely recommended for all younger people if you like or not like cars. This movie also doesn't have too much racing, which is fine. Watch the movie and your weekend will be much more entertaining. Ending was great too.Director Justin Lin did a fine job of directing the movie, which is crucial to sequel movies that tend to lose the depth and character development. He actually made it more serious movie than I expected and character development is well. I was expecting non-sense 24/7 racing with no dialogue, which it wasn't like that.",tom1111,2009-04-02,2009,Positive,0.071,0.718,0.211,0.9763
6.0,Same formula,"Comparing the original, I would say this sequel falls short of expectation. The storyline is very cliché and it is very predictive. Its the same tried and tested formula, similar to the 1st two movies. I don't see the Fast and Furious series movie this way. Tokyo Drift brought something different to the table, which I've to give Justin Lin the credit for it. This movie however goes back to the preview plot outlines of 1 and 2. Vin and Paul don't bring conviction in their roles, which I feel they probably opted for this movie for the sake of it.On the whole its popcorn fun. You get to see fast cars, hot chicks and good action sequences.I rate it 6/10",vishr,2009-04-02,2009,Positive,0.028,0.887,0.085,0.7506
6.0,Again,"Before i write anything about the movie the reason they make sequels is for money especially this one since they brought back the original cast. If you like the fast and the furious saga then definitely this is a must see, they brought back the two hottest stars of the saga for the sequel. The plot like usual isn't what captures the viewers attention, its always the cars and hot girls. They reunited Vin Diesel and Paul Walker which is great but we don't want to see the same cars again. Nissan Skyline is a great tuner vehicle but we've seen it before same goes for the American muscle. This one has similarities like the first movie of the series which is the drama scenes which were a lot more than the action sequences. The action sequences done in the car were eye catching but the chase done on feet was unrealistic and brutal, even the first action scene where Diesel drives under the gasoline truck was plain ‘stupid’. The first one was about the tuned up cars and the storybetween Paul walker and Vin diesel, 2nd one was about crime and alittle action, third one was fully about drifting, and now they reunited the hottest stars of the saga to recreate the magic of the trilogy. It has everything except the ‘magic’,it relvoves around the death of Michelle Rodriguez which is already a downfall since she is proabaly the best girl for the job. The critics have bashed this movie, some critics say it's 8thgrader vocabulary used in the script, but lets be straight forward we don't watch movies like this for stories or the never ending drama, if we wanted watch movies like that we'll only watch Oscar nominated movies. Action flicks like these are enjoyed by viewers, scenes that capture your attention and blow you away, making the impossible stunts possible. From what i heard there is a 5th installment which is good news for people who love cars from American muscle to tuned up skyline's. I am excited about the 5th version only if Micheal bay could direct the movie it will certainly have extraordinary chase sequences.If you liked the first three then it's worth a look, don't get overly manipulated by the critics and watch it for entertainment value and don't expect the story to be creative. I wouldn't rate this movie out of 10 but it deserves a 6 just for the fact many scenes could have been improved maybe they cut back on the budget but it's worth viewing it at the big screen.",babu_145,2009-04-02,2009,Positive,0.065,0.779,0.156,0.9929
8.0,Now that's what being FAST is about!!!,"FAST..........FASTER and.......FASTEST.........all three words describe this one helluva action packed n pacey roller coaster ride........... The Movie opens to an exceedingly amazing action sequence where Dom n his friends, including Letty try to do what they are best at.......yup u right heist.........WOW!!! what a scene. Right after that the movie takes a serious path for a short while. Where Dom leaves Letty sleeping n goes away from her n goes to Panama. That's where he receives a bad news about someone's death(i won't disclose it) but it was a shock.......coz dat was d best character in d series. He then sets out to track down the one responsible. In comes Mr O'Connor looking like that something has changed and believe me it has changed for the better This 'New Model, Old Parts' is working. The action sequences are perfectly shot, Direction is cool, acting was amazing, Vin was cool as ever, the jokes were on the right place and in the right proportion. I thought it was better than Fast And The Furious(part 1). Although in the fast paced movie the script wasn't given much emphasis. But who needs a detailed script if the screenplay is damn good and can keep you on the edge of your seat. I go for 8 out of 10 for Fast and Furious 4.........The Fast just got Faster.....and how.

10.0,Fantastic & Fabulous movie,"The movie is awesome man ,just awesome.U cant afford to miss it.I saw this first day first show & liked it very much.Now listening the films OSTs.Vin Diesel delivered his best after a long time.His last movie Babylon A D was a huge flop (in terms of revenue,though i liked his bad a$$ acting as a retired mercenary.In this Vin Diesel delivers his best,he just picks it up where he left off in F&F 1.The story also tries to tie the loose ends & answer some questions which were in the fans minds.Paul Walker also did great job.He added some comic timings in the movie which could make u laugh in some serious moments.I never liked Michelle nor Jordana,so I wont comment on them.Gal Gadot is the new chick whom u should look for ;).IMO shes hotter than other two.Shes the new girl on the F&F series :D Btw don't miss the opening of the movie.Coz start from the beginning,the movie has some great car revving & tire screeching scenes.When u have nice cars,Vin Diesel,Gal Gadot.Do u need a plot? If u want a plot driven go watch The Wrestler or Changeling :P Anyways coming back to the point,this movie deserves a watch at theaters only.Btw this is not the last installment of the series.....at least we can hope so.Rating : I give 4 out 5 Why did I cut the 1 out 5?Coz at the beginning there was Spanish to which no subs was provided :D",spycid,2009-04-02,2009,Positive,0.056,0.775,0.17,0.9871
8.0,Definitaly better than Tokyo Drift,"I saw this movie about an hour ago.. overall i was pretty pleased with it the action is great. but the writing was a bit off some of the dialogue seemed corny and unnecessary.. i found my self almost laughing at lines that were supposed to be dramatic.. kinda like in twilight. id say it wasn't as good as the first but definitely the second best of the series.. the reason the first was better is because JA RULE was in it ha.. its not how you stand by your car, its how you race your car haha..only other complaint i guess is that its not really about racing anymore.. for example the first one was more about the culture of underground street racing.oh and Mia in this movie is a bit scary i guess she forgot how she did the original role because she almost looks like she has a joker smile ha",coreycat09,2009-04-02,2009,Positive,0.068,0.72,0.212,0.9784
8.0,A complete reboot of the franchise,"How do I sum up Fast and Furious. Well before I go any further let me just say that it was everything I expected and more. This movie was a reboot for the franchise, just as much as Batman Begins was for batman, Casino Royal was for Bond, The Incredible HULK was for the hulk series etc. It features a lot more of a dramatic storyline then the other movies and isn't just a complete popcorn flick displaying a lot of emotion and relasionships between the characters. The movie almost seems to play out now as more of a crime drama then a racing movie, but also features a lot of the racing high paced action we know and love.Well on with the characters/story for the movie. This movie features a returning cast from the past The Fast and the Furious movies. We have Vin Deisel back as Dom, Paul Walker back as Brian, Michell Rodriguez as Letty, Jordan Brewster as Mia, and other characters that return in the form of camio appearances(just to let you know, no Tyrese or Lucas Black). I thought all of the characters did a really good job, and their relasionships and emotions were explored a lot more. So the acting is a big upgrade from the past movies, but don't be stupid enough to compare it to Oscar winning performances or expect them to be at that level. The characters do their jobs and are all very likable.Now with the story, basically without many spoilers, the gang is brought together by the murder of a mutual friend. So Brian and Dom work together to find the killer, and to bring down a huge criminal organization. At the same time Brian struggles with his loyalties to his job and to his friends who are on completely different sides of the law, and is forced to make a choice on whether hes a ""good guy playing a bad guy or a bad guy playing a good guy"" (as Mia puts it). So ya its straight forword but a solid plot that really sets up the whole movie, and is not just a completely brainless popcorn flick.All in all Fast and Furious was a very worthwhile movie. In terms of where it stands in the franchise it greatly supasses 2f2f and Tokeyo Drift, and even manages to be as good as or better then the first one in some aspects. If I had to choose Id say the first was better, but this one definitely stands up and is a worthwhile addition to the series. Anyways I give Fast and Furious an 8/10 and totally recommend seeing it in theaters, as it is totally worth $10, and you will only get one chance to see all the action on the big screen where it is at its best.",merce_hoola,2009-04-02,2009,Positive,0.108,0.747,0.146,0.9521
7.0,The best of the series by a mile,"I just got back from the midnight screening of 'Fast & Furious' and I have to admit the movie very much exceeded my fairly low expectations for the film. While the original film was entertaining, it was never a good movie by any means. Let's not even get started on the two that followed. The fourth installment however, is another story. Most of the original cast has come back and seeing them back in action together really makes you realize the F&F franchise isn't the same without them. The chemistry between the three leads (Diesel, Walker and Brewster) is the strongest it's been yet, and I would dare to call several of the scenes 'moving' as a result. Who would have ever expected that from Fast & Furious. The movie does an excellent job of keeping you on the edge of your seat, there's no shortage of action and a story that keeps your attention. The movie starts out in the DR with Vin Diesel pulling off a fairly implausible heist of hijacking a fuel tanker with his new crew. Minutes later, we learn of Letty's murder which in turn basically sets the tone for the rest of the movie as Diesel sets off on an all out rampage to even the score. Like the previous three, you certainly need to suspend your disbelief for the duration of the movie, however I was glad to see they didn't go overboard and kept the special effects and CIG to what seemed like a happy minimum. Anyone who's ever been a fan of the Fast and the Furious series will absolutely need to go see this on the big screen. Even if you weren't so hot for the originals, the movie is still worth a look. In my opinion it's acting, story, plot, special effects are the best of the series so far and almost makes it stand out as a respectable movie. Better yet, they've left the door wide open for 'Fast & Furious 5'. To be continued...",phatrick88,2009-04-02,2009,Positive,0.068,0.799,0.133,0.9652

10.0,Fast & Furious 2.5,"I have read all previous comments and only see a couple of people that actually make a comment that it is supposed to happen between 2 Fast 2 Furious and Tokyo Drift... I'm sure this had something to do with Justin Lin directing Tokyo Drift as well as Fast & Furious. I'm glad that he made it happen that way because I am sure there were many people that saw Tokyo Drift and thought, ""Where did this movie come from?"" It was so random to have it be a Fast and Furious movie when it had nothing to do with either of the original 2 with the exception of the again, random, cameo of Dom at the end of it. In the first couple of scenes of Fast & Furious you see that Han is part of Dom's crew that hi-jacks gas tankers in the Dominican Republic. When the heat is on Dom once again, he tells Han it's time to go do his own thing. Han tells him that he hears of some things going on in Tokyo. If you recall in Tokyo drift, Han tells Sean that Tokyo is his ""Mexico"" he was running to stay out of jail.I really enjoyed this movie. The plot wasn't as detailed as the previous but it followed along well with what you think might happen in a Fast & Furious movie... Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner again, he is still working law enforcement, although this time he is big boy FBI. Vin Deisel is back as Dominic Toretto. He and Brian are trying to get in with a drug ring for different reasons, but team up to help each other get what they are after.The movie is full of everything you expect from the franchise: Nice cars, great racing, hot women and hot guys (to suit everyone's taste) This movie has great action sequences as well. I recommend this movie to anyone that has followed the other 3... or at least the first 2.

6.0,More fun with horsepower,"This fourth entry in the tough-guy, street-racer, busty-babe franchise is, and is not, worthy of the first. It's brought back the original actors, and they still look good. It's got at least one of the original street races. But now, as the opening sequence shows, it's joined the blockbuster rush and shifted over into a CGI-world of preposterously extravagant video-game car events. This intro is like the overkill prelude of 'Quantum of Solace.' Both movies show a trend toward numbing their audiences out with speed and violence in the opening shots, instead of quietly warming them up. It's not a good strategy. 'Fast & Furious' is replete with action that's neither credible nor as integral to the plot as it ought to be, or as the action was in the first in the series, Rob Cohen's 'The Fast and the Furious' (2001), which itself was a glossier reimagining of the kind of cheapie Fifties and Sixties fast-car movies Tarantino plays with in 'Death Proof.' But this one's still got tough guys and busty babes. It's got colorful muscle cars for hot-rodders to drool over. And it's got bright, clear images that are often beautiful. Though they don't quite offset the choppy editing, they punctuate it in an esthetically pleasing way.In the first film Dom (Vin Diesel) disappeared into Mexico. Diesel missed the second episode, seemingly holding out for better career opportunities that didn't quite materialize. His big star vehicle, the 2002 'xXx,' was a bust, despite the presence of B-picture diva Asia Argento. He did star in Sidney Lumet's quirky trial drama, 'Find Me Guilty', if anybody remembers. Having reappeared in episode three, Tokyo Drift (like this directed by Justin Lin), Dom's now living in the Dominican Republic with his girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez). (Note for devotees: in time this new movie fits between episodes three and four.) It's Dom and Letty in the opening frames, stealing a multiple-unit truckload of oil. But their trickery defies the laws of physics and human dexterity too much to matter, even if it weren't too soon to get our adrenalin to pump that hard. Vin's still as muscled and macho; he was lumpen before; now he's just a little thicker. So is his delivery of dialogue, which now has an extra half-second delay. But there's something that makes it hard not to like Vin.Paul Walker (as Brian O'Connor) is similarly likable, with a prettier face. He doesn't have the bottle-blond golden boy look of the original 'The Fast and the Furious,' but he still has a square-jawed, sterling quality mingled with toughness that suits his role here as, now, a cop who turns rogue (or a rogue turned cop; he's not sure) aiming to serve higher ends--but unwilling to betray his old street-racing, law-breaking buddies. He aims to catch a drug kingpin his police boss seems content to let by, but he's forever loyal to Dom.Walker, like Diesel, has star quality, though he too has not exactly had a blockbuster career. He did, however, star in the mind-bendingly over-the-top action flick 'Running Scared,' and got to play the martyred Marine platoon leader in Eastwood's 'Flags of Our Fathers.' Though the plot of 'Fast & Furious' may not always serve Walker and Diesel as well as it should, there's an authenticity about their line delivery still that puts across the myth of their camaraderie and loyalty to a code that Dom has, and Brian is still working on.At least the movie has the sense to make the opening hijack attempt a failure. It leads Dom to go and hide out in L.A. with his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster), who used to be Brian's girlfriend. That flame, predictably, is easily reignited when the plot needs a romantic boost.In the street race sequence, Dom has a GPS screen with a woman's soothing voice (that of Gal Gadot, an exotic new addition to the femmes list) to show the big boy and us where he is in his trajectory. This shows the influence of Paul WS Anderson's 'Death Race,' which took the car race genre up a notch. Alas, though, the slick technology takes us further away from the personal, homemade quality of street racing, which in the first episode was about horsepower and garage work and macho taunts, not visual stunts and hi tech screens. Despite all the crashes (more often head-over-heels than in real life) these movies make racing on the roads look safer than it should, which is why this movie has a detailed ""DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME"" disclaimer at the end. (And there is stunt driving in this movie, even though it's undercut by the CGI tricks.) You'd better believe that warning. Better not to drive at top speed into a half-shut Mexican mountain tunnel. And don't try catching a guy your pal has just dropped out a window, either.It remains to be seen if this movie, which is still fun and fast, helps Diesel and Walker on to the star rules they may deserve, or, what seems equally possible, just sidetracks them further. Lovers of the franchise are not going to be howling with disappointment, but new converts at this stage seem unlikely.",Chris Knipp,2009-04-03,2009,Positive,0.108,0.779,0.112,0.4905
6.0,Fast...but not so Furious,"The fourth film in the series, Fast & Furious is full of action but misses the mark once again. In my opinion, the film is much better than the previous two, as the original cast including Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, and Michelle Rodriquez return. However, something has not returned from the original and that is the CARS. I could count the number of cars that interested me on one hand, and that is not a good thing. And once again, Paul Walker is driving a skyline and Vin Diesel is driving his American muscle. Come on where is the new stuff? Walker is an FBI agent and Diesel is his typical outlaw self. Both work together in bringing down one of the most powerful drug dealers in the country and they do a great job. The movie is full of action, with multiple entertaining action scenes. But what is missing are the most important factors of a Fast and Furious movie: street racing, tuners, and a plot people can actually relate with. The first film was so popular because, although it was a box office movie, it was full of real people and their actual cars. Fast and Furious 4 is too unrealistic with too much CGI...the director should have gone back to the roots of street racing.",Magalhaes9,2009-04-03,2009,Positive,0.078,0.769,0.152,0.9663
7.0,Better than the 1st movie,"I just saw this and to be honest I was hesitant in buying the $8 matinée ticket but wanted to see a movie and figured what the heck. First of all the 1st film was good, IMO the sequel and then Tokyo Drift were pretty bad but the 4th installment gave a ray of hope when I first saw the trailer. I liked the fact that it had a large part of the original cast.I enjoyed this film and was surprised. They actually wrote a good story and it flowed very well, the action and driving scene's were shot and edited superbly, you did get the feeling that you were in the car at times which adds to the intensity of the driving scenes. I also like the fact that they incorporated American muscle cars instead of just imports this way the movie will appeal to people of all tastes.

7.0,"Thumbs up for Laz Alonzo, but ya gotta show more of the ladies!","Okay world, we have a new bad guy, a new nemesis, a new Hollywood heavy, Fenix Rise played by Laz Alonzo. Although billed as a supporting cast member, Mr. Alonzo carries this movie. He saves this otherwise routine action movie from cinematic complacency. The movie has a flimsy story, a ridiculous plot, and good if not exceptional acting from the two leads. Vin Diesel is always wonderful, but he's not the same great character from the original. However, the beautiful Jordana Brewster gives a credible performance but the incredible Michelle Rodriguez is practically no where to be found, which further weakens the movie. Why Ms. Rodriguez is given so little play is puzzling and her absence lowers the temperature of this movie by several degrees. Actresses like Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster are meant to be seen and admired, so, Hollywood, please showcase them because they are wonderful ... and hot.",PWNYCNY,2009-04-03,2009,Positive,0.086,0.717,0.197,0.9663
6.0,Don't waste your money,"I just wasted 2 hours of my live and $8 watching this piece of crap film. The only thing that kept me in my seat until the end was my love of the original F&F movie. I was glad that this one brought back the original cast, but seriously - the writers and directors of this one should be shot, along with the makers of that lame ass Tokyo Drift"". The acting was so beyond bad that I couldn't watch at times. One car race scene (in the city) was awesome, but the rest of the movie just looked like a cheap James Bond / Jason Bourne ripoff. Don't waste your money on this one, wait until it comes out on DVD and then you can watch it at home and make all the fun you want of it!",amanda_n_byrum,2009-04-03,2009,Positive,0.115,0.731,0.153,0.6622
7.0,A Nutshell Review: Fast & Furious,"The tagline caught my attention, promising a brand new movie with the original cast of Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster. With the relative box office success of the first film, the sequel 2 Fast 2 Furious saw only Walker returning, with Tyrese trying very hard to step into the big frame of Diesel's without much success. Tokyo Drift picked up the adrenaline from the East's Initial D, injecting the franchise with some Asian flavour, though the only good thing out of that was the introduction of Sung Kang's character Han. So the 4th movie tries to bring together all the best characters to appease fans, and the timeline of this installment sits snugly in between the first and second movies where we learn that Han and Toretto do go all the way back together. Perfect.Vin Diesel had The Fast and the Furious back in 2001 to thank for in making him a household name, where every fan boy out there left the theatres chanting his name and wishing they could emulate his road stunts if given a car as powerful as that in the film. However we know how he turned his back on a franchise, and how his film career had turned out recently, with stinkers such as Babylon A.D. crowding out his filmography. If he's sorely in need of a return to form, then I guess it doesn't take much rocket science to figure out that he would be tempted to return to his Dominic Toretto roots after his cameo in Tokyo Drift.It was smart of Justin Lin to have featured Torretto in his film then just to whet the appetites of fans everywhere, and to helm this installment by trying to top the first film by getting the first cast all back. However, some parts do get rusty after so long, and in wanting to stamp his authority over the original, had made some drastic decisions in order to keep the engine fine tuned and purring. Since it's before the second movie, Toretto is still an outlaw, and Paul Waker's Brian O'Conner is now working for the FBI, before his unexplained turn to crime in 2 Fast 2 Furious, which gets explained here, if you wish of course.The plot doesn't drift away from the standard cop-robber formula, with a cat and mouse game brewing involving a drug run from Mexico and the USA making use of expert drivers to be couriers between the two countries. And when murder is in the name of the game, Toretto gets involved for vengeance, and O'Conner, well, just doing his job. It's just an excuse to see the Diesel-Walker team up, and the franchise's formula dictates plenty of random scantily clad girls gyrating in front of the camera, while hot cars with modified engines gleam seductively under dim garages, and the screeching of tyres when tearing up the roads.If a race movie is not your cup of tea (after so many copycats have come out to milk fans of the genre), then this franchise offers nothing new. Granted that Hollywood doesn't do car chases like it used to, relying a lot now on plenty of computer animation and graphics to spice up the sequences and entertain. Those itching to see a lot of action will have to contend with only 4 major set action pieces, with 2 of which happen in the same tunnel, one bringing back memories from the first film in a heist that doesn't go exactly right, and one being the nod back to Tokyo Drift in having a downtown city area night time race.Fans of the franchise will still find this a worthy addition, but everyone else would wonder why the effort. If this film continues to make money, I won't be surprised if the next film picks up from where Tokyo Drift left off, maybe with the return of Lucas Black's Sean Boswell joining the new crew in a new adventure, with new cars to smash, new babes to romance, and more nitro to burn up the tracks.",DICK STEEL,2009-04-03,2009,Positive,0.029,0.907,0.064,0.9386

Vin Diesel and Paul Walker deliver superb performances. Diesel in is top from, while Walker plays his part effortlessly. The chicks are decent.Minuses: The twist in the tale, arrives to early.

3.0,Slow and Plodding!,"Really, Fast & Furious is plain misleading, the title should have been Slow n Plodding. What an absolute drag.Exhibit A - Directionless director. With random hand-held camera, incredibly jerky footage, fast cuts all over, you never really get to see anything good. Of the cars at least. The races seemed like they were directed by Michael Bay. Every thing kept exploding and crashing. It was horrible!Exhibit B - Dom's double chin. Humungous, monstrous double chin. Bigger than his bald head. A mutant double chin. His evil doppleganger, even. Sure, I'm being superficial here, but it's a movie, and your job is to look good. Dom is tough muscle-head. A double chin just looks plain ugly!Exhibit C - The story. I think there was one, but I could be wrong.What was real good to see on the screen was some very nice mid-riff closeups of Michelle Rodriguez. Plus that other skank who shows up halfway through the movie, falls for Dom, and thrusts her real hard nipples towards him. He still turns her down.

7.0,"All Told a Good, Enjoyable Entry","It goes without saying that the Fast and Furious franchise hasn't had a good run with the critics. Yet the films have had a mostly fair run at the box office, so they've gradually been released. The first entry is almost unanimously regarded as the best in the series while the second and third are typically frowned upon. For my two cents, the first and third are about equal while the second is best kept as a distant, forgettable memory. Given that this film is coming from Justin Lin, who directed Tokyo Drift, the least that should be expected are some well shot action scenes involving cars. Though enthusiasts of the series will also be looking for satisfaction to the story as well. Does it succeed? Yes, in most ways. The film opens with a bang as Dom, Han (from Tokyo Drift) and a couple other unknowns to the series attempt to steal some gas tank trailers off of a truck which, needless to say, doesn't go without a hitch. After this and a quickly filled in plot piece, we find out that Letty gets murdered and Dom naturally seeks revenge and returns to the U.S. With this and a current assignment, Brian O'Connor (from the first two films) is brought into the mix as he attempts to go after the same people Dom hunts down. The premise is decent enough with skepticisms and indecisiveness playing a large role between the characters. Speaking of the characters, one area of concern fans of the series might have is how well they're still executed and fleshed out after nearly ten year absence from each other (in regards to the film's release dates). Fortunately, the main cast mostly pulled off fair enough performances to stay convincing enough, though it isn't without some melodrama here and there. Fortunately, these moments aren't too frequent and don't hinder the film all that much. Diesel manages to pull of the usual 'just decent' performance that he's had in practically all of his films. Walker actually feels like the most fleshed out character and comes off as a better performer than Vin. As for the supporting cast, they're all just fair at best, with only one or two performances any better than that. But since this film is called ‘Fast and Furious’ and is part of that very franchise, what most people will likely expect going in is for it to be, well, fast and furious. In this sense, the film does succeed quite well. Credit definitely has to be given to Lin for the action scenes involving the cars. The action in these parts are frantic and very exciting, with plenty of awesome, speeding cars to add adrenaline to these scenes. If there's anything you'll want to do at the end of the film, it'll be to get in your car and start shattering the speed limits. What Fast and Furious does best is give you an adrenaline rush during its action scenes. The film lives up to its name and will give those wanting some great car action sequences something to enjoy. When action isn't the focus of the film, it's far easier to find issues and be a bit turned off. But if you're a series fan you should be able to enjoy most of what the film offers and will likely walk away quite satisfied as I did. The first and third films are still my favorites in the series, but this installment is about as good as the first film and is miles above the laughable 2 Fast 2 Furious.",Hellrazr360,2009-04-03,2009,Positive,0.051,0.798,0.152,0.9962
2.0,Review of the 4th and Comments on the F&F Series as a whole,"No doubt they will be making a 5th as these movies are cheap enough to make and still moderately successful with the built in fan base. I say with the built in fan base because, with the lack believability of the 3rd one and the 4th one, no one but the rice boys would want to see a 5th one!!! I could write a better script and be a better director than Lin ever thought of being (remember interview where he said he was not a car guy)!!! The 3rd one was just stupid as it was so unrealistic and had no real character development; it just seemed to be a stereotypically western view of Japan. Yakuza and drifting, sure FF4 is just too slow at the start, feeling more like a bad episode of ""Cops"" or something. It was just kind of boring, and it was not like there was any real character development. And, as usual (except for the FF2 to a degree; i.e. FF2 was kind of like Miami Vice), there was no real believable plot; using a secret tunnel and street racers to smuggle drugs, sure, whatever... The races in the movie were just far to scattered, like they wanted to make this a movie about everything except the cars, heck they only showed an R35 once that I could tell (the red car on the screen when Brain is selecting his car) and used the R34 a few times. It felt like it just went on-and-on with its bad take on a cop drama. I was ready to leave before the ending credits, sad... It really felt like they wanted to have some type of one dimensional character development, like they wanted to make a serious work, but it fails at that. It also tries to tie up the ""loose ends"" as they stated they would do, but again, I don't think they should have tried. And Brain back with the FBI, what was with that? I thought that at the end of the 2nd one he was going to open up a tuning garage, what happened? Heck, that could have been more interesting; Brain gets involved with something that has to do with his new tuning shop and some kind of, well heck, organized crime (yes, that does seem to be the only answer the script writers have with this series of movies as a plot engine)! And of course, the end of FF4 works perfectly into the soon-to-be 5th installment! I see it; now Dominic and Brain must flee the USA to Europe and get involved in stopping the smuggling of, you know it, drugs! Oh, and Universal, if you want someone who can really make a real car movie, see me",roadbuster-1,2009-04-03,2009,Positive,0.103,0.762,0.135,0.9476

I'm not sure how anyone could down rate this movie unless they actually are intending to. You know what your going to go see when you go to see a title like this. I was pleasantly surprised.

If you compare all releases on Fast and Furious, the 1st Installation still rocks! Then after that comes FF4, then Tokyo Drift and the least exciting was the second part. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) crazily kept on changing his mind which route to take while driving. He did this all the time in the movie. If he reached a dead-end, he quickly routed his car to a new path. Amazing ! The only thing which I think had potential was when they come to rescue Vin Diesel in the end. The writers could have kept it for the next installation along with a fast-on-feet, jailbreak chase sequence. Very few street races, Amazing Direction, very few scenes for Michelle (Laticia/Letty). I feel a bit cheated because I expected to watch Jordana Brewster (Mia) who had not many scenes in the movie. Definitely a good watch!",quaker-9,2009-04-03,2009,Negative,0.106,0.809,0.084,-0.6912
10.0,A reunion thats worth attending.,"The first Fast and the furious movie was something like a phenomenon for me as a teenager. It had amazing cars, gorgeous girls and introduced two stars to the mainstream audience, Paul Walker & Vin Diesel. The second film only brought back one of them..and while it wasn't terrible, the vibe and energy from the first seemed to be drained out due to this actors presence missing. I wont even begin to explain my disliking of the third film aside from its direction, because we would be here for hours. Finally, for whatever reason, maybe money, maybe careers not going where they were supposed to, these two guys came back together along with their love interests from the first film..and I, for one, am happy that it went down. The action sequences are top notch, easily the best in the series. The cars are AMAZING..if you are a car guy you will flat out love the choices in the film. The acting is..well, tolerable. I read reviews for this film laughing out loud. It sounded like critics were expecting Slumdog Millionaire. Come on people..its the fast and the furious. It is supposed to be fun, loud and exciting. Not Oscar worthy. I don't want to give away anything like most reviews do because i know fans of the series would rather see it for themselves. It is satisfying and i would say, almost as good as the original. For its action sequences, pace and overall feel..i give the film a 10/10.",furiousneon,2009-04-03,2009,Positive,0.067,0.735,0.198,0.9905
8.0,"A Fun, Fast Ride!","While this second movie of Vin Diesel's ‘Fast and Furious’ Trilogy did not impress me as much as its predecessor, ‘The Fast and The Furious’  did, it was definitely worth my money and time, I thoroughly enjoyed every speeding second! The film will meet your expectations of a good plot, witty humor, fast cars, sexy people and down-to-earth fun, and might even have you gripping your seat in a few of the fast-paced driving scenes. While this second movie does not have as many awesome cars as the first film, ‘The Fast and the Furious’ did, it still keeps you wanting more of the unbelievable yet awesomely choreographed driving and action sequences it boasts throughout the entire movie.

10.0,Great Movie.....Feed the need for Speed,"This is a great movie. Vin and Paul come back, Michelle and Jordana are still there it was great to pick up where everyone else left off at. Sure that in the time since Brian (Walker) had found out that its been Dom (Diesel) ripping off the trucks that he had gone off to Miami to bring in drug lord and recover missing money. Then the whole series takes off to Tokyo where it had nothing to do with the original cast or the original plot. Dom is kicking it down in the Dominican Republic with Letty (Rodriguez) pulling the same stuff they did in L.A. Dom leaves to save Letty but she ends up getting murdered by the new gang in town headed by a Columbian drug Cartel. The Charger/Challenger (not sure which one Dom has) makes it comeback only to get destroyed once more. Other than the typical Brian working for the government to bring in the bad guy and having a love affair with Mia (Brewster) in the process while still trying to save Dom...this movie was great.

Then you see Dom on a prison bus, but behind it you see 4 tuned up cars racing up behind the bus. Then it shows O'Conner and Doms sister, and a few other people. Then the movie ends.

Forget what you know about the franchise, if you want an ADRENALINE rush it'll be TOO LARGE! You can say what you want about ALL THE originals coming back, but you know what they're a team and they bring out the BEST in each other every time. It's FANTASTIC to see Vin Diesel (DOM), Michelle Rodriguez (Letty), Paul Walker (Brian), & Jordana Brewster (Mia) all reprising roles that brought your attention to them in the first movie. I love that we're in 2009 and technology has brought movies to such amazingly great speeds & heights. I've never seen it used more brilliantly then this is 2 and a half hour thrill ride. Dom's on the run, Brian's back with the FBI, and Mia's holding down the home front back in Cali. Well it wouldn't be a reunion if they all didn't come collide back together in misfortune,racing, and the world's BIGGEST drug trafficker. It just wouldn't be FAST and FURIOUS.

This seems to be the proper sequel to 2001 movie with all of the original cast. Yeah, this seems to be the best of the series. It has some of the best car chase scenes in the movies and the story is thrilling with suspense.The story: This has an actual story that manages to thrill unlike the previous sequel. Paul Walker and Vin Diesel are back to lead in the movie. Can't say much about the story, but it does pack some thrills and suspense with car racing/chasing scenes. There is nothing special about the story but it is at least entertaining and thrilling. Those who just get the thrill in seeing beautiful and sexy cars being smashed, this one don't disappoint. Cars toppling onto each other, cars smashing into each other. Plus there are hot babes. Looks good, right? Overall: Those who love the Fast and Furious series should obviously catch this one.

Lots of cheesy 1 liners, Lots of cheesy explosions, tons of references back to the first Fast and the furious, and lots of pretty sweet cars driving terribly doing absurd things.

Even to the car guy this movie is a complete joke, albeit a hilarious one. STi's without drive shafts, AWD cars doing RWD burnouts, and the list goes on with mishaps even with the subject matter.

Then to kick it off and give the movie a plot, Vin Diesels girlfriend gets killed off. They really thought this one through, this time. The action is great. Amazing cars and high flying.

6.0,Slow & Tedious,"The general plot of the movie goes something like this: Dom (Vin Diesel) and his buds are at it again and stealing gas from poor South-American countries (I would like to think that they're doing this to destabilize a government that is based solely on irony). However, Dom realizes he can't mess with the feds that are out to get him, so naturally he takes to the road and gets the hell out of Dodge. But not for long, since a plot device that we were SO not expecting brings him to good old L.A., and by complete coincidence, in the middle of an FBI operation that has to take down a drug lord. We are told that this drug lord effectively manages to smuggle more dope than Escobar did in 10 years. While that in it's own right would just have to be pretty freaking awesome, we have to remember the fact that Escobar was responsible for about 80% of the drugs coming in and out of America in his time. Which kind of makes it obvious that this new drug lord would have to effectively control either half the U.S. fleet or literally be able to s**t transports on a daily basis... However, the movie wants to make us believe that he can do so with 4 guys a night, racing through a tunnel that just happens to be outside of the Mexican border's scanners, all the while running down from Mexico to America... Of course no one would think to post sentries there...As it turns out, Dom and Walker (Brian O'Conner) end up working on the same case, albeit for totally different reasons. In the end we get a plot twist that we SO didn't see coming, and an ending that just screams for another sequel to be made. Normally I'd say HELL YES! to something like that, if the movie had been what I expected. Read what follows to see why my response was something more on the lines of ""I'll see another one of these if you guys let me in for free. And give me hot chicks... or at least a free soda."".Why directors will choose to take the fun out of an otherwise brainless movie is something that will always manage to elude me. It somehow falls into the same category as things like why I can never find magical leprechauns that will hand me money or why some studios green-light scripts that smell of brain-fart from a mile away.I mean... I can totally understand that the movie chooses to pimp slap reality while screaming ""Who's your driver daddy!"" (I sometimes like to believe that it also throws in a sucker-punch every now and then), because that's what makes it fun. But then again, if you walk into a ""Fast & Furious"" movie expecting realism, you probably deserve the aforementioned treatment yourself... applied by Gremlins (because we all know how terrifying a Gremlin screaming ""Who's your daddy"" would be).Just to get this out of the way, I like cars. I love tuned cars. I love hot women that choose to wear belts as skirts, or wear dresses that don't have enough material to cover up 30% of their body. And if the movie had 90% of that and the rest had been composed entirely of Vin Diesel kicking a** and taking names while displaying absolutely no remorse or guilt, then I would have loved this movie. So much so, that I probably would have given it a 10 just for being composed of THAT much awesome (ok maybe a 9 because it just wouldn't have been in the same class of awesome as ""The Dark Knight""... unless one of the racing cars was the Batmobile, and the chicks around Batman had been dressed in Catwoman outfits).But no... instead we get 30% car racing and general bad-a**, 20% of Vin Diesel looking as if he's about to s**t bricks considering how muscularly constipated he looks, coupled with general bad-a**, and 50% I'm-sorry-for-banging-your-sister-and-then-taking-off-without-even leaving-a-note tear-jerking dialog that was hackneyed at best and cringe-worthy at worst. It basically sounded like a rejected sketch for a James Bond movie in which Sean Connery starts telling his newly acquired babe that it's too dangerous for her to stay around him, because he's got like... ninjas after him... or something. The reasons why that wouldn't stick are: 1. Sean Connery's brass testicles wouldn't allow him to utter such a thing.2. We all know James Bond probably doesn't care all that much.3. We all know WE wouldn't care all that much.In this case, reasons 1 and 3 apply more than ever. Why? Could it have to do with the fact that we get to know so little of the characters that we utterly can not give less of a rat's a** about them? Bingo! Because seriously... I didn't pay the admission price to weep at tear-jerking drama. I paid to watch fast cars and hot chicks. If I want depth, I'll watch ""Slumdog Millionaire"" or ""The Wrestler"", or ""Seven Pounds"". If I want hot spoilers and rims, and cars that have jet-engines put in them I'll probably just play Need for Speed.

8.0,"All you need from an action movie.. engines, explosions and Vin Diesel",This movie picks up from where the first movie left off. Dominic(Vin Diesel) and Letty(Michelle Rodriguez) are hiding pulling jobs just for the fun of it but Dom knows that none's safe around him and decides to leave Letty. In the city FBI is trying to get their hands on the Drug-lord (Campos) and Brian (Paul Walker) is on the hunt. Letty makes a deal with Brian to cleanse Dom of all charges and in turn go in undercover as an informant. A job goes bad and she gets killed by the bad guy (Fenix) who works for Campos. Dom goes hungry for revenge and is back on the streets looking for the killer. Brian and Dom team up in catching these bad guys and of course Dom kills Felix. In between all this plot is extreme street racing with big engines and loads of action. The movie is well directed and fully satiates your hunger for action adventure and speeding cars. I just loved the first movie so i always wanted the same cast appearing again and thankfully this one didn't disappoint. Vin Diesel is as good as ever.. his screen presence is phenomenal and rest of the cast is great too. I quite liked the opening car race sequence and the rest of the movie was good enough to keep me glued to the chair. Well in the end Dom gets a trial and Brian as an FBI officer testifies and pleads for dropping of all charges but court finds him guilty and sentences 25 years. Brian and Dom's sister get furious with all this and try to get Dom out and thats where it ends. Another open ending for a possible sequel which makes everyone happy i guess.,WalkThatTalk,2009-04-04,2009,Negative,0.151,0.713,0.136,-0.8234
10.0,Great Re-invention of the F&F,"Don't Liston to the Bull from haters. This is a GREAT Movie for the Action racer at heart. It's not about heavy story line or great dialog. It's about the code of friendship, and fast cars with big mucilage.enjoy with that attitude and you will end felling faster and with more ferocity in life.I myself have a 1989 5.0 Mustang and I have it done to the Tees! every time I step into it it relaxes me and to see this movie makes me appreciate it even more. This movie is not about racing it's about a love for a great gift .the gift to make a great car fell like part of the family",merlin6-2,2009-04-04,2009,Positive,0.035,0.681,0.285,0.9899
10.0,Well worth the $6.50 that I spent at the matinée.,"For one thing? There was the action-packed prologue. It had stunt work worthy of a James Bond movie. And, more importantly, it had a rare case of faithful continuity. Not only did Michelle Rodriguez return to play Letty. Sun Kang (as Han) was back, too!* *Making it appear that it was set a year or two before F&F: TOKYO DRIFT. Another thing this sequel had going for it was the return of Paul Walker, as Brian, and Jordana Brewster as Dom's sister, Mia. Eva Mendes was undeniably nice to look at, in 2F/2F. And, I'm sure, as Agent Fuentes, she provided a great release for any sexual tension Brian might have felt. But, Brian and Mia had much better chemistry! They proved this when they had their dramatic reunion in that little diner. I was wondering what he'd say when she demanded an explanation for his emotional betrayal of her. And, I was not disappointed. As far as I'm concerned, Brian's reply was delivered with complete believability! Of course, the _best_ thing this sequel had going for it was the return of Vin Diesel to straightforward action-adventure! Oh, he proved he could do light-hearted, family-friendly spoofs of it in the Disney flick, THE PACIFIER. But, I suspect the main reason he appeared in that film was just for the sake of professional variety. To prove he wasn't just a Right Said Fred look-alike who could take a punch (and dish it back out, twice as hard). So, if you haven't already seen it, go for it. The only way you could dislike it is if you disliked the first three movies in the franchise, as well.",Carycomic,2009-04-04,2009,Positive,0.08,0.817,0.103,0.7388
8.0,Strong sequel in a great movie series!,"Fast & Furious shows originality far beyond it's title, enough to put it on top of the series with the first. 2F2F was a decent sequel, but definitely was not an ending point. TD was funny, entertaining, and gripping, but once again was not a good ending point for the series. F&F was a GREAT addition to the series. Enough girls, plenty of fast cars, some good one-liners, good action, awesome driving, great stunts, and an awesome cast. This one had more than enough badass-ery to satisfy me. Overall, I went in expecting something like TD, but came out amazed. Any fan of the series will absolutely love F&F! Some gripes: 1) I was disappointed Han didn't have more of a role, I really liked his style in Tokyo Drift. 2) The GPS-Nav thing added nothing to the movie, it was just some stupid Hollywood cheese that had wayyy too much of a part in the movie. 3) During the race-in, Brian was driving parallel to Dom on the dirt road, then at the end of the road he drove down the embankment to catch up with Dom.... WTF?!??!?! That was a PRIME moment to do an epic jump. 4) I thought Lil Wayne had a cameo.....",Bigbadboy701,2009-04-05,2009,Positive,0.084,0.662,0.254,0.9947
9.0,Return to be Fast & Furious,"Great to see the four main cast members return for Fast & Furious which has Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto,Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner, Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto and Michelle Rodriguez as Letty. Great to see the series go back to the way it started to bring fans of cars to come see a awesome movie series since The Fast And The Furious came to the box offices in 2001. I have seen all the Fast And The Furious movie and this throw The third movie in the series out the window. The action and cars in Fast & Furious are much improve and kick butt beyond that. The Story has more twist and turns then the others, Dominic is out for revenge and later by a now back in the F.B.I. Brain joins in undercover while trying to rebuild a old love with Mia who he loved in The Fast and the Furious. I like that the writers set up the story so well and make it where you never knew what happens next it just that good. All the cars are awesome from all kinds of Car companies such as GM, FORD, HONDA, TOYOTA, DODGE, and so forth. They really took the Furious and put it into Fast & Furious. If you have not seen this movie yet you must see it it helps rebuild the series and I hope we get another Fast & Furious movie soon enough because this movie helps the movie survive I give Fast & Furious a 9 out of ten A lot has chance, You're right",Terryfan,2009-04-05,2009,Positive,0.127,0.733,0.14,0.5069

7.0,a great addition to the nothing special genre,"Brian O'Conner is now a federal agent (?) and drawn back into his past when he's unexpectedly reunited with former prey Dominic Toretto (Diesel) while in pursuit of an infamous drug smuggler, the very same smuggler with whom Toretto has his very own personal score to settle. Despite the circumstances, and their prior history, the two reluctantly decide to work together to bring the lowlife down. Silly, clichéd sequel has the expected high-octane action sequences, but suffers from shallow characters, crummy dialogue, weak acting, and a ridiculous story. The reunion of stars Diesel and Walker who kick-started the franchise adds no flare whatsoever to the tepid proceedings, but undiscriminating action fans may not mind. *½",Special-K88,2009-04-05,2009,Negative,0.166,0.826,0.008,-0.9595
8.0,"Not a bad entry, way better than 2 Fast 2 Furious","Okay, I love this series. It has good looking, along with fast cars, decent performances, and interesting back stories. Fast and Furious is sort of a mix between the last three entries, and that is where this one will either make or lose an audience.The past three were about showing off both tuner and muscle cars while putting them in some very cool situations. The first two were about plain drag and street racing, while Tokyo Drift was about drifting with a couple of street races thrown in for good measure. This one again mixes all three together. In one showcase scene, four racers are scrambling to make it to be the first across the finish line about five miles down the road. They are racing past, into, and around oncoming traffic using street racing and drifting tactics. However, my only gripe about the cars is that they don't seem to be top focus here. Don't get me wrong, Dom's Charger and Bryan trademark car from 2F2F, the Skyline, is back, along with some other cool automotive toys, but aren't used to the effect of the first three.Where this movie shines is in it's presentation. This Fast and Furious is focused on and has, wait for it, a good story fueling (excuse the bad pun) this entry. While nowhere near Oscar or the Academy Awards material, this is fan service to every extent of the meaning. Jordana Brewster, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Vin Diesel, and even Sung Kang (as Han), return for this movie, along with giving decent performances While definitely continuing the story of the first, I didn't hear any references to the events of 2F2F. I'm wondering if they know themselves that that one was a mistake? BTW, this story takes place between 2F2F and Tokyo Drift, if Han returning wasn't any indication.Overall, fans of the series should like this one, and ranks right up there with the first and Tokyo Drift. If you are not a fan, don't go in thinking this movie is going to be revolutionary or extraordinary, like critics. Instead, just think about having fun watching an action packed thrill-ride that is about two hours long.",codehorizon,2009-04-05,2009,Positive,0.058,0.823,0.118,0.96

6.0,Too serious.......,"I got a chance to see the new ""Fast & Furious"" movie this weekend. I gotta say I was expecting a huge blockbuster movie filled with fun and action much like its predecessors. Unfortunately I may have set the bar too high as I was thoroughly disappointed. I have been a huge fan of the ""Fast & Furious"" series for years as they are great for the purpose they were made for: To entertain. I felt that this newest installment took it self a bit too seriously and that it could have used a lot more ""fun"". The feel of the movie was a bit awkward as the cast has not worked together in almost 8 years. It was as if they were uncomfortable coming together again. What I also did not understand is where part 2 fit into this whole equation. It was as if the producers dusted off part 2 as if it never existed. I did like how they linked this movie to part 3(Tokyo Drift) however, as it is my favorite in the series. Overall I would have to give this movie a 6/10. It would probably be lower if I was not a fan of the series and actually cared to see what has happened with it's characters.",xjeffreyxnothing-1,2009-04-06,2009,Positive,0.092,0.752,0.156,0.9445

Fast and Furious: That should have been in Tokyo drifts spot. I find it the best in the series.

5.0,Fasten your seatbelts.,"The latest installment in the high-energy Fast and Furious brings back the original cast to the franchise that made them stars. The result - the strategy paid off, this outing is the best of the sequels, and I find myself wondering whether this is the best F&F movie. It's a good, VERY solid, no-holds-barred action movie.While the plot may be a slight rehash of 2 Fast 2 Furious, it's (mostly) the cars who steal the scene here. Like most of it's predecessors, the cars move through busy streets and off-roads like a hip-hop dancer. Let the cars do the talking, I say. The producers thought it would be a good idea to bring Justin Lin back on board as director after Tokyo Drift, up until now the most carefully shot of the franchise. Well, his kinetic and lively direction paid off, and he's an action director to look out in the future. The cinematography is wide in scope and the editing rarely at times feels rushed and pulls you into the film without force. The music from Brian Tyler (again from Tokyo Drift), also fits the moments. There is a number of action sequences, and while some may find the number of actual illegal street races little (one, in fact) disappointing, fear not, as the other action scenes with cars in them more than make up for it, especially the final action sequences. There are obvious moments of CGI, though, but Lin and his crew pull it off in a way it makes it enjoyable.Most of the actors, for most of the time, do NOT out-act the cars. In fact one returning star's character is underused and another's wasted. But the two REAL leads steal the show (barely) from the automobiles, namely Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto. Since he's producer as well, he makes sure when the cameras are on him, they show his X-factor potential to the fullest. What made Diesel into a bankable action hero is proved here, he has a tough body, a macho voice, and a charming personality to boot. This, is his TRUE comeback to mainstream action after the laughably inept Babylon A.D. Fans of Diesel would be glad to know he's back kicking a lot of ass in the film. It's almost ""The Vin Diesel Kicks Ass Show"". The other actor almost stealing the limelight is Paul Walker, the other lead, who seems to be more aggressive in his role as Brian O' Connor. Who could blame him? The first F&F was meant to make him into a bona-fide star, Vin Diesel stole the limelight from him. This is evident in his post F&F movies (Running Scared (2006), anyone?). Anyway having Vin & Paul back together makes all the difference, as they portray characters in which anyone can root for.So for a fast paced, popcorn munching good time, , buckle up and hang on for a Universal thrill ride. What the story lacks, it more than makes up with it's cast, it's action, and most importantly, it's cars. Girls, cars, and bling, oh my!

The only decent cars in the entire movie are the ones that Dom's sister drives, Dom's dad's car and one that is is shown driven twice my a supporting actor. I feel they went the completely wrong direction with this movie and forgot about what we all go to see Fast & the Furious films for, sick cars and action packed racing. Hopefully they will come out with another one when they have remembered what the movies became famous for. I would not recommend paying to see this in theaters, this is definitely one to rent when it comes out on video and only if you feel like spending a few bucks to see the Vin Deisel/ Paul Walker combination back in action.",RockyReed,2009-04-08,2009,Positive,0.112,0.756,0.131,0.715
4.0,Lives Up To Its Name,"If your taste in film runs to car chases and blood than Fast & Furious will more than live up to its title.

I suppose you will have to have seen that film to understand what's going on here.Vin Diesel as a career criminal and Paul Walker as the LAPD officer working with the FBI to nail Diesel are back again, picking up where they left off. Some really bad blood happened as Walker in the previous film got intimate with Diesel's sister Jordana Brewster. Now however both are after the same man, a criminal kingpin of mysterious origins who has killed Diesel's sister, Michelle Rodriguez.They both go undercover so to speak each not giving the other's game away. These facts are divulged in those precious few moments between car chases, fights, and shootings which come in abundance.Nothing terribly new here, but the ending is absolutely ludicrous, no way Paul Walker trashes his whole career for what he does.",bkoganbing,2009-04-08,2009,Negative,0.123,0.856,0.021,-0.9536
3.0,Definitely Disappointing,"Well, where to begin.... As it might have occurred to you that after seeing a movie you head straight to the toilet in the theatre where people are gathering and waiting in lines, exchanging thoughts about the movie. Actually this time the line was quite long and everybody kept saying the same things. Why do studios always have to make a bad sequel to a great movie (FNF 1)? They wanted to get paid again and again and again? Well, this time the story is over because nobody will want to see the next sequel. I always say to my friends that i can write a better script than this while i am in the bathroom for 5 minutes, and yes, with a cast like this the story should have been MUCH MORE enjoyable, action packed, where the director does not let you breathe (like in the first FNF). Come on, this movie is about cars, the director did not have the first idea about new models (okay, there was one), but that's not even the point. The story should have been! And the characters should have been! Emotions should have been! The movie is all about grief from the beginning, which does not pay well in my opinion. The audience left the theatre without the adrenalin they have paid for, unsatisfied. And in this dangerous financial times it is a huge mistake! The movie has grossed a lot, okay. Because people want to see it with their own eyes that the movie which was great once, went down the gutter, otherwise they won't believe it.

5.0,Disappointing,"I expected big things from this movie, especially with the poster showing all the original movie cast and the exciting trailer. But disappointing is the exact word that describes this movie for me.The story has never been a strong point of the Fast & the Furious series. Well, neither is the acting for that matter. What is most important is the good amount of orgasmic cars and adrenaline pumping racing on show! But the director probably thought they'd try and give the series a new look. Bad idea.Here's why. The story, if you look closely enough, is littered with loopholes and while that is generally overlooked in a F&F movie, it can't be when it is being given a lot of importance. Vin Diesel probably has just two expressions in his repertoire, and he used them to the fullest in this movie, especially when he was in the emotional scenes.Coming to the action. This is where a F&F movie redeems itself. But sadly there is only ONE proper race in this movie, and 3 other action sequences with cars. Which is disappointing to say the least! When people think about this series, its all about the cars and the racing. But apparently it wasn't for this movie. Even Paul Walker's good guy-tough cop routine couldn't save this movie.I'm a big fan of the series, and if this movie wouldn't have had the cast, then I would have rated it below Tokyo Drift. But it manages JUST enough to better the previous installment. If this would have been some other movie and not a F&F sequel, I probably would have rated it higher.

6.0,Same old but slightly enhanced formula.,"Fast & Furious, the fourth in line of the Fast and the Furious franchise, uses the same old formula that makes the first three movies good and then trimmed off the little things that make them bad.The story kicks off with the return of some familiar faces, namely, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his band of brothers – and girlfriend, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) – in an attempt to steal some petrol, in which they succeed. But Dom is a wanted man. And being an honorable wanted man that he is, he left his friends in hope that the cops would come for him instead of them. Skip a few years later, Dom gets a call from his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) telling him that his beloved girlfriend is murdered. And that is generally the plot of this movie: Dom's out to find the person responsible for Letty's death.And then in come another familiar face, the undercover cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), in a very fast and adrenaline-rushed chase scene. That is, on foot and from rooftop to rooftop. That is one of the most exciting scenes in the movie.Brian is on a hunt for a drug-dealer, who is actually the same guy that Dom is trying to find. So they teamed up... just like old times.Fast & Furious is really for fans only. New-comers might not understand the connection between the characters, but the story itself is quite easy to follow, with some surprising twist in the plot.But it was a disappointment to see that some of the action sequences are done in CGI, namely the tunnel scenes. This really takes away the excitement that the first three movies offer. And also, this movie is way too serious. Instead of the cars and races, we're focused on Dom's quest for revenge which could be a drag after a while.If you just let go of the bad dialogues and some plot holes, and probably the lack of action, Fast & Furious is actually not bad. It's still fast and still furious, and with a more matured storyline.But if they're planning for a sequel, I suggest that they get back to the original theme of the franchise, which is racing and cars.",SophomoreSlump,2009-04-09,2009,Neutral,0.116,0.767,0.118,0.0139

9.0,FF 2.5 - the best in the series.,"Though I was extremely excited about this movie coming out, I honestly it would be somewhat disappointing. But I was very surprised. I absolutely loved how they integrated things from the first movie into it; the old house, the old car, even Dom's cross and leather jacket. It basically brought in things from the first and third movie which is great because the second one was crap, in my opinion. This movie was a lot more emotional and serious compared to the others. Vin Diesel did a fantastic job playing the broken-hearted hero with the tough macho exterior. You could really feel his pain. It was better, I think, than his character in 'A Man Apart' in which he was also seeking revenge. I would have really liked to see more of Michelle Rodriguez, though, just so the four main characters could actually be reunited again. And it would have been nice to see more of Sung Kang. He was basically in it for five minutes, said something about Tokyo and then he was gone. They should have delved more into the history that was touched on in Tokyo Drift. The cars used in this one were also great. But like I said before, it feels like this sequel was more concerned with the plot and emotions involved rather than just the action - not to say that the action sequences didn't make me jump a little. The only thing I would complain about is the ending. It was a nice concept because it echoed the beginning, but it left me with the feeling that nothing was solved in the movie because it put them all right back where they started. Overall: great plot, explosive action, hot boys and hot cars - I give this movie 9 out of 10. :)",n_retandy,2009-04-09,2009,Positive,0.065,0.742,0.193,0.9944
8.0,Not much fast but its entertaining,First of all to start with this movie its nice to have a sequel like this actually before going to movie i thought that movie will go of the roofs as many sequels gone but its a far better sequel then other and to come into the movie its once again the movie has some fine cars and babes as well and it has some fine rides too but movie should have more fast suiting to the title and it even lacks in the middle of the movie and on the way coming to the story of the movie it should have been a new one but anyway the visuals are entertaining from first to last and the soundtracks are also fineSO finally every one can have nice moment to watch this movie and enjoy the movie today itself,surendranath,2009-04-09,2009,Positive,0.0,0.831,0.169,0.9761
5.0,a movie as a video-game - or is it the other way around?,"The latest installment in the Fast & Furious saga (instead of giving it a tune-up in terms of a different title, after 2 Fast & 2 Furious and Tokyo Drift, they just removed the ""The"" words to possibly fool certain viewers), starring again Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, functions fairly competently enough as a car chase and/or car driving picture. That it never involved me in terms of its story or characters could be another matter, but it isn't. It's precisely why this movie, for all of its money and care and sense of ""hey, 13 year old boys will go APE over this"", it's got nothing at all that one would not see in a video game.While I might have thought this could have been a deterrent to its box-office potential it is about to cross the 100 million mark with still more to go. And yet I wonder if I am the only one who, within the first sequence if not a little longer into it, could think ""yeah, didn't I just see this in, oh, any given Grand Theft Auto video game""? And the fact is a Grand Theft Auto game is what this movie is: drug dealers, gangsters, super-slick driving with the occasional guiding voice coupled with dialog that in a video game one would just click ahead to go past. Whatever little plot and character development there was in the first film, which certainly had more fun with itself, is given the pits here.For anyone who's had the pleasure of a GTA experience (the best of them, I mean, not the first one which didn't have nearly the fun of III or Vice City) one can ride cars as fast as possible and even let the Id out as much as wanted - you get star ratings for your wanted level, and mission be damned, just have a good time. The failure of Fast & Furious is that for any moment I could try to get into it as entertainment it pulled back into video game territory, and in a millisecond realize the lack of a controller to take over. It's synthetic entertainment ala Transformers, and while Justin Lin is not the caliber of BOOM-EXPLOSIONS ARE SO COOL! filmmaker like Michael Bay he's lost any sense of real interest in what makes a story work well - sad considering his first film, Better Luck Tomorrow, and the underrated Finishing the Game, did very much just that.If you're a hardcore fan of the franchise- and frankly I never met one and am not sure even the ones in the audience were- you'll dig it a lot. For everyone else, stick to the video-games.",Quinoa1984,2009-04-09,2009,Positive,0.06,0.783,0.157,0.9951
10.0,Ummmm,"Whoever review the ""slow and plodding"" thing, needs to be fired/shot/locked away forever, my eyes hurt from reading all the fail he wrote. I don't see anyone of the things he wrote anywhere in the movie, the story isn't hard to figure out, it's a revenge flic. The story was extremely action packed, and didn't stop for a second. If the review guy is into realistic movies with a small amount of action, I suggest he go review some documentaries, try Gran Tornio if you want a ""realistic"" movie. That review was the worst I've ever read, I don't get why he even comments on the lady halfway through the movie's nipples, I guess he was trying to make his review lengthy to make it look readable, regardless of how pathetic it was.",berter122,2009-04-09,2009,Negative,0.123,0.847,0.03,-0.9487
