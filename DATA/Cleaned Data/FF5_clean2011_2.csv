6,7,The first sequel in the series that's actually worth your dollar,"Sure the original was something fresh, new, and somewhat original. But the sequels have been anything but. Yeah i know it's high octane fun, but you can say the same thing about Michael Bay films. Am i saying that these sequels are as bad as Michael Bay films? No, but each one offers nothing new, well, unless you count drifting, and that isn't saying a lot. Hopefull this new installment can bring something fresh to the table.I never thought i would say this, but i actually enjoyed this movie. I went in with low expectations, and came out pretty damn satisfied. Sure the movie had a lot of the same moving parts, but what really made this one stand out is how it actually changed the pace of how they normally do things.First, they didn't have a damn drag race every 10 minutes. In fact, they barely had any. Which really is a genius idea, because when the time did come to have an awesome driving sequence, you were begging for it. Finally, someone with brains stepped into this movie and said let's save all of our bullets and unleash them in the end.So with a series that relies heavily on their driving sequences and less on their script, how do you keep your audience entertained? Well, the first step is to incorporate another major actor, enter The Rock. Next, you really need to buff up your script. Okay, here is where it gets both good and bad. It's good because the movie takes a ton of it's credit from the ""Ocean 11"" films. Yeah, it's stealing an idea, but it injecting more action into it, which is pretty cool. But the reason why i say it's also bad, is because it's still packed with bad cheesy one-liners, poor acting, and some really tarnished plot outlines. But does that take anything away from the fun.......not really.Bottom Line, okay people, here is your first action movie worth seeing this year. No, i am not one of those people who hold these 'Fast and Furious' films on a high pedestal. Not since the first one have i given anything over a decent review. But i can say with confidence that this one is actually worth your hard earned dollar. Sure it's slightly cheesy, packed with impossible action, and sure it steals some plot outlines from other films, but i like i said earlier, it's still fun to watch. So with that being said, the question remains.....is this the best one in the series? I still say no, but this movie comes damn close. Closer that any of the other ones, thats for damn sure. On a time line, this should have followed up the original",blackmambamark,5/1/11,2011
8,7,Best since the original.,"""Home sweet home"" utters Diesel's beefcake criminal Dom Toretto to Walker's baby-faced ex-cop Brian O'Conner as they sit in Toretto's souped up muscle car ready to race along the streets of Rio de Janeiro. There's more than a hint of irony in this; fans of the Fast franchise will know exactly what Dom means. The sequels spawned from the highly successful first film have been a mixed bag appealing to different tastes. Some have been mildly entertaining in their own way, but the one major issue they've all shared is a lack of recurring characters and follow-on narratives. 2009's Fast & Furious partially rectified that by having the main four from the original movie return, but it's this fifth entry that really starts to bring the whole series together.There's supporting characters from every instalment featured here ‚Äì Matt Schulze's Vince from number one; Tyrese's big-mouthed Roman and Ludicrous' Tej from 2 Fast 2 Furious; Sung Kang's charismatic Han from Tokyo Drift; and Gal Gadot's sexy Gisele from F&F ‚Äì with a post-credits cameo to cap it off. Scribe Chris Morgan has obviously done his homework as, in addition to the 'who's who' line-up of co-stars, there are references to the previous movies (and characters that don't appear) and he introduces subplots that help build on earlier story lines. This integration of the Fast universe, along with the marvellously tongue-in-cheek mood, notches up a level of interest not before seen in the car-crazy franchise.After taking a new course with Tokyo Drift, and failing to impress with Fast & Furious, filmmaker Justin Lin has well and truly ignited the series with exciting set pieces and lashings of well placed humour. He still struggles to effectively call the shots when exposition (or mere conversation) is required; however he clearly has a handle on shooting the various fast-paced action scenes. There is a spectacular heist of luxury cars aboard a train (with a marvellously ridiculous denouement); a Bourne-esque free-running chase along roof tops; and a bruising hand-to-hand melee between The Rock and big Vin.Of the major stars, it's Fast newcomer Dwayne Johnson who shines the brightest. His epic bad-ass cop makes Toretto look like an absolute sissy, which is no easy feat. He also boasts many of the film's greatest lines and comes away looking the least corny ‚Äì something Diesel and Walker are evidently use to by now. The chalk and cheese pairing of the two wannabe action stars brings with it a decent slab of shonky acting. Chrome-domed Diesel is especially silly and unconvincing when required to open his mouth, but he looks good behind the wheel of a car and adds plenty to the unapologetic macho atmosphere.Thanks to Morgan's decent script, Lin's solid grasp on the action and Johnson's tough-as-nails turn, this latest addition to a franchise that appeared to be running on fumes has just stepped on the gas.3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Average, 3 - Good, 4 - Great, 5 - Brilliant)",Troy_Campbell,4/21/11,2011
10,6,The Day When Puerto Rico Has Become Rio de Janeiro,"The former agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and his girlfriend Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) rescue her brother Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) during the transportation to the prison and they flee to Rio de Janeiro. They rob a car from custody and find that the powerful drug lord Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) has a US$ 100,000.00 in a safe located inside the police station and protected by corrupt policeman. Dominic invites his skilled crew to steal the dirty money and achieve their freedom, moving to a country without extradition to the USA. Meanwhile the tough FBI agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) comes to Brazil with an elite force to arrest Dominic and Brian.""Fast Five"" is an entertaining action film, with cartoonish shootings and fights and an insane car race that destroys dozens of cars and locations. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Dwayne Johnson are synonym of great action scenes, and is nice to see the gorgeous Jordana Brewster that speaks a perfect Portuguese and Elsa Pataky.For Brazilian and specially ""cariocas"" (natives from Rio de Janeiro), this film is also a comedy with the stereotyped Rio and a great quantity of mistakes. Most of the scenes are shot in Puerto Rico; most of the accent of actors speaking Portuguese are not from Rio but from S√£o Paulo or from native in Spanish; Hernan Reyes is not a Brazilian name and Joaquim de Almeida is an actor from Portugal; there are ridiculous geographical mistakes, like for example, the references to the noble areas of Avenida Atl√¢ntica and Leblon. The sequences in the slums are also funny, since the modus operandi of armed drug dealers is totally different, using snipers from the top of the hills and barriers in the accesses to avoid the police and paramilitary forces. An American force would never have jurisdiction in Brazil. Last but not the least, there are many corrupt cops in Brazil, but never in such level. I do not understand why the production has not used Brazilian actors and actresses in supporting roles to giver credibility to the footages with the external landscapes of Rio de Janeiro. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Velozes & Furiosos 5 - Opera√ß√£o Rio"" (""Fast & Furious 5 ‚Äì Operation Rio"")",claudio_carvalho,9/17/11,2011
11,10,I wasn't expecting much from this...but WOW.,"I enjoyed the movie so much, that I came onto IMDb and registered myself just so that I can post a review. The movie was packed with jaw dropping, eye popping action from beginning to end. The drama had a mix of sadness, comedy and seriousness which were all mixed in together so beautifully to give a consistency to keep the viewer starring at the screen and being involved in the movie rather than daydreaming about other things. In my honest opinion I would say that it is the best Fast & Furious movie to date. I want to go see it again!(by the way, I realise that this isn't the best review in the world or might even be an awful review, the point is that I enjoyed the movie thoroughly and felt I should contribute to it's high average ratings).",mus_ne_17,4/23/11,2011
12,6,Not a hint of realism...,"Now, this movie had its strengths... and its weaknesses... First off, great acting. All actors were superb. Good action scenes, nice action shots and cinematography. The script was a bit shabby.. But I need to vent about my main issue with this title... It doesn't have any realism in the movie at all. None.

First example: A car drives in front of a bus, they were going fairly fast but it should not have had THIS outcome.. The bus hits the back of car. The bus is then propelled 20-30 feet into the air, lands, and is ripped to shreds. No fatalities either, and somehow they snuck an inmate out from the scene of the crime without a soul knowing about it. The bus flying through the air from a minor collision like that is what really angered me.

Second example: An all-terrain vehicle speeds along next to a train. Not only does it stay with the train for a good 10 minutes in the exact same spot without any trouble adjusting to the trains speed, but it is clamped on with enough stability that a team of 2 can use plasma cutters to cut a wall large enough to smuggle a car out of. I liked the idea, but it wasn't put together properly. To make things worse, after a few cars are smuggled out, a final car, with about 2 feet of room to gain momentum with, had enough speed to make an enormous leap off of the train and land perfectly with smooth sailing the rest of the way. This is followed by two men in the car flying off of a cliff large enough to kill anybody landing in the water below. In the real world, limbs would have been lost. They land like it was nothing.

Third example (this takes the cake): An armored vehicle plows through the walls of a police station.. I'm okay with this. Two Chargers pull up, chain themselves to this 10 ton vault, and have enough traction and friction to pull the entire vault off of the wall and out of the building. In a real world situation, the cars would make no progress and spin out, or the chains would break... and they take off! Speeding through Rio with a 10 ton vault, wrecking down buildings, smashing cars, dodging people, and smashing everything else in sight. This really irritated me. It even went through a large concrete building, the chain being strong enough to tear the building apart. I have no clue how this is even plausible. The vault then flies around smashing everything in its path again, still being pulled by these two wimpy cars. Eventually, the police catch up. The drivers suddenly have the dexterity to move the vault and fling it to their will. They smash some more cop cars, cause more collateral damage, and then decide they are going to split up. One Charger takes the vault on its own, and another takes off in the opposite direction. This solo driver suddenly has even more dexterity, and flings the vault around some more, taking out cop cars left and right, killing people exactly how he ""planned it"". Like I said earlier, if you are pulling a vault the size of a building around in a solitary car, the tires would not have enough traction to continue, and the car wouldn't have enough horsepower to drag that monstrosity around.

It goes on and on, I wish I could actually watch this movie without those three examples. It would be great. I loved the rest of it. But, save all this junk for a sci-fi movie... I can stand small amounts of movies being non-realistic, there are exceptions.. But not taking realism into consideration at all is a bit of a downer. Apparently physics don't apply to anybody living in Rio De Janeiro.",Cowzilla15,4/29/11,2011
13,2,Appalling,"There's a limit to how many sequels you can make to an action movie that was not very smart to begin with and still end up with something watchable. They change the scenery a bit, one-up the carnage and the special effects, add a little seasoning and shake well.The thing that made the Fast and the Furious really good was always the fast cars and the portrayal of the street racer subculture with some crime and action on the side. Unfortunately Fast Five fails to deliver the proved formula - the action is too prominent, and frankly feels ridiculous most of the time. The street racing and the tuner scene are moved to the side to make room for more gunfights and ridiculous action scenes. The plot is predictably weak and while the regular cast makes a good effort of keeping the whole thing afloat, their efforts are undermined by some of the new faces (anyone like wrestling?).The whole thing feels like a meaningless series of action scenes glued together with a few romantic moments meant to tend the female demographic. There is no sense of flow throughout the movie and I never felt part of the action, it was not even remotely believable. I wish I could say that the movie was not really bad, just mediocre but that would be lying. Spare yourself some disappointment and go watch something else.",explicit-1,5/8/11,2011
14,7,'FAST FIVE' gets 3.5 out of 5.,"'FAST FIVE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) I was never a big fan of the original 'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS' and thought it was severely over-hyped. With each sequel though I think the franchise has gotten better (although I never saw the third chapter: 'TOKYO DRIFT'). This one (for the first time) brings together key cast members from all of the other films including Vin Diesel (who sat out the second film and only did a cameo in the third), Paul Walker (who was absent from the third film), Jordana Brewster (who missed the second and third films) as well as Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang, Cal Gadot and Tego Calderon (who all co-starred in one or two of the other films). It also adds Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson to the cast and fans finally get to see a long anticipated fight scene between he and Vin Diesel. The film is directed by Justin Lin (who also directed the last two films) and written by Chris Morgan (who wrote the last two films as well). It all adds up to a pretty entertaining action film that should definitely please most fans of the genre as well as fans of the franchise.The film opens directly where the last one left off with former FBI agent turned outlaw Brian O'Conner (Walker) and girlfriend Mia (Brewster) breaking Mia's brother and Brian's buddy and partner in crime Dominic Toretto (Diesel) out of prison, by attacking the prison bus he's on. They then flee to Brazil and due to a botched car heist (where DEA agents are murdered) they're moved to the top of America's most wanted list. The baddest federal agent around, Lucas Hobbs (Johnson), is then put on assignment to track them down. O'Conner and Toretto then decide to pull one last big job on the crooked businessman, Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), who framed them by stealing $100 million of his laundered money. They bring in a team of former associates to help them pull off the heist.The movie is really predictable and the story and character development pretty routine but the action scenes are amazing. The film does drag a little in the middle, during the overlong heist setup part of the film but for the most part it's really fast paced and thrilling. The stunts are some of the best ever performed (probably) and the amount of sheer destruction in the film is astonishing. There are several scenes that seriously push the realm of logic and reality but it's all in good senseless fun. The Rock makes a cool addition to the series and the fight scene between him and Diesel doesn't disappoint. The film is most likely everything you think it's going to be and it delivers exactly what it promises. In that sense it's definitely a success and in my opinion at least a little better than all the others in the franchise (just adding the Rock makes it that much better).Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_pFXcDSfo",Hellmant,4/30/11,2011
16,8,Noisy entertainment even though it could have done with being tighter and more urgent than it was,"Very early in this film Paul Walker's character is hanging off the side of a speeding train in urgent need to get off before it hits the bridge. Instead of jumping to the ground and hoping he can roll his speed down, he jumps to a speeding car seconds before an explosion and then goes with that car as it flies off a cliff into a several hundred meter drop into a lake. At this point my girlfriend asked how any of that had been easier than just jumping onto the ground considering that hitting water from that height is similar to hitting concrete. I couldn't argue her logic but I did have to explain that her logic and attention to detail have no place in a film franchise that has hit its fifth instalment without ever suggestion that logic or plotting are anywhere near as important as a shot of a young woman's ass and a love of fast cars.And that is the problem with Fast Five that you need to overcome, it will at no point do much with the plot unless it knows it can get from that bit of plotting to the next car, gun or ass scene with minimal effort. It is a summer movie though and the ""Five"" in the title does mean that you should know what you're coming to with it. So I did my best to overlook the plot which is messy and a lacking logic at pretty much every turn ‚Äì I over look it because I'm happy to surrender logic if the film can give me thrills and action. Mostly the film does, or at least it gives spectacle. Whether it is the foot escape over favela roofs or the ridiculous destruction derby of the robbery itself, the film provides you with a lot to look at and as such it is entertaining as spectacle. Personally I though the whole film could have greatly benefited from being tighter outside of these scenes and needed an injection of actual danger and tension. Instead everything happens and our characters and their cars seem indestructible, which does rather detract from the action because the viewer doesn't really ""care"" or worry about what is going on ‚Äì it is all about just the spectacle. Although, like I said, it does do this well.Previous films in this series have had terrible effects and some awful CGI cars (that look CGI). I'm sure computer effects were in use here but mostly it doesn't show ‚Äì specifically the car chases and scenes of destruction are satisfyingly real; again they may be effects but they are very good if they are because you do have the satisfying feel of stunt men working hard in the real world ‚Äì something so many effects-driven blockbusters forget about now that computers can do so much. Matching the spectacle the cast mostly do what they are required to do by looking great. Paul Walker remains good-looking and has the sparkle in his eye that makes him fun to watch in these film. Alongside him Vin Diesel looks like he is half asleep in the most part and in this film his presence is massively damaged by having to be compared to The Rock. The Rock may not have much to do but he has great presence and a real brutal charm ‚Äì arms the size of tree-trunks also help his ""character"" but, like I said, it makes Diesel look dull and out-of-shape by comparison (although the dull one is certainly true). Outside of them Brewster is OK despite having little to do, Tyrese brings his mouth but not the homoerotic comedy that he brought to the second film while both Pataky and Gadot have tremendous figures. Ludicrous, Kang and others in the gang appear to be in for fans of the franchise but it gives too many characters to care about ‚Äì in terms of excitement and making the film tighter, it would have been better with a smaller group and tighter focus.Overall Fast Five is a fun film in a franchise that has seen some poor ones already. It provides spectacle and noise which is all one can ask for ‚Äì even if I would have loved it to be tighter, more dramatic.",bob the moo,9/21/11,2011
17,7,Entertainment: Ego Driven Car Races,"Ten years after the inception of the fast car action film phenomenon, Fast Five takes the U.S. box office by storm beginning summer early this year. Director Justin Lin (""Anapolis"") achieves an opening box office numbers north of 80 mil by amassing all of the franchise's most badass stars including Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Sung Kang, Matt Schulze along with adding the brute power of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. As expected, there is no plot or character development what so ever, immediately throwing the audience into the escape of Dominic ""Dom"" Toretto (Diesel) sentenced to twenty-five years in prison, facilitated by ex-cop Brian O'Connor (Walker) and Mia Toretto (Brewster). Following Dom's escape, Brian and Mia seek the help of an old friend, Vincent (Schulze), in Rio de Janeiro undertaking a job to steal three cars from a moving train as they wait for Dom's arrival. The heist goes amiss, however, they learn two things, first, they cannot trust anyone and second this is just the tip of the iceberg of the ticket to their freedom. Dom, Brian and Mia commence the biggest robbery the series has ever seen with a 100 million dollar target from the most corrupt and powerful man in Rio, Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). Needless to say, they call Roman Pearce (Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Han (Sung Kang) among other franchise favorites to evade the clutches of Reyes and U.S. federal agent Luke Hobbs (Johnson).Not many sequels stand up to their first installments, however, after four semi-entertaining sexy action thrillers struggling to create a worthwhile plot, ""Fast Five"" does more than equivocating its predecessors. The film's over the top ridiculous scope leaves very little room for slow boring moments. Instead it is full of pointless action scenes including a five-minute foreseeable faceoff between Diesel and Johnson. The battle of the brawny is accompanied by the battle of the sexy between Jordana Brewster and newcomer Elsa Patakay (local Rio cop Elema Neves). And yes there are ego driven car races.The same reasons that make ""Fast Five"" better than its predecessors make the film the true mess that it is. A completely flawed grandiose plot combined with ridiculously bad acting and Tyrese Gibson's clich√© one-liners and Johnson's childish clever phrases such as ""Now give me the veggies"" make the script seem like something a 13 year old thought up while playing Need For Speed with his friends. However, by disregarding plot development and clever writing, ""Fast Five"" has broken through the bonds that have always been holding the series back.In the end, nothing stands in the films way as the writers completely shirk their job letting the cast loose through a labyrinth of explosive fun. All that matters is that ""Fast Five"" is the epitome of a Hollywood moneymaker. It is entertainment.",jonnyhavey,5/3/11,2011
19,7,"Fast, fun and mindless fury ... once again","I went into this movie expecting the usual; fast cars and hot babes held together with a more than flimsy action-packed story line and Justin Lin seemed to schizophrenically deliver (or did he?). The movie starts with a famously stolen and instantly aggravating ""one last job"" scene, obviously not something any movie goer can believe in this instance because let's face it who finishes a movie series on its fifth? This movie sees the return of all the usual (and previous) F&F characters and same tricks of the trade we have seen Brian and Dom perfect with all the usual so-called tense last minute escapes Hollywood has rinsed dry, yet still this movie does deserve its 7/10 rating.How? Rio and the favelas are beautifully shot, the new characters are refreshing and VERY well casted, the vehicles are awesome, although lacking in their usual ""bling"" quality and the witty humour running through from previous F&F's is a little bonus for fans of the previous movies. Coupled with a sprinkling of nail biting moments and generous helpings of laugh-out-loud moments this testosterone injected movie is no doubt a fun, easy on the mind movie to go and watch.Unfortunately, like all ""fun and easy on the mind"" movies, the simplicity of it all becomes very predictable and the same is true for this movie. The story line, although containing a couple of very interesting screws, is essentially like any other heist movie we've all seen before (you already know the conclusion and you always wonder where they magically get all that military level kit from). The fight scenes have obvious outcomes, the alliances of certain characters are openly questionable and the character of Matt Schulze (Vince) is more pointless than jet skiing in your 15 meter, back garden swimming pool.The UNENDING swarms of mind-blowingly beautiful women and roaring hot cars are haplessly missing in the trial to create a more interesting storyline, which has only lead to needless additions into the story which add nothing to the overall plot. This movie is like a man in his late 20's desperate to become something more yet hold onto his youth and ending up messing up on both fronts. There's a token nitrous moment amidst the scores of needless carnage and overflowing testosterone levels from the tanking cast and developments in Brian and Mia's relationship add nothing to the story.Overall, the movie is enjoyable but lacks the zing of maybe the first two. It falls short of a modern day epic man-movie like the ""expendables"" and clearly lacks the strong storyline and acting prowess of a brilliant modern day heist movie like ""the bank job"". Saying that, it would still be a shame to miss this movie.",deathiscoming-1,4/30/11,2011
20,8,The Summer Begins Now!,"Well, color me surprised. The Fast and The Furious has not been a series known for it's intelligence. Indeed, it's always been big, loud, and dumb. The original hit the right notes at the time of its release, appealing to many as a street racing film where few films has treaded before it. However, it's lackluster sequels failed to deliver. With the adrenaline rush of the original over and poor writing and acting all around, the sequels were nothing more than a series of poor imitations that could never recapture the thrills of the first film. So, it's with some surprise that Fast Five is arguably the best film in the series.

Fast Five ditches the street racing that made it's name in favor for being a heist film. In this particular case, we pick up right from where we left off, with Dom being busted out of his prison bus. They then flee to Rio where they take on a heist that goes haywire and eventually leads to the penultimate heist of the film. In the meantime, ruthless Agent Hobbs, who specializes in tracking and capturing people, arrives to catch out trio of outlaws. The film does a good job of not wasting any time and most of the serious moments are kept to a minimum in favor of heist scenes or action. And in the action department, the film delivers tenfold. Far bigger, louder, and more exciting than any F&F film before it, action junkies should find themselves thrilled by the impressive set pieces and testosterone-laced mix of car and foot action.

Now, don't get me wrong, this is still a F&F film. This means that the script is still pretty laughable and the acting leaves much to be desired. However, with that said, it's still a bit improved here. Vin Diesel still can't play up emotion very well, making his attempts at the more serious scenes here a bit laughable. Paul Walker doesn't fair much better and, unfortunately, even as a main character takes a back seat to Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson. As action stars though, these three do a great job. In particular, the eventual confrontation between Diesel and Johnson is fantastic, with it being a brutal, WWE-esque rumble. The climactic scene alone is worth the price of admission. Though laughable, it's still an exciting, eye-popping scene that will leave you a little stupefied.

Certainly, you have to suspend much of your disbelief with your film. If you can't do that, you'll just find this entire film laughable and of poor entertainment value. For those who can though, this is a very entertaining film. And for fans, you'll certainly enjoy the film, with a well rounded cast from throughout the entire series coming together to pull off the impossible. It's definitely surprising to see that the fifth film in the series is the best, but I suppose that it's merely the evolution of F&F. With enough money, talent, and by pulling out all the stops, the franchise has finally capitalized on the over-the-top aspects that they had always seemed to go for. Suffice to say, action fans with enough suspension of disbelief will enjoy this immensely.",cadillac20,4/29/11,2011
21,7,Great fun!,"Fast Five - you'd think by the fifth instalment the Fast & Furious franchise would have run out of nos but this film really 'packs a punch'. Think of what you expect from this film, and then make it really amazing! Great chases - all kinds! -, great fist fights (Vin Diesel vs. The Rock..!!), great action sequences.... everything you would want from this film is IN IT and if you suspend all disbelief and go with it, its done brilliantly. Even the cheesy lines and plot twists become enjoyable.Not sure I'd pay a full adult weekend cinema price to see it, but if you can get 241 or a student discount, definitely see it on the big screen! Or wait for the blu-ray. Either way, you won't regret it when you see the beads of sweat running off The Rock's huge, bald head. Weird.",elby_monkey,4/5/11,2011
22,8,Fifth is good,"One normally expects the law of diminishing returns to set in with sequels. But Fast Five is fine.

Diesel, Walker & Co are in Rio looking for a big score, with Dwayne Johnson's crack team looking to bring them back to answer for various crimes (the fact that these guys have no jurisdiction in Rio is mentioned, but otherwise overlooked).

There are a couple of excellent set pieces bookending some entertaining character stuff and plot movement. And when I say ""excellent"", what I mean is not very probable, but immensely entertaining, with brilliant stunt work interlaced with visual effects so well that you can't tell which is which.

I thoroughly enjoyed this.",neil-476,4/21/11,2011
23,7,Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Fast Five,"The latest in the Fast and Furious franchise has recently hit the screens and what with the others being a good way to spend a few hours I was hoping for a similar type of movie from this one with plenty of great cars and car chases to boot.Set after Fast & Furious (No. 4) but before The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (No. 3), this time the action is played out in Rio, Brazil after Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) has escaped from police custody in the US with help from his old pal Brian (Paul Walker) and sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) and gone into hiding. With them needing money to disappear forever, Dom hatches a plan to steal all the money from Rio's most reputable underworld kingpin Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida).At the same time they are being hunted down by the elite federal agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and his team who are trying to capture and take him back to prison. Although it is quite possible to watch this movie without seeing the previous 4 there will be some parts that may slip you by as the writers have assumed that, if your coming to see this movie then there is a very strong possibility you have seen at least a couple of the prequels/sequel.One thing that I was quite surprised about was the lack of actual cars in the storyline. Sure they were involved slightly more than a normal action movie but I was expecting a lot more. There were probably only 2/3 scenes involving racing or car stunts and when the whole movie is supposed to be based around cars I was expecting just that little bit more. If fact in one scene just when you are expecting a good old fashioned drag race, they cut away to reveal the car back in the garage and already won! The action does make up for this though and is fast flowing throughout as they jump from one explosion/fight scene to the next. The casting of Johnson as the bad-ass agent was a stroke of genius with him bringing his former WWE smack talk to the character. He really makes you want to hate him and I especially enjoyed the Johnson Vs. Diesel fight scene as the 2 heavyweights traded blows.At over 2 hours this is by far the longest in the franchise and although in general the time will pass quickly, they could have easily chopped off a few minutes here and there to stop the risk of it dragging for some people. The acting and script is nothing special and you will have to sit through a fair bit of 'we're doing this for family' talk but that is not what people will come to watch this movie for.With Neal H. Moritz announcing in March the development of a sixth and seventh movie for the series it is doubtful that this surprisingly long lasting franchise will go away quietly. Despite having lots of good action and successfully filling a void in my day, lets just hope that they return to the core basics for the next one rather than forgetting the main reason for these movies was supposed to be the cars.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",iReviewFilms,4/29/11,2011
24,3,"Poorly made-up fiction, mocky action.","This one was too much even for the F&F franchise; I would call McGuiver and Jammy Bond, maybe even Braddock. And many places didn't look like Brazil, which has almost no passenger railways at all (maybe there're three or four, no more than 200 miles I guess), what to say TGV (or something looking like it, I really can't figure what was that). Second, it was more like Mexico, if I know something about that. Finally, I don't know where they found so many import cars for those do exist in very, very limited quantity. And just a dozen (in the entire country) are designated as patrol units, for use of senior officers who aren't seen around driving them. Well, there's no fun in driving a VW Fox or a Fiat with 79HPs, uh?",dueda,5/10/11,2011
25,8,"Clich√©, stupid stunt, clich√©, bad joke, clich√©, bad acting...","Why does this movie have a 7.4 rating??? Have people lost their taste in movies? I don't understand it. I don't even know where to start. This movie had every single clich√© possible plus the jokes were insulting to one's intelligence. The acting was just bad. The stunts were ridiculous. Nothing made sense (this should be a science fiction movie, since none of those stunts could ever happen given simple laws of physics). Yeah, the stunts also insulted my intelligence. I was left speechless...and for 2 hours. The car chases were plain boring. The shooting and fighting scenes where the good guys kill 100 bad guys, and the good guys don't even get a scratch from being shot at with automatic machine guns, were a big yawn. And there was a looong fight scene where people get thrown through glass and walls and they break each other's faces and then when they are shown 1 second later they don't have one scratch!!! That's representative of how much effort was put into this movie!",rammvier,10/7/11,2011
26,7,Fast Five gives a movie-going experience that alternates between adrenaline-pumping high and dull lows.,"The fifth installment of the popular Fast and Furious series (2001, 2003, 2006, 2009), Fast Five is, as fanboys have claimed, the best of the franchise thus far. I admit I have not seen the prequels prior to this, and even so, I doubt I would be even motivated to consider reviewing them, thus I cannot and will be unlikely to check the legitimacy of those claims. That means this review is purely based on my observations of this film per se, and without any prior knowledge about this franchise nor its characters other than its long-running theme of fast cars, crime, and hot women.

Fast Five stars two muscle men in Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson, who in one inevitable and obligatory scene are pitted against each other in an unarmed muscle fight to seewell, who has more muscles. It also stars franchise veteran Paul Walker, and a huge supporting cast of mostly relative unknowns. This gang of characters pulls out a daring heist of a vault containing a hundred million dollars belonging to a corporate- disguised drug lord with ties to the mob and the police. Diesel, who plays Dominic, leads his team in the heist, while Johnson, who plays federal agent Hobbs, chases after them.

Directed by Justin Lin, who helmed the third and fourth installments of the series, Fast Five scores highly in its execution of action. Lin shows that he is well-adept at directing car crashes, gunfights, and ka- booms, with the film providing fans with a near orgasmic brand of pedal- flooring excitement. The action scenes are surprisingly clear to see and easy to follow. In fact, they are so well-edited that not only do they generate suspense, but also present a kind of orchestrated sleekness not frequently seen in action movies these days.

Some, including myself, would feel that the action is extremely unrealistic in the way it defies the laws of physics. The most obvious example is the entire climactic sequence involving two cars hauling a huge metal vault along the streets at full speed creating havoc that inconceivably does not seem to hurt anyone collaterally. However, it is in the nature of this franchise that action is required (or rather, demanded) to be unrealistic. Lin emphasizes this in the prologue sequence in which a police bus containing prisoners somersaults acrobatically after colliding with a car to the cheers of fans in the theater.

Fast Five's story is slightly thicker than a wafer, and is serviceable only to the extent of progressing the plot. Some characters may seem surplus to requirements but they do provide the occasional off-color humorous remark on their present circumstance. In addition to the weak narrative and undeveloped characters, the entire film is not very well- paced, despite the excellent editing of action. Much of the film drags along during times of planning of the heist and the test-driving of real sporty cars. A number of expository scenes could be trimmed to create more urgency; in fact, I feel that this film is a good twenty minutes too long.

Fast Five gives a movie-going experience that alternates between adrenaline-pumping high and dull lows. If your diet consists of brainless entertainment, this is your key to salvation. If you are an action fan, this would also be your territory. For those whom are just plain curious like me, I say try it out and judge for yourself.

27,10,Best F'n'F yet,"After varying degrees of success with the franchise, My faith that ""Fast 5"" could deliver on the hype was waning somewhat. However I am pleased to say the series has redeemed itself. Fast 5 pulls out all the stops this time around. It delivers on action, cars, quality acting and a decent storyline. It explores the character personalities showing more humor, fear, vulnerability and determination this time around which gives the movie strength and depth that was missing from previous Fast n Furious movies. I found myself laughing out loud a few times at the subtle humor, and leaning forward for the action scenes which are truly amazing.The Story is not predictable and will keep the surprises coming to the end. The Cast has matured and it shows in the quality of acting over previous F'n'F movies.Pros:Good pace throughout the movieDecent storyline and plotGood Cast of actors/ actressesImaginative and inventive elements throughoutPlenty of ""Wow"" momentsCons: Would be nice to have more screen time for the carsa couple of cheesy moments ( but this adds to the humor of the film)Overall: Highly recommended film, Just be sure to stay until the end of the credits!9.5/10",corey_dw,4/19/11,2011
28,7,"Not a Five Star title, but definitely Fast","The producers / distributors / makers (call them what you may) behind this movie have decided to transition The Fast And The Furious Series of movies from a street racing franchise into an action / heist one with car chases at its helm instead of the notorious street races that governed most of the previous movies. Had I not watched any of the past movies, I would have certainly welcomed this move. But after seeing all four of them (in anticipation of this one), I believe that leaving out street racing from this movie was not a pretty good idea - there's just one race in this movie and that too, is a friendly sort of no stakes race. Although I can understand the studio's motives behind doing so, The Fast And The Furious series of films deserve at the least one race per film.Anyways, enough of the complaining already. Coming to the point, which is Fast Five, the movie is surely fast and equally furious. The fourth movie ended with Paul and Mia attempting to bust out Dom from prison with an animated escape shown in the end. The fifth movie begins just at that point with a live action escape sequence replacing the animated one at the end of the previous installment. After a job that goes awry, the trio are then on the run since they're wanted by two factions of people - the crew of a businessman Reyes and the team of a DSS agent Luke Hobbs. After running around for some time, they decide to pull one last job to buy out their freedom with fake passports and start life afresh. But with these two powerful men on their tails, it ain't gonna be that easy.Fast Five is more of an action movie and so, for it to work, there has to be action. And there is - plenty of it. Without spoiling most of it by describing it in detail, I'd say the high points of the movie are the train job at the start that goes awry and sets up the events of the movie, the trio's escape from both teams who get to them simultaneously over rooftops, a fight between Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and of course, the finale which is absolute madness. And perhaps all of the sequences have been shot without any use of CGI which is what makes the action even all the more exciting and brings back memories of the past era of action movies where all sequences were filmed rather than digitally created.The cinematography is top notch as well. Although there are a lot of cuts in action sequences, we still get some long continuous areal views of the action (long meaning lasting around 5 seconds or so) which helps understanding what's going on and where it all fits into the surroundings. This ensures you're with the action. Performances are decent and for a mostly wooden Paul Walker reprising his role as Brian O'Connor, you have a surprisingly flexible Dwayne Johnson playing Luke Hobbs - the new entry in the franchise. His character is exactly what he told it would be in the behind the scenes featurettes - strong, efficient at nabbing criminals and a worthy antagonist to Dominic Toretto and his team mates. I'd definitely want him to return in the next installment. And although this ain't a movie about characters, we get some dialogs which actually help us understand the characters a little better giving us some insight into their lives. Nothing deeply psychological - just a tinge of what's hidden beneath the surface. Nice.On the whole, Fast Five is solid entertainment provided you're willing to suspend your disbelief and forget the laws of physics. But then, we always do suspend our disbelief to some extent in movies - that's what they're for. And none of us really does remember the laws of physics so they're irrelevant for the most part. In which case, the movie comes highly recommended and even more so for an action movie buff. This is the definitive action movie of the year. And do stay for some time for a nice post credits surprise which unlike many meaningless sequences, is a critical post-credits scene that might set up the next installment in the series.Score: 7.0 / 10",KrazzyDJ,5/8/11,2011
29,8,Adrenaline pumping hardcore popcorn action done right,"The weather is finally better, people are taking their clothes off all over the place and even though it is still spring time, summer movies are now officially kicking off and ladies and gentleman, we start this summer right with Fast Five. The Fast and Furious franchise is something of an acquired taste, a sort of guilty pleasure that hasn't really been shown the respect it has earned. It isn't known for any of the terms critics love to use when they complain about a movie, like intellectual dialogue, solid characterization or even anything remotely close to a thought provoking plot. No, what it excels in is another term that critics seem to have forgotten about. Popcorn, no that overpriced buttery stuff you get from a concession stand, I'm talking popcorn films! Energetic movies meant to entertain, a good solid waste of time! So what makes a good popcorn film? Well if this question is asked to the future filmmakers of tomorrow one need only to watch Fast Five to see a fine example of how to get it right. Director Justin Lin (who also directed the fast and the furious) makes a huge leap in directorial prowess by showing an incredible eye for action that every other director today should take note at. The man can film ACTION, and you know..In an action movie¬Öthat's kind of what you want and with that eye brings together an expendables version of the fast and furious franchise starring everyone's favorite fast and furious stars. Dominic Toretto (played by Vin Diesel) and his crew find themselves on the wrong side of the law once again as they try to deal with a drug lord and a federal agent that's hot on their trail. So , um¬Öback to talking about the action. It is INNNNcredible. Oh man this is my kind of action, I seriously have not seen this kind of solid , non computer generated action in a very very long time and Justin Lins camera work is top notch. Every shot is deliberate and clean. Oh¬Öso good. Aside from the action the other thing that makes this film work is the stars. Everyone from The Rock to Ludicrous play their characters great and have their own moments to shine. While the movie does slow down in the middle to what looks like Ocean's Eleven meets Fast and Furious, the stars are what keep this movie was falling apart. The movie at times felt like a parody of action films, filled with cheesy clich√©'s that are sometimes so subtle you'll miss it but Linn will toss another scene in there in case you did and often in hilarious ways . The rock is just so great, it's these roles he should be taking, not the flying fairy kind, he's so great in this film I would love to see a spin off with this very character of his, this cocky nonsense guy who just knows everything, and he really does know everything. Frankly, that's the only two things that this movie has going for it. Action and pretty people and in a popcorn film, that's all you need. So this one is easy folks, for those with their noses in the air looking for only citizen Kane caliber films to entertain them, you should know better, you know a fast and furious movie isn't for you. It's a vapid film that would have been unwatchable had it not been for its action and star power. But it pulls off being entertaining. So if you're looking for adrenaline pumping action , seat rumbling roars of the hottest cars , beautiful people looking beautiful even when being shot at then you got yourself the definition of a popcorn film, meant to entertain you in every single way and this is popcorn done right.",FuryoftheFilmFan,4/30/11,2011
31,9,The fastest and most furious ride yet.,"Making a sequel to a film is never normally a good thing. They excite all the fans of the previous film(s) and then disappoint them with a production that is not better than the original. The same goes for a remake. Some films turn into a series where each film becomes worse  this has been the case with the Fast and Furious series. However this fifth film is one that outclasses its predecessors, read on to see why. Fast Five continues where Fast and Furious left off, with Dominic sentenced to 25 years in jail and the bus chase that was seen at the end involving Mia and Brian. The aftermath of their interception was that they managed to break Dom out of custody, dodged every authority, and have fled to Rio de Janeiro (where every Brazilian seems to be portrayed as a gun-toting thug). In order to break free, they attempt to pull off a 100 million dollar heist. It isn't long before they all become a few of the most wanted criminals. Their mission that rips through Brazil sees two on their tail  federal agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), who never lets anyone escape and corrupt drug lord Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) who wants them dead. That's not really a witty plot. And there aren't great performances guided by a witty script either so rule out suspenseful conversations and memorable dialogue. A merit goes to the Dwayne Johnson though  he was perfectly cast for his role and shows a lot more of his talky WWE side unlike his last film Faster where he was virtually on mute. But Fast and Furious has never been known for excelling in those aspects of filmmaking. It's known for the action scenes. And what spectacular action scenes there are in Fast Five. It takes it turn to be more of The Expendables instead of the previous films of the series by having a 'men on a mission' plot element and emphasising more on fighting than racing. There's more road rage in here than street racing, and for the record there's even an ex-wrestler versus action hero fight like there was when Stone Cold fist fought Sly Stallone. The first act of the film is fast and furious. It quickly takes the audience on a relentless train ride where we see a train robbery in process. This act quickly builds up a background for the story so the audience knows who, what, when, how and why the team are in Brazil. The second act revolves around the main plot element of the $100 million heist. The film decelerates slightly here when we see the crew plotting. Anyone who would have seen the details of the film beforehand would realise why  this lasts over 2 hours, longer than all of the previous films. The 10 minutes after a full two hours weren't really necessary but show us the aftermath of the third act, the hugely thrilling act. Any who feel frustrated at the pace of the second act  stay for the climactic scene in the third act. Think of Fast Five as the cinematic equivalent of a mindless muscular athlete. Can't talk a good game but can surely play a good game. We have all met that person, that guy who failed his exams but took the football pitch by storm at high school. Fast Five is as absent minded  plain characters and clunky dialogue. But the 'physical' side is where it amazes  the action scenes of course. It's like the men behind the camera decided to perfect the action scenes, the plot was secondary. Looking at this year's earlier films The Mechanic and The Green Hornet, it's safe to say that Fast Five has the best action sequences of the year yet, and is the best action film overall so far. Verdict: Forgive the simplicity of the script and get ready for the fastest and most furious ride yet.",musanna-ahmed,4/21/11,2011
33,9,A Nutshell Review: Fast Five,"As far as franchise films go, The Fast and Furious series seem to be hitting the ground at top gear, with this installment not showing signs of slowing down, but prepping a new direction for future films to take, shifting gears from a film showcasing hot bodies (not solely just car chassis) and fast nox-enabled cars into the classic heist genre, given that it had that as its underlying premise from the first film, and now with a growing ensemble, are ready to give Ocean's Eleven a run for its money.Rio De Janeiro provides the backdrop in which this installment takes place in (quite a popular location for films recently too), with the chief villain being Reyes (Joaquim de Almedia), a mobster with a businessman front, with his tentacles of vice and influence extending toward every part of the city. Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and the former's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) hide out in the city as fugitives having broken Dom en route to prison at the end of Fast and Furious, and with the kind of money available for the taking to start a family of their own with Mia found to be pregnant, they decide to assemble a team, not to pass up the opportunity of robbing Reyes blind.So in comes a whole host of characters whom we have seen in past films, such as Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Gisele (Gal Gadot), and even Han (Sung Kang) whom we know what happened to in Tokyo Drift, hence putting the chronology of the films at 1, 2, 4, 5 and 3, which is now sometime in the not so immediate future. Director Justin Lin takes on his 3rd film of the franchise and together with writer Chris Morgan have managed to introduce new elements to surprise audiences and fans up until this installment, keeping with the usual action laden elements, while bringing on new characters into the franchise, this time with Dwayne Johnson coming in as a no nonsense, dogged and persistent FBI operative Hobbs, with an arsenal of technology and attitude to aid him and his team in tracking down Dom and his crew.And of course who cannot wait to see two tough guys in Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson go one on one with each other in a fisticuffs, especially since their time with family friendly films have taken a backseat to put them both firmly back into the action genre. It sets up new rivalry, while keeping the old between Dominic and Brian with the latter always keen to prove who's the better driver. And like most ensemble films, it's make or break given the character's appeal, and I'm glad to note they share this incredibly chemistry this bunch of highly skilled cons who each bring their know-how to the table in trying to pull off mission frickin' insanity, and everyone possessing a mean driver's license to power souped up vehicles.And if it's action you're seeking, it's action you'll get in this film too, putting aside the rather rote and superficial theme of family and trust. There's no lack of races and wheels on the roads although I do note that there's not too much of signature cars to go around this time. Even a would be street race was unceremoniously cut off, although we do get it compensated with a four way race down two traffic lights amongst Roman, Dom, Brian and Han which was more of a fair competition since they were all essentially driving the same model. Then there's the big bang finale that you would have seen in the trailer, with Dom and Brian yanking a bank vault and travelling down the streets of Rio at top speed, in what would be a fittingly noisy last act destroying everything, and I mean everything, along their path, that has to be seen in a cinema to enjoy this guilt trip in sense surround glory. Needless to say I am a fan of the franchise, and am excited about the direction this film would be going even if it would mean limiting the number of cars on the roads, since the film had already shown the potential of that chemistry between the cast and characters, and I'm eagerly anticipating more. From one fanboy and an action junkie to any other, this of course would be recommended fare. Stay tuned while the end credits roll, and you'll be treated to a stinger that reaffirms and teases what's to come in the next film, with no less than two surprise appearances. But no, with the timeline, it'll take a while before Lucas Black will be able to link up with the guys. For an adrenalin pumping high octane entertaining film outing, Fast Five is that opener to a very noisy and crowded summer season to come.",DICK STEEL,5/2/11,2011
38,10,The BEST of the franchise!,"I've been a personal fan of the F&F series ever since the very first title was released. Once I saw that Fast Five was in production I immediately began hunting down a pass for its first showing, I was successful. Fast Five is everything we all love about the franchise, fast cars, beautiful women, and of course some nail biting action scenes.Whether you're a long time fan of the movies, or a brand new viewer, this movie is a must see, you're guaranteed to get your moneys worth on this title.Best movie I have seen in a long time, it even managed to remove the bad taste that was left in my mouth by Tokyo Drift. This is going to be one of the biggest movies of the year, see it, or be left behind.Rating- 10/10 -Average Joe",AverageJoesReview,4/8/11,2011
41,7,Typical Fast and the Furious,"Fast Five is the fifth installment in the Fast and the Furious franchise, the second since the series was reclaimed by Vin Diesel and the gang. Since it is the fifth, there are no real surprises as to what the basis of the story is. They still are expert drivers that drives fast and real expensive cars. This time they end up in Brazil, fugitives from their break out at the end of the last movie.

A heist goes awry, and they end up becoming enemies to the top crime lord in Rio. At the same time the U.S. sends its best agent to apprehend them all. Suddenly Toretto and his friends must wage a battle at two fronts.

It is a good action, with some good stunts and effects, and some spectacular driving. Exactly what I have come to expect from a Fast and the Furious movie. Diesel is good as Toretto, and his match up with Dwayne Johnson is good. It is also good to see the characters from all the different movies get together.

In all, it is an entertaining movie, but it lacks the element of surprise, or the edge to give something really extra. It delivers what I expected, but not much of anything else. Still, it was good enough that I will most probably watch the next one.",Enchorde,9/26/11,2011
44,9,Best from its franchise,"Yesterday night, watching Fast Five at the cinema, I was surprised to see a standing ovation at the end of the movie as well as loads of clapping during the movie for a series of scenes - this is the first movie that I've witnessed such thing.People that paid for the ticket had high expectations and it was worth it. There was a bit for everyone: good comedy, nice cars, very dynamic and full of action, thrill and last but not least very good acting from Vin, Dwayne and the others.All in all it was well worth the money, it was obviously the best from its franchise and I am really looking forward to the F&F 6.",marius-jugariu,4/23/11,2011
50,7,Fast and Furious as Ever!,"The Fast and Furious Franchise always gave a fun time that's full of Rush, From the Very First movie to this, it's always fun to watch and you will always have fun if your a classic fan of the franchise, Now those who criticize this movie cant deliver Everything you want, i mean yes it's definitely not The Godfather! and you certainly wont expect anything of that magnitude in this movie, but than again this movie is all about having a good time and checking out fast car's and hot babe's. That's how it's always been and always will be, People Will be satisfied with this movie because it delivers what you expect and more. The Classic chase and thrill's and to add up the excitement there are some extra materials that i won't give away, so if you are fan of rush and excitement and just wanna have a good time , this is the movie for you.",Abir-Xtreme,5/4/11,2011
51,8,Bring on number 6 !,"When it comes to films, I think of myself as a guy of simple tastes and ""Fast and Furious"" always seems to satisfy me, it's got everything I could possibly hope to see. Attractive females - yes. Fast Cars - yes. Cool fights - yes and also as many bad ass explosions as you could possibly wish for. Don't get me wrong, the story is kinda important too.

So did ""Fast Five"" have what I was looking for ? In a word: Yes.

So I heard about this film last summer if I remember correctly and has two thoughts - my first was ""Ugh, Another ?"" and my second was ""Yes, another. Nothing wrong with that"" - so as time went on I gradually got more and more excited to see this film.

But enough about me, lets get on to the film.

The story was good and picks up from the 4th one when Dom is busted out of prison and the crew make their way down to Rio ... and to the top of the most wanted list and this provides an exciting start which is continued throughout.

The casting of Dwayne Johnson was one of my favourite parts about this film since I used to be a big wrestling fan and I thought he played his character brilliantly. As for the rest of the cast, they all had great performances and showed that they can really act.

Also included in the film, hidden away - behind about 45 seconds of credits, so don't leave early - is an extra scene with DJ and I believe Eva Mendes as well revealing a twist in the last film and perfectly setting up number 6.

So this film is definitely recommended, but do not go to the cinema expecting something on a par with The godfather or Schindler's list. Just sit back and enjoy the ride, cuz its as good as ""Fast and Furious"" is gonna get.",SamL132,4/22/11,2011
52,7,Fun Film For Fans of Fast & Furious Franchise,"Film series as of recent have been holding a better streak of adequate consistency than we might be accustomed to. Saw didn't start becoming rotten until the fourth installment and while the upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean film might not leave much of a strong impression, early reviews are indicating it'll likely be about as good as Dead Man's Chest (decent). Now we have the Fast and Furious franchise coming back with a fifth installment (and a sixth already in-development). Though the shameful 2 Fast 2 Furious might have been a poor addition, the remaining films have maintained an adequate level of execution and entertainment (peaking with the under-appreciated Tokyo Drift). And with Fast Five being the first of many guaranteed action blockbuster films for the summer, eyes have still been on it to deliver.What has to be made clear is that anyone who honestly wants to enjoy the film should leave their logic and standards at the concession stand. Because from the opening minute alone we're given a scene that defies all plausibility, and the things only continue down a similar road throughout. Now that this has been made clear, the skeptical shouldn't worry too much, for there's still a solid film to find here. Part of what helps Fast Five work as well as it does is thanks to the fact it embraces such an over-the-top nature that audiences are likely more willing to accept given the hardships of today's economy. If you've come to enjoy the crazy action characteristic of series such as Rambo and Die Hard, then you'll feel right at home here.Those who've followed the Fast and Furious films up to this point will probably get a fair amount of nostalgia throughout the film with various characters coming back, including a couple surprises not shown in trailers (one of whom audiences will want to stick around after the short credits, along with another curious surprise). As a result, long-time fans will get the most out of Fast Five. But this isn't to say that newcomers won't feel some sort of attachment (if not entirely to the characters). Since the return of various characters isn't relied on too heavily with regards to exposure, less-familiar viewers needn't worry about feeling lost or not getting an idea of what they're like throughout the runtime. Fast Five might not significantly raise the standards that we've come to expect from such a franchise, but it doesn't have to. With so many areas visited by previous installments, resorting to a more action/thriller-centered approach than even the previous film only seems like an inevitable and fitting road to travel. And you know what? The results are quite welcome and pleasing.P.S. Don't mind my alliteration-heavy summary.",Hellrazr360,5/14/11,2011
53,10,The Fast & The Furious 5 ( Fast Fi5e ),"I've just got back from the showing of this Movie, and with high expectations I must say I was not disappointed! The Promotional work for the movie has been strong and with me personally being a big fan of the Fast & Furious Movies ( owning all dvds ) I Couldn't wait to see it! The cast are back... some old faces from the previous films return ( with some surprises in store too :) ) The Script is spot on and the banter with the characters keeps everyone laughing! The action is fast paced & I felt had a Jason Bourne Theme to it ( Opinions!? ) The amount of Cars in the movie was pretty high but it did stray from the Car Racing Scene but in my opinion it didn't let the film down... The Plot of the Movie was just-worthy & the characters had more depth to them, which was definitely lacking in the previous films!!AT over two hours long... this movie is definitely the best of the Franchise & is a must see for all fans but also for people who aren't so keen on the other movies because this one is a winner all round & with a planned sequel in the mix...

54,7,Fast Five (or Ocean's Eleven with Dodge Chargers),"By the time a franchise gets to its fifth film you're probably worried that the laws of entropy are in full effect, and for good reason. Outside of horror franchises, how many fifth films can you name that were anywhere close to as successful or entertaining as the original? Maybe it had to do with having low expectations (after all I've suffered through 2 Fast 2 Furious and have wiped all memory of The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift from my conscious mind) but Fast Five seriously struck me as a fun to watch, exciting and funny action flick.

The basic premise is nothing new for a crime movie – bring in a team of the best in your field to split a multi-million dollar score that will allow for a cushy retirement from a life a crime. In this case, that score is to be had against the most powerful man in Rio de Janeiro.

To accomplish the job, lifetime criminal Dominic Toretto and former federal agent Brian O'Conner bring in a team of all the best racers and specialists that they have met along the course of their illustrious careers. Characters like Vince, Gisele, Han, Roman, Tej and other favorites come out of the woodwork for the big score.

Making that score becomes even more difficult when the United States government becomes involved and sends a ringer in to catch Dom and O'Conner. Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) is a match for Dom in almost every way. He's big, determined, and has the resources of the U.S. Department of State, Diplomatic Security Service at his disposal. Hobbs commissions the aid of a rookie Rio cop named ElenaWith her help, Hobbs makes life for the Ocean's Eleven-esque crew even more difficult. A ray of hope for Dom and the others lies in Elena, the widow of a clean cop offed by Reyes before the start of the movie. Elena will come up against a choice of doing her job without question or taking a shot at helping the criminal crew make a score against Reyes.

Aside from a fairly easy to follow plot this film has what you would expect, a solid soundtrack, good looking people in skimpy clothing, humor (though mostly as shallow as the human emotions portrayed) and, of course a barrage of fast cars in adrenaline charged chase and race scenes.

If you've stuck with the F&F franchise, odds are you are wondering what sort of cars you can expect from the most recent installment. I doubt you'll be disappointed. Let's take a look at a few of the cars you'll see.

Of course, Dom's immortal 1970 Dodge Charger is back, though in this setting it's forced to look a little less mean and impressive in order to stay under the radar. It's not the only Charger in the film – not by a long shot. Fast Five is filled with 2010 and 2011 Chargers (some realized as police vehicles and others are modified Chargers driven by Dom and O'Conner for the final heist). To round out the Dodge product placement was a 2010 Challenger.

Many of the modern cars in the film were used by the team to try and beat a camera array in a parking garage and driven only on an indoor test track. It gave filmmakers a good excuse to run some modern, hairpin turn capable cars like a Porsche GT3, 2010 Subaru STi, Nissan 370z, and others across the screen. Additional modern cars include a Lexus LFA, 1996 Toyota Supra, and a Koenigsegg CCX.

Classic car buffs have more to look forward to then Dom's Charger (a nice surprise after the NOS engine, rice-rocket sounding cars that have come to symbolize the franchise). Though the screen-time is brief, we see some work done with a '66 GT40, '66 Corvette Grand Sport, and quite a few other 60s and 70s muscle cars. Motorcycles weren't left out either as a real hot Ducati Street Racer (with a real hot Gal Godot on the throttle) makes an appearance.

If your taste in cars is at all similar to my own, you might find yourself drooling over Hobbs' government issued SUV that looks like a gorgeous, khaki-colored, utilitarian, armored behemoth on wheels and monster-truck shock absorbers. To save you some research, this beast is called a Gurkha LAPV. It's built on a Ford F550 chassis and was developed to withstand IED attacks with optional NATO level 3 armor. Though the top speed is about 90MPH, this beast is the perfect vehicle for the tight streets and uneven terrain encountered by Hobbs in his pursuit of Dom through Rio and surrounding areas in Brazil. And sorry, this vehicle is not available to civilians. Other than the cars there are a few more good reasons to head to the theater for this film. Adding Dwayne Johnson to the cast finally gives Vin Diesel someone imposing to match up with physically. Johnson's character Hobbs is a tough guy who lives like there is a strict line between black and white. While some of the characters in the film only have time to come off as two dimensional, Hobbs has three dimensions and is forced to make some choices that put his multiple motivations up against each other. Don't expect any Oscar worthy acting from Johnson or any of the other folks involved and don't expect some sort of gritty Eastwood realism and you should have a good time. As I mentioned, the plot of the film isn't real twisted, unique, or surprising, but it's fully realized and satisfying by the time we reach the conclusion.",swmayer,5/1/11,2011
56,7,A lot of testosterone and hot babes means good movie?,"The above sentence just sums it all, ""A lot of testosterone and hot babes."" For some, that's all it takes for a great movie. This movie was really just about Vin Diesel vs Rock, that's all. Without those 2 guys, this movie would've just sucked. In my opinion, this was NOT the BEST of fast and furious, the best is still Tokyo drift.Though most of the population just needs some violence and action to call it a good movie. Whether you want to admit or not, the fighting scenes were fake. Watching the movie, at the end, what lesson did you learn? Big guys with guns kick ass? Yay, when I grow up, I want to ride fast cars, steal money, and have a gang family and I'll still be the good guy. That's not how the real world works.Sure, they tried to add some elements from Ocean's 11 series with the Heist and everything, but that was most likely the only good part.",aiyush87,7/13/11,2011
57,1,Stop making these! Please,"OK, You know when you're in trouble when the die hard F&F fans behind you burst into hysterical laughter at the movie's very first stunt, but then again,so did the whole cinema.

This film is the classic metaphor for the postmodern tripe that Hollywood has had the misfortune of ever getting into bed with since Get Rich or Die Trying.....you'd think they would have taken a lesson.

It also is the classic overly used unrealistic stunts, like the ones we would usually see in the 80's muscle films. Classic example, 5mins into the film, Vin Disiel drives a car off a train, but hits the ground square on the nose and you see the wheel buckling.......you blink and the car is back to pristine condition......? And it was boring, yes extremely boring, for a driving film, they're was about 15mins max, the rest seemed to concentrate on developing love interests and avoiding the occasional rabid mob.

In this case - get cars, get paid and get lost................(that's pretty much how grammatically fluid the script was).

Plot - Once AGAIN ex FBI agent and Vin Disiel go about looking for top of the range cars as they're still broke and off the Radar, only this time in Brazil, one last job etc etc etc. FBI sends they're best man, who happens to be a pro wrestler ( but out acts all in the film by a long shot) and his muscle bound team of trigger happy feds. But there's a Rio business man/gangster with all this cash just hanging about in safe houses (how convenient), which they proceed to rob. Yawn! There are many faults with this film, but my top 5 gripes are thus: 1. The script & dialogue. Seems to be written by a middle school kid who is flunking at English. 'You Family' 'We Hungry' ' did yo slap or tap that ...........eh? Excuse me? Scripts....and Films like this (using the term loosely) justify film piracy. If refunds where available, who honestly wouldn't demand one after this garbage.

We get all the usual propaganda about how it funds terrorism and the other political mantras. This Film justifies the murder of cops, stealing cars and excruciatingly bad acting. Please can we have a law in the future which states that actors have to be part of the actors gild or trained to an acceptable standard ( by acceptable, not hitting out with this urban degeneration of English).

2. The cops just switch sides.......yes the cops that have no other goal but to hunt down and bring these men to justice, just change sides and help the bad guys out...............seriously, now get lost. And more to the point, why does the female cop instantly fall head over heels for someone who is in the same circuit that killed her husband, I found it was cringe worthy as the two of them swaggered up to the beach house at the end.

3. The 'we need a team to pull off this last job' Cant we make films about someones first job instead, its exemplifies the person who is sick of their day job, in this case, nicking cars and getting paid loads of cash.....but you can see the hypocrisy there. The team..........totally being ripped from Oceans 11 and Gone in 60 seconds films. The fringe characters from the previous F&F films, (I never did watch Toyko Drift so I didn't have a clue as to who the Japanese guy was. I can feel my blood pressure rising as I type.

4. They manage to rob a police station with more troops on the ground than America has in Afghanistan and Iraq and not take one single causality. Dragging a 10 tonne high security safe along with two medium range size cars??????? Who the hell where the two Brazilian freaks who did...... well, what exactly? Jumped around spewing out jokes with would only appeal to someone with the IQ of a demented Badger. The indoor training to beat the cameras where they needed invisible cars. So the highest security office in Brazil doesn't realise that 4 of its muscle cars, ( yes that's right the Brazilian police instead of Fords have supped up NOS guzzling super cars as basic patrol vehicles) are missing? And then it transpires that they don't need them. But just to keep a low profile, they drag race them along Rio main intersection.......Yeah sure, trying to be inconspicuous.

5. The big happy ending for everyone,......... laughable. Once again the cinema was in hysterics, not at the badly time jokes from Tyrese ' His agent should be shot for war crimes for introducing him to Hollywood' Gibson and his obvious comic relief character as, quite Frankly, no one can take him seriously. The Japanese guy and the ex-military bird just speeding around Germany in a super-car. The two Brazilians gambling in Monaco........

For a team of people who wanted to just disappear, they managed to annihilate a whole squadron of police cars, assault Brazil's maximum security police station, destroy half of Rio, Kill about 40+ police officers and then for their retirement, buying the rarest cars in the world ( always the best way to lie low for a while)..........which government in the world wouldn't seriously just unleash the death squads against them after the above.??????? Hopfully, this is the end of this terrible franchise and hopefully the end of most actors careers in this steaming pile of you know what.

Watch at your own peril",Instantdeath,4/23/11,2011
58,8,Possibly the best entertainment value this year,"I'm not sure if this being my first exposure to the ""Fast"" franchise makes any difference to my reception of ""Fast Five"" (dropping of ""Furious"" duly noted). Somehow I doubt it would.

The movie starts with the couple Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and Mai Toretto's (Jordnan Brewster) rescue (choice of word, while politically incorrect, is deliberate) her brother Dominic, or ""Dom"" (Vin Diesel) on his way in a police vehicle to serve a 25-year jail term. Next comes a fast cut to Rio de Janeiro (where the rest of the movie takes place), a quick establishing scene, and then the couple at work again, teaming up with some local gangs to steal a handful of mega-dollar cars from a train. What this amounts to is that in less than 15 minutes into the movie, the audience is entertained with two separate sequences of fast and furious action. And the movie hasn't even really begun! This is what I mean by best entertainment value. The meat of the movie is a heist yarn, robbery of a top-security vault in a police station, multi-millions held on behalf of the top local gangster king pin! Outlandishly incredible? Obviously, the movie makers don't think so, at least not in Brazil.

I wouldn't bother trying to list the movies in this genre but I cannot recall a single one in which assembling of the ""team"" takes place only after 45 minutes into a 130-minute movie. The team of about ten people, a colourful multi-ethnic mix, is only one of the four power groups involved. There is the most powerful local gangster, together with the corrupt local police, as mentioned. Not quite ""an American in Paris"", there is an American in Rio, the toughest guy found anywhere in this universe – one Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), vowed to hunt down Dom and bring him to justice. The Titanic duel (including one scene in a very literal sense) between the two is something to behold. There is one more group, albeit with little screen time, of local criminals who are Dom's friends.

Taiwanese director Justin Lin is getting really good with his craft. Car chase is obviously the top draw. Just as you wonder what else he can give you that you haven't seen before, he comes up with things that take you to yet another level of mindless pleasure. He also does exceedingly well in handling an almost unmanageable proliferation of characters. The 130-minute length helps but most of it is devoted to sequence after sequence of exciting action scenes. What is left, however, he uses deftly to make each character stand out from the blur, but without overdoing it.

Rather than taking another page to go into all these little niceties this movie offers, I'd just say that ""Fast Five"" is the best entertainment value money can buy so far this year.",harry_tk_yung,5/12/11,2011
59,7,"Dumb, over the top and stretching every ounce of suspension of belief at times... but what did you expect from this franchise?","I will start with the overall statement to sum this film up within the franchise... Its the best of the five in my opinion.I could easily go to town on the film and reel off a list of elements that would be considered negative for this film, such as clich√©d dialogue and outlandish scenes that ask you to suspend belief in reality to avoid finding more holes than a sieve.But why should i have to? This is what i would call a 'dumb summer blockbuster', a little slice of escapism and within a genre (action) that doesn't need to play it safe or play it to total reality. The dialogue will have you either grinning at the cheese of it all or putting your head in your hands at times, but if these meat headed characters had said it any more eloquently you wouldn't buy into the persona of who they are portraying. Dwayne Johnson's character of Hobbs is the stand out one, having all the best quotable lines and playing the super cop who is by the book to the bitter end as well as any you might have seen before. He is the rival to the untouchable anti hero character of Dom that Vin Deisel has growled for every film up to this point. You are meant to not hate Hobbs but at the same time i found an unintentional element of him having the funnier lines and being so over the top was that i was rooting for him over Dom and the gang at times! Now what i think must be noted is that when the franchise began it was simply a 'fast cars' film, very 2 dimensional but functional in its delivery. And while it didn't need 5 films in its run to have made it to the 5th film there was no way they could have flogged the same idea over and over and hope for the best. I applaud the thought process with the script to try and change settings and plot details, even though some of the films didn't work, and by raising the stakes in the jeopardy for the characters makes more sense as they seemingly try to top the last storyline. They have unfortunately by having this mini renaissance within the franchise not taken it as a good last hurrah to their story,going out on a high, and now think the franchise has new life to churn out another with the characters that dragged this film up from mediocre to fun entertainment. Had they stopped there they might have got away with it. While i cant predict the outcome of the 6th film, i do fear they will over emphasise the unintentionally successful parts of fast five and ruin both films in the process.But for now at least, an enjoyable 7/10",Generic_Gooner,7/17/11,2011
60,10,Fast 5 - Awesome!!!,"Saw this last night. It felt like the whole film was taken back to the original storyline with the best parts from all of the others combined. Full of excitement, fantastic race scenes, fights, thrills, mystery and a good storyline to boot. Although I felt ""Suki"" was missing, they have picked the best of the whole list of characters and bought them all together in one film with a surprising good addition from ""The Rock"".At 1st I thought he might alter my perspective with his acting abilities but hats off to the man, he played his part well and added a crucially good character to the film, one to push Toretto to the limits.The whole production shouted ""here we are, this is the story as it was meant to be"" and not detracted as in the Tokyo Drift version, even though I actually enjoyed it for a film in it's own rights.there are, as always, parts of the film that have the imagination pushing believable limits but fuelled with the youth rush of excitement, you take it for what it is, enjoyable scenes with stretched reality that in all honesty, fits perfectly well within the story.The only criticism I would offer is one that leaves the average fan missing the end. As an Avid enthusiast, I saw the WHOLE film.",r-anderson-3,4/22/11,2011
61,7,Gas Pedal to Full Throttle,"Race cars speeding along the street of Rio De Jainero, All Cast members come together all at once, the rooftop chasing and ultimate gun shooting, what more can you ask? Here it comes the fifth installment of ""The Fast and the Furious"" (2001) franchise, thiz is actually the bridging story between ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" (2006) and is a direct connection to the ending scenes of ""Fast & Furious"" (2009), when Dom (Vin Diesel) was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison and Brian's gang (Paul Walker) attempt to free him again. Justin Lin directs thiz sequel with identical pace and tone from previous movies. Just like the previous F & F movies, it's all about high speed car racing, hot sexy babes and some of cat and mouse criminal activities. Well, to tell you the truth, thiz time is more like a heist movie than car race movie. We will find very less of eye-catching race cars, the movie puts aside many glamour factors, to do otherwise they step on the gas pedal to full throttle into pure action. Frankly, I don't know for sure, who are the real ""Fast Five"" in thiz movie. Certainly, the focus is still on two central characters Dom and Brian. The rest are Dom's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster), the big mouth Roman (Tyrese Gibson), the high tech mechanic Tej (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges), the big muscle Vince (Matt Schulze), the beautiful driver Gal (Gisele Harabo) and the charismatic Sung Kang (Han Lue) from ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"". One thing for sure, there are more than five people. Thiz time they will face a well-matched opponent, the ambitious Federal Agent Luke Hobbs who is presented by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson! Thiz seems to be a great selection. The Rock delivers a strong and believable tough guy performance, I'm beginning to think thiz WWE's sensation could be a great serious Actor as well. On the other hand, Vin Diesel performs one round of WWE's wrestling scene with The Rock. It's pretty entertaining to see two giant muscles brutally clash with each other in bare hand fight. Thiz time it comes to my mind, if Vin Diesel would also be one hell of great wrestler in WWE's ring? With all the hype and enthusiasm around, thiz is clearly not the last F & F movie to be made, they will be back to do their things again. Thiz implicit confirmation is exposed in one of Hobb's famous lines, ""We'll find 'em, we take 'em as a team and we bring 'em back. And above all else, we don't ever, ever let them get into cars (again)"".Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",jonnyfendi,6/15/11,2011
62,9,Fast Five (2011) - The Biggest Thrill in the Whole Series!,"The fifth installment of the hit ""Fast and the Furious"" franchise, ""Fast Five"", is bigger, better, thrilling, amazing, and it's so entertaining. This story is set in Rio de Janeiro, right after the events of the fourth movie, where Dominic Toretto, Mia Toretto, and Brian O' Connor teams up with everyone from the previous movies, to plan a $100,000,000 heist from the most powerful hit-man in all of Rio, without being caught by Agent Lucas Hobbs. The action is exhilarating, and it kept me on the edge of my seat, wanting for more. The plot is remarkable, and it has a heart of gold contained with drama and action. The cast of Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, ""Ludacris"", and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, who stole the show for his new performance as Agent Lucas Hobbs, was all quite spectacular, and they brought thrilling and heartwarming characters. Justin Lin was the perfect director to arrange such a movie like this, with all the action, the timing, and the energy. The cinematography and editing is super challenging and enjoying, and the script by Chris Morgan is a heart of gold. The directing is top-notch, the action is exhilarating, the cast is perfect, the plot is excellent, and the finale blends with a perfect notch of surprise. ""Fast Five"" is known as an epic, thrilling, funny, heartwarming, and excellent movie that I was entertained with all that high non-stop thrills and chills. ""Fast Five"", in my review, ""an exhilarating thrill ride, with a story to die for"".",nickmesafilms,10/7/11,2011
63,6,Dumb and cheesy - But who cares?,"I can honestly not remember the last time I have seen this much testosterone on screen. Jesus. The plot is sketchy as hell and the pace is way too fast - you can hold a frame for more than a few seconds can't you? Furthermore all the men are constantly covered, and a lot of the time dripping of sweat. They are unsaved and rugged as hell. The women on the other hand are all 10's, though the poor souls seem to be suffering from anorexia and bulimia at the same time - and unlike the guys they are basically always clean and in full make-up. Basically every male teenagers dream. In fact I'd probably have loved it if I was 13. And you know what - despite all the ridiculousness and the extreme cheese factor it's actually quite fun.It's definitely a step down from the last flick, which actually managed to have a good plot and above passable acting - this seemed like an extreme rush job. ""Run over there, say your lines, and look cool - there will be NO retakes!!! - We need the money for special effects"" - is what I imagine must have been said quite often on this set. I'll give you one thing, it will make one heck of a video game - and damn did they manage to squeeze a lot into 130 mins - no clue why they cared to make it this long - but who cares.I can't really give it a bad rating. Despite a lot of poor acting, botched lines, a seemingly immortal henchman, and all that's mentioned above it actually managed to be really entertaining. Maybe it's my inner-thirteen year old that's talking but I give this movie 6/10.",Gloede_The_Saint,5/6/11,2011
65,7,Fun!,"'Fast Five', the fifth film in the The Fast and the Furious franchise, offers entertainment.

68,1,Total braindeath,"I saw this movie with expectations. The IMDb score were at the time 7.9, so I thought that this movie would be pretty good, but trust me, its not! What bothers me the most about this movie is the extreme stupidity and lack of logic. For example, in the beginning of the movie the team is raiding a train to steal cars located in the last carriage. A few carriages a head there are some police officers. They don't hear when the team uses blow torches to open the wall of the train carriage containing the cars resulting in the whole carriage wall ripping of, but when 1 shot is fired inside the carriage containing the cars, they suddenly get aware of the raid. Another example is when some characters are chased by police officers on some rooftops and vigorously time after time survives 30 feet jumps from rooftops down to the concrete street without a scratch. However, the most unrealistic and stupid scene is a car chase in the end of the movie. I wont spoil it for you but trust me, you will laugh or cry as all the laws of physic and logic are boldly defied.",DaXia,5/7/11,2011
70,6,Still fast but Not so furious!!,"With faster Cars, hot girls, great action sequences, the return of many characters from the previous versions of the franchise, Vin Diesel vs The Rock Dwayne Johnson-the two big bald heads of Hollywood going at each other in the back drop of gritty, narrow streets of Brazil-this fifth movie of the franchise had all the ingredients to make this the best one in the series.But unfortunately it is let down by a poor story and poorer acting by surprisingly everyone in the cast (except for the cars, of course). There has been an attempt to intentionally make every scene too tense and every dialogue a ""one liner"", which wasn't necessary.But, with the basic essence of the movie(the cars, the chases & great action) still retained, fans of the franchise will still love it. Overall, this movie still makes a pleasant viewing and is definitely better than the previous version.",Anil_kmar,4/21/11,2011
74,6,the first 30 minutes gets a 10/10 then...,"I always get nervous when a movie trailer is a 10/10 in awesomeness...because nine times out of ten the movie doesn't live up to it. It's just sad because there are such little stupid things that could have been done differently to make this movie better.First of all...The acting is awful! I like Paul Walker a lot but how does he keep progressively getting worse as an actor? On top of that he's supposed to be growing up and becoming brothers/partners with Vin but the script has Paul fawning for his attention like a little girl.Remove Tyrese and Luda from the movie, get a REAL bad guy, improve upon Paul and Vins acting, Shorten the movie, more cars and less lame one - liners! I can't just blame the director or the actors for a bad script. Trying to write in actors to make the 2 biggest mistakes of the franchise make sense? NO! We just want to forget those movies and move on!This is basically what happens when a movie is rushed and put together poorly. I would have gladly waited till august to see this to give them a few more months to get things right. Oh well. This movie did really kick off the summer with those exciting action scenes though!",cmtg30,4/29/11,2011
78,6,Justin Lin and Chris Morgan are just what the franchise needed,"This is the fifth movie in the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise. Fifth. You'd think the franchise would burn out by the third film and drift into direct-to-video territory like so many unfortunate film franchises today (here's looking at you, American Pie), but Fast Five sort of breaks the taboo and proves that, even at the fifth movie, it can still be entertaining and appealing as hell.Sure the acting and screenplay aren't exactly Oscar worthy, but for this genre it does the job great. Vin and Paul, along with many of the reunited cast of the franchise (Matt Schulze, Tyrese, Ludicrous, Sung Kang, Gal Gadot among others) make for a damn good action team, and the nostalgic value of seeing these different sequel's characters teaming up and joking around is one of the best aspects of the film. Oh, that and seeing Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel duke it out mano-e-mano, to see who is the better tough guy.Chris Morgan and Justin Lin are to take credit here. The first movie was solid, but light on acting and story. The second movie was just dumb. The third movie in which Lin and Morgan joined in, was a bit dull but still kept some interesting bits. The fourth movie reunited the original cast members but it felt a bit boring due to some story developments, but hey, you can't blame them for trying.This time around, however, Lin and Morgan improved a lot. Morgan tweaks with the sequel, transforming it into a heist film rather than the first and third films which focused on racing, and the second and fourth films which focused on getting a badder criminal. In this sequel the baddie is a corrupt politician/gang leader played by Joaquim de Almeida (Bucho from ""Desperado"") so you know he's going to be a really nasty villain. The characters are now quite fleshed out and interact more with each other, showing a more older and vulnerable side of them since the last time we saw them in previous films.Lin shows off his (improved) knack for action sequences. There are some really good stuff to be seen here, one of which involves a train and the other which involves the near-total destruction of the streets of Rio de Janeiro. What is impressive is that most, if not all of these action sequences are shot live-action as opposed to CGI (I never liked the climax involving CG tunnels in the fourth movie). While there are few racing scenes, the last action set-piece, is truly a sight to behold. It is preposterous, yet utterly exciting and hilarious to watch due to the truly amazing stunt work put together by Lin and crew. I've never seen destruction this frenzied and exciting since James Bond's pleasant tank drive in St. Petersburg in ""GoldenEye"".It has to be said anyway - this is the best of the franchise, hands down. Morgan and Lin took the franchise to a different and quite mature direction, and let's hope the sixth (yes, it was mentioned a week ago) will be as good, if not better, than this one. This is great entertainment and a solid start to the summer.P.S. Stay after the first part of the credits. Trust me.Overall rating: 73/100",dvc5159,5/6/11,2011

Tugging of a container with two cars and rampage the entire city is too much fantasy that anyone can laugh about it and say Mexican's please wake up and do something about your country otherwise you will be perished in this world. Reviews should be logical and not that it s a good movie or a bad one. Mr Vin Diesel is just pulling up the legacy of first movie.

It's not because of Vin Diesel or Paul Walker - I love the cars and the action. These films never disappoint and certainly not this one. Without trying to ruin the film - there are a few shocks, but you will only understand them if you have seen the other films. I really advise anyone to go watch this film, you will not regret it!

Not only does he return again and again to the franchise (it's his third time at the helm), but he brings back a lot of people you'll recognize from the previous movies.That of course means, that you might want to freshen up your memory and re-watch the previous movies. Yes even the ""Tokyo Drift"" one! A new face is Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson of course. And while he's not quite Tommy Lee Jones (as seen in ""The Fugitive""), he brings a lot to this movie! All the actors do not count of course, if the action isn't right. And you have some very nice set pieces here, very well choreographed. A real fun ride then. Of course you can tell that this won't be the last one (stay and watch until the end credits roll through to get a tag end/scene), so I do wonder, since the title get smaller and smaller, will they call the next one ""F-Six""? And then ""F7""?! But until then, enjoy the movies as much as you can :o) (just don't try it at home/on the streets yourself!)",kosmasp,12/26/11,2011
90,1,What a steaming pile of crap!,"I just don't understand how people can give this anything above 3/10. Its just so ridiculously stupid on so many levels it would take me the whole day to write up whats wrong with this film if you want to call it that. The acting is extremely poor as expected, many scenes are extremely cheesy and clich√©. The stunts are so grossly unrealistic that it pisses me off that they even try and make us believe this sh*t is even remotely possible. It's just as realistic as having them fly around like superman and creating antimatter out of their asses.This whole movie is just dumb on too many levels and those who enjoyed it are equally dumb! I want 2 hours of my life back!",triscope,5/5/11,2011
91,8,it was a little bit less than perfect,"well what can I say??? EXTRAORDINARY!!! every F&F is better than the previous! the best thing about this movie is that characters from all previous movies join powers!! :DD Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang even Eva Mendes (for 1 min only)

the only thing that didn't let me put the !10! is that there were no Illegal Races and not a big variety of cars basically it is more like an action movie with a lot of chasing in the streets of Rio than a film with SPEED and EXCITING races like F&F 1 and 3. In addition Dwayne Johnson was not so ""in"" the role

it is a MUST WATCH for every Fast and Furious fan but anyone who like action movies can be delighted!

Overally: The greatest Fast and Furious movie so far so i give it a 9/10 can't wait for No.6",cmvaggs,9/1/11,2011
92,6,"Cars, Muscles, and Muscle Cars","Forgive my ignorance of the ""Fast and Furious"" films. Believe it or not, this fifth installment is the first I've seen in its entirety. I could generally care less about car culture and only just learned how to change my own oil. The closest I come to drifting is in ""Mario Kart."" I am not the target audience. But as the producers have apparently exhausted street racing tropes, they've pimped the franchise out to the masses. Color me impressed, it actually works.

""Fast Five"" may be brainless action, but at least it's the type that revels in its own ridiculousness. The genre has lately fallen into a self-serious slump, teeming with stern- faced heroes who don't enjoy saving the world one bit. Conversely and to all appearances, Vin Diesel and company couldn't be having a better time tearing up the streets of Rio de Janeiro. Sometimes a fast car and a toothy grin is all you need.

Director Justin Lin obviously appreciates the simple and satisfying marriage of physical stunt work and compelling cinematography. Granted, it's no master's course in action filmmaking, but his use of the camera to transfer momentum is undeniably effective. Particularly impressive are his opening and closing chase sequences, in which he employs CGI sparingly in favor of real vehicles and visceral wrecks. Smartly favored in the trailer, ""Fast Five"" is bookended by an hour of easy escapism.

The problem is everything in between. No one was expecting Shakespeare, but Lin and screenwriter Chris Morgan should have at least dog-eared the bit about brevity being the soul of wit. At two hours 10 minutes, ""Fast Five"" is longer than it has any earthly business being. The bloated running time allows for some presumably obligatory street races and more tiresome exposition than you can shake a stick shift at.

Hours seem to wither away in a dimly lit garage where story beats are spoon-fed to the audience. Get on with it; ""Fast Five"" is a ""one last job"" heist film with few surprises. Whole swaths of the story could be cut—they exist solely to justify more drag races, fistfights, and shootouts. Morgan also relies on cheap, microwavable drama in his peripheral storytelling: an unexpected pregnancy and leftfield romances add little depth to the proceedings. Having his characters emote plays to nobody's strengths.

Thankfully, the charisma of the cast buoys any less than Oscar-worthy performances. Diesel comes off surprisingly empathetic as the muscle-bound mastermind of the hundred million dollar heist. Along the way, he spars with a gargantuan federal agent played by The Rock, and calls in help from a colorful cast of returning characters, including an ex-rival (Paul Walker), his sister (Jordana Brewster), a smooth-talker (Tyrese Gibson), and a safecracker (Ludacris).

Despite its lulls, ""Fast Five"" kicks the summer off right. With more judicious pacing, it might have been the perfect Saturday afternoon snack, but junk food necessitates a conservative serving size. Lin's overlong film is fortunately punctuated by the sort of tangible high-octane action that has become a rarity in the age of CGI superpowers and spell craft. Even if you're as unfamiliar with the franchise as I was yesterday, you'll likely find this fifth installment immediately accessible and intermittently fun. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a date with my 2001 automatic transmission Toyota Camry.",colinrgeorge,5/4/11,2011
93,9,have to admit..wasn't expecting this film to be good..but i enjoyed it thoroughly.,"Everyone use to talk about how they are excited to watch fast five, but I wasn't really that excited about it. I've seen all the fast and furious films and I though it would be the same, but then I watched the trailer..then the film and absolutely loved it. I loved how the film has a bit of romance, comedy, action... so basically every genre and likes how every second of the film was very exciting and not boring. Also, I loved the fact that Paul Walker cleaned himself up a bit, because it the other fast and furious films, he was not that hot, but it fast five he looked smoking hot.

Also....jordana brewster and paul walker are smoking hot together!! :) I would actually recommend people to watch this because it is the best film of 2011 so far.",amy-john99,5/25/11,2011
97,8,A Fantastic Summer Thrill Ride,"Personally, I have never been a huge fan of the Fast and the Furious franchise. The first film was a fun piece of dumb popcorn entertainment, bolstered by strong action, some awesome stunts and Vin Diesel's intimidating presence. Then Diesel vanished, and the series took a downward dive in ""quality"". I really disliked 2 Fast 2 Furious, and I hated the third instalment, Tokyo Drift. Diesel's return in the fourth film, Fast and Furious, signalled a definite improvement over 2 and 3, but still didn't match the original. So it's fair to say that I went into Fast Five with mixed expectations. And I'm pleased to say that I came out with a smile on my face.

The plot for this one goes a little something like this. Picking up from the ending of the last film. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) and Mia Torretto (Jordana Brewster) free Dom Torretto (Diesel) from the transport taking him to prison. Next time we see them, they're hiding out in Rio. However, when a job goes badly wrong, they find themselves being hunted by corrupt businessman Herman Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). To get both payback and freedom, they call on other characters from the series (Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Chris ""Ludicrous"" Bridges) from 2 Fast, Han from Tokyo Drift etc) to help them in a bid to steal of Reyes' money. However, they're also being chased by tough-as-nails Federal Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), who's never lost a convict

Simply put, Fast Five is a near-perfect piece of summer entertainment. I was hugely surprised by just how pumped up this film left me feeling. I walked out of the cinema feeling energetic and excited, something which I truly didn't expect when I walked into the cinema to watch it. When a summer movie makes me have that kind of reaction to it, I personally think that it has done a great job. When we go to a summer movie, first and foremost we want to be entertained. That is something that Fast Five achieves in spades.

That is mostly due to the insane action sequences and stunts in this movie. The stunt team deserve BIG props for some of the things we see on screen here. Right from the get-go, when we see a bus collide with a car and flip while the car is pretty much unscathed, the filmmakers are telling you to leave your brain at the door. If you can do that, the action in here is fantastic. If you're looking forward to some street racing though, you may be disappointed. An early train robbery is brilliantly paced, edited and loud; if you're a fan of the series, the carnage will leave a huge grin on your face. If you're a newcomer, just embrace the absurdity and your grin will be almost as wide. A nicely- done foot chase through the favelas quickly follows, although it does bear unfavourable comparisons to a similar, better executed scene from The Incredible Hulk. But in the final 45 minutes, the filmmakers slam the accelerator on this baby. There's a fist fight between Diesel and Johnson which is worth the ticket price alone, a gunfight which echoes Black Hawk Down and the final, awesomely implausible chase, with two cars dragging a safe (no, I'm not going mad) the size of a wrecking ball through the streets of Rio. It's audacious, spectacular and fun as hell. If you are one of those unstoppable cynics, you will probably walk out at this point, tutting as you go. If you just go for the ride, you'll have a blast. I was personally grinning like the Cheshire Cat.

But the most surprising thing for me was how much I enjoyed the scenes between the action set-pieces. Whereas the acting is nothing spectacular, all of the returning actors have settled into their roles by now and have an unforced, easy-going relationship with each other. I actually really liked the good guys in this, and I wanted them to succeed. Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous, in particular, are hilarious, their rapport with each other and the other members of Dom's crew providing a lot of great laughs throughout. There are a surprising amount of witty, funny one-liners, and most of them go to these two. Walker is decent (if still a bit wooden), and Brewster, as well as being astonishingly beautiful, actually does a effective job of making Mia a vulnerable yet strong character, instead of just window dressing. Diesel, as always, brings his dominant presence to bear; you can immediately sense why the rest of the gang is willing to face these risks for him. As the new villain, de Almeida is suitably slimy and nasty enough to make you want to see the gang beat him. But the big introduction in this movie is obviously that of The Rock. Striding into the movie like a testosterone- driven bloodhound, The Rock puts all of those shameful kid flicks such as The Game Plan and The Tooth Fairy behind him and returns to his masculine roots, sliding effortlessly into the series and delivering a new jolt of life in the process.

Overall, Fast Five delivered almost everything I wanted from a summer movie. There are problems; the street racing sequences feel like afterthoughts, the relationship between Dom and a Brazilian cop (Elsa Pataky) isn't developed enough whilst the filmmakers use a few too many panning shots across an otherwise beautiful Rio. But other than that, director Justin Lin, the cast and crew have delivered a hugely entertaining action flick. Based on the mid-credits clip, there might be a sequel. I never thought I'd say this, but if this is one, I will definitely go and see it. Summer is off to a flying start.",TheUnseenMovieLover,4/27/11,2011

100,6,Too Much Quantity & Less Quality,"this movie is the 5th installation in the series of fast & the furious..the first 4 maybe good or not but this on is a big let down. don know how it became a hit.only because of the rock(D-Johnson) & Vin Diesel. the plot shows that these people are planning something big & want to get big money.how they do it & how they escapes the cops & bad guys.the director showed too much of style,action & talking of the heist. but the story is filmed badly..i am sorry i did not like it.& in the end the cop(the rock) a fight here & there.cars,racing,money & other crap.its written by a kid i guess.a script full of foolishness.

they get the container in the end & boom Vin diesel goes crazy with his car smashing everything..they are dragging that heavy container full of cash with wires & how the hell can it go too fast.

unrealistic but i support Vin diesel still for him i say give it a chance guys.

The movie starts well, but ..the tension between Brian oConner and Dominuq Toretto is just not there anymore and this makes the whole movie bland.. soon u find yourself in a completely unoriginal plot..aka almost identical to the plot from ""the Losers"" , ""The expendabels"" and so many others..just with the plot holes as above and a worse story and more boring....when the action starts it gets ridiculous quickly...I like fast and furious I and IV..this one was the worst of the serious.",rogerg100,5/18/11,2011
106,7,"Too Stupid, Too Fun","Some films can be so idiotic that an audience will become insulted by their ineptitude (see The Last Airbender or Sucker Punch). But some films can be so idiotic that an audience will start giggling at how ridiculous the whole thing can be. Thankfully, the fifth outing in the decade-old Fast and Furious franchise falls in the latter category as an enjoyable, popcorn-munching thrill ride.The film begins with where the last one left off: Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is carted off to jail but is busted en route to prison by his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) and her boyfriend / Dom's now friendly rival, Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker). After escaping the US, the trio find themselves in Brazil but end up pissing off the kingpin of the favelas in Rio, Hernan Reyes (Joaquin de Almeida). Even with a brutal DSS agent (The Rock) on their tail, the Torettos and O'Connor decide to get back at Reyes and pull off a heist with a cash winnings of $100 million. So they recruit nearly all their friends from the previous four movies (including Ludicrous, Tyrese Gibson, Don Omar, Sung Kang, Matt Schulze, Tego Calderon, Gal Gadot) to ban together and pull off an insane robbery plan.From this little plot summary, you can already tell this is really not the most serious action film out there. And thankfully, the actors and director do not take it so seriously either, that they start to have so much fun with what they have. It does seem that the film tries a little too hard to make you like your main characters even though they are all thieves. For instance, Dom is frequently portrayed as a church-going, fiercely loyal friend despite being able to wreck anybody that gets in his way. But it's par for the course and it allows to confidently root for him and his team, even when their villain is so cartoonishly evil that he can't be taken seriously. But as I said, seriousness is not the order of the day. Fun is all there is on the menu, and the actors are able to support that fun just the same. The dialogue is peppered with pretty silly lines for the three leads, but they each deliver them with such deadpan seriousness that you almost begin to wonder if they are intentionally trying to make you laugh. However, the dialogue does fall flat many times, and I was kind of hoping with such a ridiculous premise that dialogue could keep up with it. Sadly, that didn't happen. The middle of the film also drags on a bit with a notable lack of action, but this is made up with some funny exchanges between the characters who have some great chemistry.Meanwhile Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous have fun exchanges throughout the film, as do Don Omar and Tego Calderon. Gal Gadot and Matt Schulze don't add much to the mix, but they're fine with what they are given. I was really wishing to see more of Sung Kang as Han from Fast and Furious 3: Tokyo Drift (the ONLY good part about the movie), but even he delivers some fun lines as well. But no exchange was making my audience crack up more than watching The Rock and Vin Diesel trying to out-Man the other guy. Even more so when their big fist fight in the film disregards physics.Speaking of which, I'm pretty sure the director, Justin Lin, must really enjoy flicking off pictures of Isaac Newton, because physics do not exist in this world. In this film, he has two guys drive off a steep cliff into a river and somehow survive the impact of the fall and bare men can break through the walls of favelas. The film then leads to a spectacular sequence involving two cars dragging a large safe through the streets of Rio while using it as a wrecking ball against their pursuers. It gets so ridiculous that it achieves the Bad Boys 2 effect: a film that is so aware that it's dumb, that it becomes a fun ride for all. While Fast Five cannot be called a great film with hokey dialogue and some flat characters, it does manage to entertain its audiences with the cast having great chemistry and over-the-top stunts leading the way throughout the film. Give it a look if you have an afternoon free, and enjoy the ride.",TheDarkKnight21,5/22/11,2011
107,10,An adrenaline injection that would start up a dead man,"This movie has every possible element a great action movie should have! Cars, hot girls, a decent plot, loads of action and an explosive ending that marks the beginning of another sequel. The person that thought of confronting Vin Diesel and The Rock is a mastermind, and just for the brilliance of the idea should be awarded with an Oscar. The testosterone level was, at points, so high that I was literally shouting and cheering at the TV set. Emotions are also well incorporated so the movie has depth. The characters are, even though there is a whole bunch of them (the entire FF crew from every movie in the franchise), well described, complex, and interesting. I was a little afraid that there would be too much of them at once, but boy was I wrong! Every character has it's own story told from the beginning 'till the end. The music was nicely picked but, in my opinion, there could have been a little more metal or rock (Sepultura would have been a good choice since the movie is made in Brasil). The thing that shook me entirely was the ending. The photo that Eva presents to The Rock is so shocking that I couldn't have believed my eyes! And I must say, not many movies in the last few years managed to create that sort of feeling in me. There is only one problem with the movie: it ends. Get your crew, grab as much popcorn and sodas as you can and have a blast.",matej-trkanjec-133-920386,9/3/11,2011
112,8,Fast and a lot more furious.,"For anyone who thinks this ten year old franchise might be running out of fuel, have no fear because on the basis of Fast Five, it could run for another decade. This is the longest of the five films and in my opinion, it is the best.The film contains two of the best action scenes I have seen in the franchise. Fast Five is all that you'd expect and more. However, the cars and the girls aren't quite the major players they are in previous movies but they're there nonetheless, so don't be disappointed.Fast Five sees a buffed up Dom and a loved up Brian and Mia flee to Rio after they become fugitives of US law. There they decide to do one final heist and invite some old friends back to take part. This is no ordinary heist either and involves getting on the wrong side of some extremely dangerous people.The old faces are back with Roman and Tej but it is the comedic banter of the two new faces in the team - Don Omar and Tego Calderon - that I enjoyed the most. And Sung Kang and Gal Gadot aren't just making up the numbers. She has a figure to make your eyes pop out !! For me though, the cream of the movie is the much anticipated arrival of Dwayne Johnson as Federal Agent Hobbs. He is superb and I'd be surprised if he doesn't feature strongly in the next film. His role opposite Diesel works a treat and in my opinion, neither one outdoes the other.There is more effort at plot and character development in Fast Five than previous outings and some people may be surprised at how events unfold. It might not be for the best but we will have to wait and see.Rio is the perfect setting with the sun drenched streets and alleys of the favelas as well as the constant menace of the omnipotent local drugs lords. These guys are ruthless characters and very well armed, with a stranglehold over the local law enforcement agencies too.All in all, a welcome return for everyone concerned. Keep your eyes open during the credits for some extras that you won't want to miss. I'm already looking forward to the next film. I just can't think what title they'll come up with !!",MrJRGO,5/5/11,2011

116,9,Five By Five.,"When I heard that a fifth film in the Fast And Furious franchise was getting made,I have to admit that my original feeling was one of mild interest at most.This is because I felt that when the third film in the series came out (Tokyo Drift) it seemed that the film makers had taken most of the energy out of the series,which made the film feel a lot less exciting than its predecessors.Whilst the fourth film gave the series a slight return to form,by bringing back some of the past cast members,the performances seemed to have lost something that was there in the first film,with Vin Diesels performance losing some of the charming cockiness that had made Dominic Toretto such a engaging character.When my friend saw some clips of the film,that showed The Rock was going to have a big role in the film,he (who is also a big fan of this series) was instantly looking forward to seeing this film.And for my self,I felt that since this was Rocks first ""big budget"" non-Disney film in a long time,and that it seemed from some of the clips I had seen that, the cast and crew had found their passion again for the series.This got me to start thinking the this was a film that could really surprise me...

plot: Arriving to Rio De Janeiro to meet up again with street-racer Dominic Toretto,who they have recently help escape from jail,Brian O'Conner and Dominics sister Mia are surprised to find that he is no where to be seen.When they visit one of there's (and Dominics) mutual friends (Vince),they are surprised to discover that Vince needs them to help him with a planned robbery of a very valuable car, that is being transported in a highly secure train.As the team start to ambush the train,Dominc makes a surprise arrival,and starts to help the others to literally rip a carriage of the train into two!.When the gang get on to the remaining parts of the train,they are shocked that along with the big amount of thugs that are trying to keep the car secure,there are also a good number of ""off-duty"" DEA agents there as well.Realiseing that time is running out,Vince tells the gang that they have to only steal one of the cars.Whilst the gang try to get away,three of the DEA agents are killed in the cross-fire between the thugs and Dominics gang.After having spilt up and seeming to be safe,Dominic and O'Conner are suddenly captured by the most powerful boss in the De Janeiro underworld (Hernan Reyes) who questions them for hours about where they have hidden the car,When they both at last escape from Reyes hideout,they go to meet up with Mia,whose been keeping the car hidden in a safe house.To an extremely angry Dominic,Vince gives everyone the shock announcement that he knew that Reyes would do everything he can to kill each member of the gang,so that he could get hold of the car again.Vince also tells them that Hernan does not want the car itself,but what is hidden inside it (a computer chip,which has all the details of Reyes money-laundering safe houses,which he partly uses to keep the police in his control)Hearing this,Dominic tells Vince that he can not be trusted and that he must leave the gang.Vince reluctantly does,as Dominic and everyone else start to get there old friends to join them,so that they can do a huge heist,by taking every penny of Reyes dirty money.But with Hernans money now being kept safe at the main police station ,and a DSS federal agent (Luke Hobbs) now searching for them,due to all of them being framed for the murders of the agents,this heist is going to be far from easy...

View on film: For the screenplay,writer Chris Morgan brilliantly changes the format of the series,by having the cops 'n' robbers storyline that has been the main plot (s) of the series,instead become a fun secondary story,with the main plot line instead being about a huge heist.Morgans brilliant script keeps the film moving at a fantastic pace, with the clever introduction of (all the main) characters from the last four films being woven together into a team that any viewers of the past films will be unable to not let a big grin go across their face,Morgan also smartly makes it that each member of the team plays a vital part in the mission going successfully. Whilst he may have reallied on CGI effects a bit too much the last few times,director Justin Lin brings the film back to it roots with a BANG.Although some of the things that are used for the heist (such as the pulling cables) seem to have come straight out of Chris Morgans script for Wanted,Lin makes the amazing action scenes extremely gripping by having the epic heist chase feel very rough and raw,with the beautiful Brazil location being completely destroyed into dust!.Although he sadly delivers his last few lines (which I hope are there to show that he will be returning for the next films)in a more joking manner,when the character really needed to show some real aggression,Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is still able to give his best performance that I have seen from him in years,with Johnson making your eyes transfix on the screen,as he shows an unforgettable amount of charisma,that turned him into an icon in his previous job as, Luke Hobbs tears everything (and everyone) apart so that he can get closer to finding out about what is really happening in Rio.Along with having one of the best on screen fights of the year with Johnson,Vin Diesel gives a fantastic,real return-to-form performance as Dominic.Diesel shows that even though Dominic is older,he is still able to keep his quick-witted ideas and fearlessness burning,when everyone else has run out of fuel,although Diesel also smartly shows that Dominic is more open to listening to other peoples plans and compromising, than he ever was before.",morrison-dylan-fan,4/22/11,2011

Romance is kept to a minimum, a must for action movies, and the next chase, gun fight etc. is just a couple minutes away. The 110 minutes on the screen went by in a flash, another indication of how great this movie is. I've been to movies where 2 hours seem like 2 days.

119,7,Unbelievable extreme popcorn fun.,"Unbelievable because most of it's action sequences and events would not happen in real life. But hey it's a movie so I enjoyed them big time. Am I supposed to believe that 2 guys are able to take down all the corrupt policemen from Rio? Yeah right. What about The Rock's character? He was FBI's best man and in the end allowed our dynamic duo to escape.

I know. But the movie gave me exactly what I expected: pure adrenaline and kickass scenes. There are plenty of great action sequences involving shootings, chasings, fights (the fight between Vin Diesel and The Rock is epic!), excellent car chases and more.

Character wise, the movie is somewhat clichéd. The ""fast & furious"" team is filled with one-liner characters that deliver some comedic moments.

The romantic moments were not necessary at all but come on! It was entertaining.

This movie should please those who want non-stop action and plenty of macho moments. If you're looking for a serious cop movie, look elsewhere.

120,10,5 times better than all the others,"this movie is no doubt the best fast and furious out of the whole series. its also longer out of them all. two hours and ten minutes. which got me worried at first. i thought it would drag on to much. but it didn't. they knew how to make this movie good. in this movie they brought back stars from the previous fast and furious films. and added a new main character. they brought back tyrese Gibson from 2 fast 2 furious, sung kang form fast and furious Tokyo drift, ludicrous from 2 fast 2 furious, gal gadot from fast and furious and of course the originals Vin diesel Paul walker and Jordana Brewster. since Brian went on to Dom's team they need a new cop. thats were Dwayne Johnson comes in. he plays Luke Hobbs, a bounty hunter looking for Dom and his team. Dwayne Johnson's character is completely different from Paul walkers character. Luke Hobbs is buff, tough, sense of humor is somewhat lacking, and can fight. since Vin diesel and Dwayne Johnson are in the same movie, there's got to be a fight. which there was. Hobbs vs. Dom. this is the first time someone is equally matched to Dom. and the fight was amazing. there were the hot babes to. the only thing i don't like is that there was only one race in the movie. they used cars just no for racing. but the race has the stars racing against each other for fun. it has comedy, drama, romance, mystery, suspense, and brings thrills all the way through. no doubt see it",edwbur,5/1/11,2011

I think the whole movie was for a fight between Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson. I really don't know how this movie got 7.8 rating. Never trust a movie with the so called American heroes.,itzzarun,5/12/11,2011
123,8,I thought it was pretty good.,"I thought it was pretty good. I saw it in a hotel room, and ended up watching the whole thing even though it was getting near check-out time. They just don't make movies like this anymore. Too much CGI these days.",LordGooGoo,5/8/11,2011
125,10,Absolutely Fantastic.,"I think it is safe to say that this is the best installment of the franchise.The whole movie, from the cast to the location, the action to the comedy, was spot on. Just when I thought they were leaving the whole car element out of the movie, boom, there they are. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson played a fantastic partIt's a perfect blend of the style that Ocean's Eleven adopted, in regards to bringing the best in the business in, and everything we loved about the original Fast and Furious movies.Don't even get me started on the utterly flawless twist at the end. 3/4's of the movie theatre left and didn't get to witness it after the credits, but literally, I was speechless.Brilliant movie and it should be watched by all.",steffenxo,4/22/11,2011
129,10,Don't miss this movie... fastest n most furious,"Normally, i don't write reviews for any movie here.. i am just lazy. But believe me this movie is just awesome. I am writing this review specially for those who haven't watched this movie yet. I already watched 2 times and wanna watch again n again..This movie contains the best characters from all previous F N F movies with a very tight script, jaw dropping action, hottest chicks, sexiest cars, superb locations and finally amazing soundtrack. Every scene of the story is just awesome and make u stick to your seat. Just go and watch this movie.. you don't know what r u missing. Just stay in the cinema until the end of the credits and see the what this movie secretly have in stock for you.Rating 10/10.",rick_matthew,4/24/11,2011
131,10,Excellent fast 5,"One fantastic film and the ending is a twist I never saw coming. If you are a Fast and Furious fan you will not be disappointed one bit. Full of action and good humor, and still sticking to it's roots. This film had it all. Great action, sweet rides, good on screen camaraderie, cool scenery, and beautiful woman. The plot didn't disappoint either. Everything made sense and there was no over board, unnecessary scenes. What I loved the most was the bond that Dom and Brian and Mia brought to the screen through out the film. As cool and as much action as there was, there was also some sentimental feelings briefly though out watching. I would 100% go see this movie again.",Jzzrs18,4/29/11,2011
132,6,If you like ACTION Movies ...,"this is for you! Great car scenes and fights! Okay story line and BEAUTIFUL shots of Rio de Janeiro throughout. See one of the world's most picturesque cities from a vantage point not often seen.The final ""chase scene"" is one to behold, as a large vault is dragged though the streets and the last twist makes it all memorable. If you tend to not like the nonsensical and unbelievable look for another movie, but as I said IF action is what you seek, go see Fast Five! It's also good if you're familiar with the storyline from it's previous releases and be prepared for Fast Six!",Seattle_Slew,5/21/11,2011
133,5,How to mess up an action movie,"I confess to not being a big fan of the 'Fast..."" series. I do enjoy a good action film. I didn't enjoy this one due to it exceeding my ability to suspend disbelief quotient. Cars CANNOT do those things. If you show the stars having their first hot meal in a while eating like hungry dogs, then how do they later afford the stuff they need for the 'job'?. How, in a country run by the criminal they rob, do they get fake passports? Fast Five is too full of these issues for my mind to sit there on idle. It wakes up and busts out of the jar I put it in prior to going in to thee movie, and kicks the inside of my skull. Stop it! get out now! But no, I stayed to the end. Rental Only.",NDanger,5/24/11,2011
134,8,Fast five is one heck of a ride,"You would think by the fifth movie in this franchise comes out that the wheels on this car ride would start to fall flat, but I have to say this is the best movie of the series. This car driven film series has been given a new tune up of story, reshaping of the body style of the outlook of adventure, and a high octane upgrade of action that makes the ride a bit smoother. It felt refreshing to see the director bring most of the cast from the other Fast and Furious movies together without polluting the story with too many people. There are so many changes to what we were given in the first Fast and Furious franchise that it does fill like the original film any more, but something better that is more enjoyable. It drops the drag racing and replaces it with the heist feel of the Ocean 11 films, mixed with the action of a Bad Boys movie, and car driving and plot of the Italian job. The only flaw of this movie is the acting is not as good as you think it would be after all these years, but the director does a great job of noticing this flaw and replacing it with comedy that hasn't been present in most of the movies. Also Dwayne Johnson is a great addition to the already famous cast and he fits in perfect and ups the action of the movie even more with his presence. This is what a summer movie feels like and gives",mcgriff1290,7/11/11,2011
136,9,"Very cool cars, sexy people, lots of action, and gorgeous Rio de Janeiro","Fast Five is an ocean of motion and it never lets up. It was the first movie I saw in the IMAX format and it washed over me like a tsunami.From the beginning, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), his consigliere Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), and others are stealing impounded lux cars from train packed with DEA agents while it's still operating. The cars are for Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida, always a gem), the crime boss of Rio de Janeiro. Great set piece: A big ole truck rides alongside to act as midwife to the cars as they roll from boxcar to the ground at high rates of speed. O'Conner's fighting with Reyes' henchman whose operating the industrial truck. He knocks him off and is hanging on for dear life as Toretto drives up trying to catch him before he smashes against a bridge pillar. Shot to shot to shot, he jumps, truck explodes in blaze of glory, and he and Diesel do a slo-mo dive into a raging river way down below, all three of them, Walker, Diesel and the car. The cars should have top billing. Especially the cars at the end when Roman (Tyrese Gibson) pulls up with hot babe in tow and his bud Tej (Chris 'Ludicrous' Bridges), a hard working day job man, slyly has his hot babe drive up in the same car.What's the movie about? Hot fast shiny cars, keep the motor running, sexy people (""We're a family!""), $100 million in untraceable bills and two identical bank vaults. Tyrese and Ludicrous bantering like old friends. But never forget the 3 monuments to Mother Nature, Dwayne Johnson, Vin Diesel and Rio de Janeiro. Rio should have gotten top billing as a person in its own right. The beach at Ipanema. The hills covered with colorful houses in stadium seating.Diesel's less combustible than he's been before. He's the natural leader but picks his words carefully and all his crew lean in for every word.If you like cars, sexy people, lots of action, gorgeous Rio de Janeiro, an implausibly irresistible heist and tawdry touches of Mission Impossible and Ocean's Eleven, you'll like Fast Five.",CassandraSparkles,5/4/11,2011
138,8,Faster and faster.,"Fast Five has enough machismo and testosterone to make The Expendables look subdued. It's much more of a straight up action/heist film than the previous movies, with the occasional car chase scene to remind you it's still a Fast & Furious movie (if all the returning faces aren't enough to let you know).¬†And it works. This is a really fun flick to watch in an ""Ocean's Eleven meets the gleeful carnage of a Michael Bay movie"" kind of way that's entertaining and ridiculously over-the-top. Fast Five is easily the best movie of the series, and probably one of the most exciting movies of the year. Dwayne Johnson is a perfect addition to the cast and his confrontations with Diesel's character is among the many highlights of the film, plus it's good to see the old cast members back in action. If you want an action romp that breezes by without getting to serious, looks slick, and just doesn't know what it means to slow down, this will give you all you need and more.",lewiskendell,12/2/11,2011
139,6,Fast Five deals with troubles of identity and becomes pointless but highly entertaining...,"When I first saw the first movie of this series, I said to myself ""Yes, Julian, good entertainment like never before"". After all these years, Fast Five is promoted as being the last one, the grand finale, the ultimate conclusion to the story of our horse-power rider heroes. Fast Five detach itself from the racing plague and transforms into another heist movie which bring nothing new except a few really entertaining chase scenes. So where to begin? The story starts with the planned break-out of Dominic (Vin Diesel) who was convicted for 25 years in jail. It starts with a ridiculous stunt but I got over it fastly. The group then ends up in Brasil and gets into trouble while trying to steal 3 cars from a moving train. The chase itself, the whole operation is entertaining but impossible, deadly and the last but not the least, hilarious in real life. You get the feeling you're watching scenes from 2012. However, Dom, Brian (Paul Walker), Mia (Jordana Brewster) and Vince (Matt Schulze) deal with real issues after they find out they stole an important cip which was hidden in one of the cars owned by an even more important person in Rio. The most feared and powerful drug dealer, Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). Nothing impressive wait? Oh wait. The ""FBI dudes"" from the States sent one of the best teams in Rio to catch them. This elite task is ran by Luke Hobbs (Dwyane Johnson) which is pretty much the old-school, hand-by-hand tough guy. The movie moves pretty fast. We get to find out that Mia is pregnant so of course, Dom and Briand head out for the most clicheic ""last job"" ever. They get to reunite with all their friends from the previous movies, Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson), Tej Parker (Ludacris) and Han Lue (Sung Kang). They give green lights for a plan to steal Reyes's drug money. We get the usual guy who wants to get out but once he finds out the kind of money involved he gets back in, we get to see few actual races, some nice beautiful women, big men acting all like a bunch of wrestlers and showing their muscles and we'll even get the bad guy joining the good guys. We're also given, I think, the biggest death toll in this series.As far as their plans, there's no real in-depth look. We're just given small pieces and the rest we must figure for ourselves even some matches don't fit this whole pretentious job. With all the cons we still are entertained and the last part of the movie, the final confrontation actually pays it off even if it gets a little bit cheesy with the sentimental nonsense. As for the acting part, I had one big problem with Dwyane Johnson's delivery. His lines always felt forced like he was reading the script or something. I love The Rock but I still think as an actor... he's still at the beginning.The technical part of the movie is quite impressive. Tough chase scenes, crazy stunts and good fight sequences. I had a problem with some effects like the train wagon explosion. Far from being realistic enough. I also had problems with the lightning and with the continuous and repeating use of wide-city shots between certain scenes. It's the easiest way to make a transition between scenes. It's a cinematographer weakness, especially in a movie like this which has the possibility of looking much much better. The music was pretty good, intense and fitted the atmosphere.Overall, Fast Five was a disappointment as far as a Fast & Furious movie. Fast Five was a disappointment as far as an overall heist movie because of the overused clicheic pieces of story. Fast Five was a disappointment as far as the ridiculous action scenes in it. Despite all that, despite the negative view I have on it I must admit I was entertained. It was a good time. Now, Fast Five deals with troubles of identity. It feels like the last one but it leaves room for another one. And since we already know they'll make another one I have some questions? Why the misleading marketing? Why the misleading point of the movie? Why did they had to make it pointless?",montera_iulian,5/29/11,2011
140,8,Getting Better With Age,"The Fast and the Furious franchise seems to be getting better with age. The first on was a good movie. Then the second one came out which was average at best than Toyko Drift came out and that was just plan terrible. I considered the franchise dead after that but then I saw Fast and the Furious and it gave life to the franchise. It's rare to see a franchise getting better with age. Usually Things start to go down hill after the second movie of a franchise. From the Lethal Weapon movies, to the Terminator movies and of course all of the horror genre. So it's surprisingly rare for a franchise to survive the test of time and you wouldn't expect this franchise to be one of them and Fast Five might be the best movie of them all.

Fast Five has a above average story. Starting almost directly after the first one. The overall story is about the core group trying to find a way out of the endless running from the law and family. There's another plot about a drug lord and a missing computer chip but it isn't very good. That shouldn't matter to most simply because you don't go to see this type of movie for a amazing story and great acting. You coming to see the great action, cool cars, and hot women. You get plenty of all three in this. Still I'd say this is the best story of all the movies since the first one.

The acting OK but look at the actors none of the are great actors and none of them are going to win Oscars in their acting career. Still all the actors from Paul Walker to Tyrese Gibson to Sung Kang to Dwayne Johnson aka THE ROCK are having a good time and have great chemistry which makes up for the acting.

Now for what everyone goes to these movies for the action. Which is mind blowing. From a scene where a group steal cars from a moving train. Another was a on foot chase in slums of Brazil(Which the movie was filmed and is beautiful.) where Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel go one on one in one of the one one action scenes you'll see with out CGI. Finally there's the climax which I won't say anything about but will blow you away.

Also there is a scene after the main credits that will imply what the inevitable next movie will be about.

Overall this is the best of the franchise with great visuals and action and a above average story and decent acting.",jmcginn174,6/16/11,2011
143,6,A better option than many others in this genre.... EXTREMELY MILD spoilers,"Better than the A-Team. Better than the Expendables. Better than xXx, Pitch Black, Battle L.A., and better than any film I can remember that stars either a UFC guy, or a WWE/WWF guy.

That isn't saying much, BUT this most recent ""Fast and the Furious"" installment is loads of fun. Extremely predictable, extremely formulaic, but this film has great non-stop action, and while it's unbelievable, it's not as unbelievable as flying a tank through the air, or flying a bomber like a fighter jet....

The ending is a little over-the-top, but at least there's a nice little twist(albeit somewhat predictable).

Basically we have a film here that is exactly what you expect it to be - only it's so fast, so furious, and so well-done that it marginally escapes the normal verdicts.

Really cool to see Vin Deisel and The ROck together, and you can tell that these two guys are a cut above the normal castings for these types of movies. They've been in the biz long enough to deliver their lines with emotion and confidence, and hold there own in every physical aspect.

All that said; I probably won't watch it again. I wish I would have seen this on the big-screen though. It really is the definition of a big-budget(huge) popcorn-flick done right, but that also means that it's predictable, over-the-top, unbelievable, and not really my cup-of-tea...

You should know where you stand going in, so if you decide to give this one a try, I know you'll like it.

Best in the series.

64/100

You'll like it if you liked: Fast and the Furious, Independence Day, Armegeddon, The Rundown, or Drive Angry.",witster18,10/12/11,2011
144,1,did NOT like this film,"I'm sorry but I can't agree with everyone here. This movie is the biggest disappointment I have had at the movies so far this year.

I would've left well before the end but I was warned to keep watching after the credits as there is a huge twist........... well what a supremely stupid twist that was!!! To me the appeal of this series was getting to see fast cars, fast women and the main protagonists doing cool stuff.

But now all we are getting is waaaay too much storyline, and guys doing ridiculous stuff.

I mean come on! how did Dom get out of those chains? The stunt of pulling that safe with the two cars was ludicrous to say the least, and we are supposed to believe that in a 10 second window they managed to get it to stop in order to pull a switch with an empty safe..... an empty safe mind you that still behaved as the full one had! We are also to believe that 'stop at nothing' Officer Dwayne actually joined forces with them for a while, and then after the bad guys were dead gave our heroes a 24 hour head start before recommencing the chase? And speaking of the Rock........ he just looks ridiculous, he appears to have two rolls of invisible carpet under his arms the whole time...... and all those muscles did him no good anyway as he got his ass kicked. Not that you could tell what was going on due to the poorly shot fight scene.

I understand suspension of disbelief and that a film like this is not supposed to win any Oscars so you should disengage your brain before watching, but IMHO this film was insulting crap that should never have been made, and as i said earlier, the twist at the end just capped it all off!!! They should have stopped at 3",mitchell7015,4/29/11,2011
145,8,mindless but sure to please,"Diesel, Walker, and Brewster are on the run from the law and hightail it to Rio de Janeiro where they recruit some old friends to pull off one final job before they go their separate ways. But the group's daring plan quickly goes awry, they receive some unexpected family news, and they suddenly find themselves targeted by bloodhound federal agent Johnson‚Äîwho never met a mark he couldn't collar. Preposterous plotting and cardboard villains abound, but made watchable by high-octane action scenes, effective casting, beautiful women, gratuitous fight scenes, great scenery, and everything else needed to pass for escapist entertainment. Overlong and incoherent, but fast enough, furious enough, and fun enough to satisfy the target audience. **¬Ω",Special-K88,4/29/11,2011
147,8,Fast Money,"I only seen the first Fast and the Furious and I own it on DVD. I skipped out on the sequels, mostly because of the bad word of mouth. When Fast Five was released, I didn't have intentions on seeing it until I learned that The Rock was in it. However, I wasn't sure if the film would deliver. After some positive word of mouth from several people, I was convinced on seeing it. So on a cold, rainy day and an awful week that had passed me by, I decided to give this movie a spin.And boy was I surprised!Fast Five is one exhilarating movie! It didn't start out well. Without seeing the previous installments, and barely remembering the first, I was a little lost in the beginning. Where things picked up was in the train robbery scene where Vin Diesel and Paul Walker (who's best performance is in Running Scared) are having that fight scene. It was pretty awesome, up until the end but I guess that's where the suspension of disbelief comes into play.The movie doesn't linger onto any dramatic scenes for too long. The filmmakers know that their target audience came for the fast cars and action. Who cares about any subplots and talking? The Rock makes a grand entrance and is provided with enough screen time to make The Rock fans happy. I also like the turn of events with his character near the end. It was handled brilliantly.Speaking of the end, the climax is probably one of the best climaxes I've seen in a very long time. I think it probably nailed the whole summer movie feel. By the end of the movie, I felt that this is what summer movies are meant to be. I don't know if the director Justin Lin saved the franchise, as I don't even know if the franchise was in trouble in the first place. However, this movie might have introduced more fans. With the series being stagnant for so long, I can honestly say that I'll be looking forward to the sixth installment.",Fields201,5/15/11,2011
149,8,Vin Diesel does The Italian Job,"This is the best film in the series, probably because it borrowed heavily from the recent version of The Italian Job. It borrowed ideas such as deciding to use a fast, nimble car to navigate through a narrow parking garage, creating a copy of the target location in which to practice, obtaining the same safe they will need to crack later, and using street cameras to direct cars through traffic. All of these elements were used in The Italian Job. Oddly enough, rumors had it that a sequel to The Italian Job was going to be made and be set in Brazil but it was never made. Was this supposed to be that sequel? Probably not. A sequel would've had new ideas and this one just had a rehash of old ones.Anyway, despite similarities to The Italian Job, this film was entertaining and enjoyable to watch.",jcallows,10/10/11,2011
151,9,Fast 5 is the BEST hands down,"I LOVED this movie!!! The action scenes are exhilarating too a whole new level.Everyone was great in this one no weak links to be found which also made it a great movie going experience.some standouts;Tyrese Gibson from the urban drama classic ""Baby Boy"", really played his character..he was hilarious in every scene he had!!! The Rock(Dwayne Johnson) was Excellent Luke Hobbs who was bad ass in his role and looked to be enjoying be apart of the cast..the pivotal scene where he is down and looks to be out help and unexpected is on the way in such a epic guns blazing scene that was so damn good! I almost gave this movie a 10 because seriously it is that good of a movie and by and I don't give movies 10 these days .Go see this!!! its worth it and u wont never regret it!!! Best Movie Of The Summer!!! A",cedicedi,5/27/11,2011
154,6,Was it really all worth for that final car chase,"If You've seen the trailer, this review won't spoil anything: There is a car chase in the end, but if you feel it kinda drags on I will tell why I felt that.In an usual police chase the policemen needs to catch on first and then there is constant pressure from their side to knock you out. But in Fast Five I felt that after first destroyed vehicle the cops needed to spend another 5 seconds to even hit the runners. After that police car gets destroyed, another 10 seconds till they are near: Not constant danger of doing a wrong turn and being busted.In contrast to what they give us in trailers: Few seconds for police to arrive and then constant mayhem. Tho a lot of car crashes is quite expensive only for one minute, you need to put some effort to make it a five minutes worth car chase.",Kristupas-vazix,5/20/11,2011
155,1,The Real Rio,"As you should know before you read more I only rate movies 1 or 10. So pass on this one, there are many other films like this that things blow up there is a silly plot twist at the end like two safes yes it was silly and it could not save a pathetic film. All the cops in Brazil are less corrupt then the ones in the good old USA. What are you crazy? I saw fast five and the steroid actors from USA were way better than all the crooked Brazilins with Spanish accents so thick that I, I had a flash back thing all the Nazis have British ascents but the British fought the Nazis and the Americans only came in at the end of the war after all the money was gone in selling to the Nazis. Well the dumbest thing about the film is the Cars try out driving a Caraochi in Rio you may as well speak Paulistia Portuguse. The film is a waste of film and so full of bull that it can only continue to reinforce a stereotype that is apparent as I ain't no uncle Tom but .................",petropolisy,6/5/11,2011
156,8,A return to what made the fast and furious great,Fast five {or the fast and furious 5} The fast five was a breath of fresh air for a otherwise stale series. I found the film to be both exciting and well written. The returning characters did not seem to be forced into the storyline they flowed nicely. I was really skeptical going into watching this film. After a few missed guided attempts at the series but For me it had rawness of fast and furious movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed the first film as well as newcomers to it. As a fan of these movies I hope in the future other installments of the fast and furious series has the same heart as this one.,twbfilm89,10/16/11,2011
157,7,Not bad but could be much better - does not fit the Fast and the Furious franchise,"Seriously? Better than the first one?? You must be crazy..... If I wanted to watch that much action in a movie I would watch Faster..... or Rambo... or Rocky. But this ain't Faster neither Rambo neither Rocky - it's Fast and Furious. I don't see nitrous oxide upgraded cars with any exotic paint or vinyl and neither installed neon lights on them nor hot chicks and high bets round and around them... The lack of races and the fantastically-action scenes made me give it a low 8. In this part of the series the staff overdid with the action and didn't put on the racing idea enough. It looks like Faster(where Dwayne Johnson stars too) with some fantasy. There are some unreal things in this movie like when Dom and Brian stole the safe and bound it to their cars through a rope. I don't know how but both the rope and the safe didn't break after crashing many police cars and even the moment when they totally destroyed the bank building. I do wonder how didn't the rope tear. The directors didn't miss the racing stuff also because they also put a race in this movie but they didn't put enough so they deviated of the title ""Fast and Furious"". And the end of the movie was so surprising..... Just like a magic but I can't explain it exactly. Overall the movie was good but I missed the adrenaline of the illegal races, the nice-made cars and the race tracks. I liked the first 2 movies in the series more than this one. I'm looking forward to seeing F&F 6 where Dwayne Johnson will participate again. I hope the directors bring back the old standard of the series and I'm also looking forward to seeing Toretto going in Tokyo along with Han and I wanna see Toretto racing again Shawn(Lucas Black). Professionally I find the movie amazingly created. The special effects, the acting and the performance are amazing. But as it is a part of my favourite franchise I give it eight because it does not contain enough of the racing stuff as it is supposed to be as being a Fast and Furious movie.

Plot - mild, proper for an action, fairly not predictable; 8/10.

Acting - the actors were just perfect as always; Also loved to see Han, Ludicrous, Roman and The Rock together as being an addition to the movie; 10/10.

Writing - fairly good but could be better; 7/10.

Performance - Very well done; Special effects were brilliant; Car chases were very straining; Action scenes were immaculate; The lack of racing and the excessiveness of unreal things are a not small weakness in the performance itself. 8/10",Achylles,8/22/11,2011
158,8,Amazing: a 5th movie beating the other 4 by miles,"OK I have never been a fan of F and F series. First one was a good surprise, fresh and at some point original, 2nd one was really bad maybe cause vin diesel was not participating in that one but in the end it sucked, I never saw tokio drift and the last one was a mix of bad acting, bad plot barely decent action and some CGI effects that looked very fake. But OMG this one has it all, from beginning to end is great entertainment, nothing more nothing less. Its like having together the best parts of the franchise with a touch of oceans eleven and some action scenes that are simply jaw dropping. This is how all the past movies should have been and being this a 5th part that is quit an achievement maybe it is an exaggeration but for me this is the masterpiece of all the 5th parts. Definitely worth the price of the ticket and I cant wait to see it in blu ray and replay a few times the last half hour of the movie.",mooviefan-891-879574,5/11/11,2011

164,9,Kick ass,"This is one franchise that I wait every time to give some thing really special. And no doubt they have given some thing special. As always there is no dearth for the action sequences but I should say there are much less action sequences when compared to the previous ones. For sure those that are there are just awesome. Through out its fully energy packed and I don't have to mention about the adrenaline rush that the franchise gives. Personally I was sad that they cut a scene on street racing. A car for a car thing. How I wish they made an action packed adrenaline pumping stuff out of that. But as such as I said there is absolutely no dearth for action and adrenaline rush. Elsa Pataky(Elena Neves), Sung Kang(Han Lue) and Gal Gadot(Gisele Harabo) have done a good job out of their roles. Gal Gadot's scene on getting a finger print from the ruthless drug lord was really funny. It would be incomplete if I don't mention about Dwayne Johnson(Luke Hobbs). Amazing stuff from him as usual. Really enjoyed the fight between Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson. Must watch stuff. Although I found the vault dragging sequence to be not too logical I would say all in all its a must watch movie. I know I am a huge fan of this franchise but I tell you, you would enjoy seeing the movie even if you are not a die hard fan of it.Thumbs up!",srknthk,5/11/11,2011
165,6,How about realism?,"OK I wont bitch around here, even though I am not really into unrealistic movies this ain't the reason I didn't like it that much. You could probably imagine that they are in the matrix and well this is why they are able to survive every car crash, every jump from a 1000 foot and can dodge every each one of the 10.000000 bullet which are fired at them. But what really bothered me was the lack of creativity (hah, that rhymed), that makes us all fortunetellers. In this movie nothing unsuspected happens which you would probably expect from a movie like this. However the action was actually great. So for all you adrenaline junkies out there Fast Five is waiting' for you!",KissMyAss31193,11/10/11,2011
166,1,what a complete rip off,"This was so terrible I couldn't get through the first scene jumping into a canyon landing in water over 100 mph. Appears the FnF scene is still making terrible movies and stealing our money. Entertaining the real real racing crowd has lost its luster. It was funny the first couple times, but now we face palm at FnF. They want to grow up and play in real action movies but they are all taken. No problem we'll make our own. I can't believe they duped everyone again, but you have to admire their ability to do it 5 times in a row now. Horrible copycat movie of several titles and yes they somehow drug the rock into it too noooooo not after such a great film ""Faster"" even he was duped into the FnF equation style movie making money machine. Please save yourselves from this Hollywood nightmare series. Let it die now. What a waste. ""are you ready for another disappointment?""",jody-justice,5/18/11,2011
167,8,"The stunts are pretty good, but the screenplay is not at all","How it possible that everything they needed would have just appeared or at hand right away? The cars, the weapons, the exact model of the super safe, the money, or even the beers they drank? The screenplay writers have no respect of the viewers least I.Q. and treated us like morons who only played and believed the scenarios of video games, the plots, the weaponry, the killings, the thefts and so on, everything just showed up whenever or wherever you wanted or needed. There were so many flaws in this poorly crafted screenplay, the plot was so ridiculous that you have to put your basic reasoning ability aside or into deep coma to allow those absolutely impossible handy stuff appeared on the screen one after another, and don't forget their playground was in Brazil? Get an exact model of the super safe right away? Need a fast car, go get it from a street race. Need several police cars to fool the police underground garage security camera? Go get from the police carpool yard. Need a warehouse to hide? No problem, you got it right away. Want to get into the police security system? That's easy, man, just clogging their toilets and without hiring by the police to call their plumbing service, you just walked in to fix it? Showing up, claiming you were FBI and left a box with a remote-control toy car for the Brazilian police to bring it into the safe/storage room without even checking? There were so many stupid conveniently-ready stuff in this brain-dead movie, but still, nothing could turn off the superior handling of the exciting street firefights and the car&safe chase and run-away scenes of this movie, and it was indeed fantastic!",rightwingisevil,4/28/11,2011
168,6,"""And why can't we drag a safe through downtown Rio behind our cars?""","Despite looking and sounding like a hung-over gorilla, Vin Diesel is actually among the smarter action stars around. He launched his own career, writing, directing and producing ""Multi-Facial"" (the movie that impressed Spielberg enough to write a role for Diesel in Saving Pvt. Ryan). He's produced 3 of his biggest hits and cannily passed on appearing in shitty sequels to the XXX and Fast and Furious franchises. He even passed on Hit-man! Yes, look let's just forget about Babylon AD for a minute, I'm trying to make a case for the guy here.

When Diesel returned to F&F in the 4th movie, he did so as producer, and brought back the mojo the franchise had lost. Fast Five builds on that mojo, and is much better than its predecessor, largely because of the clever casting decision to bring back charismatic actors from previous installments and Ocean's Eleven-ify the movie. The ensemble cast takes some of the pressure off Diesel and helps us ignore Paul Walker. If you've seen 2Fast 2Furious, you'll agree that Walker isn't exactly the beating heart of the franchise. And despite Diesel's star status, his Dom Toretto (little more than a crook-with-a-heart-of-gold stereotype) cannot shoulder the weight of the entire series alone.

So we see Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Gal Gadot and Sung Kang reprising their roles from the various sequels (if you haven't seen them, you're not missing much character background - what you see here is pretty much all you get, with these guys), with Elsa Pataky and the Rock thrown in for added sex appeal.

I could tell you about the plot, but really, do you care? Let's get to the important stuff. The Dodge Charger returns. Dom and O'Connor boost a bunch of cars off a moving train, blow it up, then drive one of them off a cliff in a spectacular set piece. There is the obligatory nighttime car race through city streets between the four male leads (Walker still nursing his bruised ego from an earlier loss in the 4th movie). And there's a ridiculous but somehow thrilling car chase finale, where the team pulls off a daring heist against every law of physics and logic (giving new meaning to the term ""drag racing"").

Continuing its self-improvement efforts, the movie diversifies the action offerings of the franchise with a car ambush (reminiscent of Clear and Present Danger), a pulse-pounding gun fight and rooftop chase through Rio's favelas (a new favourite setting for Hollywood action vehicles) and some mano-a-mano wrestling between the two bald repositories of testosterone that headline the cast.

I should warn you, the Rock is almost laughably bad in this movie. He lumbers around in a T shirt he appears to have borrowed from his infant son, barks orders at his long suffering team, shoots strangers indiscriminately and generally appears miserable. You would too, if your last movie had been 'Faster'. We know that he's a Federal Agent (because uh, he said so) and has sworn to take Diesel down, presumably because he resents that 'The Pacifier' trumped 'The Tooth Fairy' at the box office. The much touted shiny headed face-off between these two, when it comes, is actually a bit of a let down - the Rock seems worn out by the sheer amount of time he's spent chasing Diesel around Rio .

It's all good fun, and there's never a dull moment, not even when Walker is blathering about the responsibilities of fatherhood. Diesel steps in and adds a strangely credible presence to this, and the other slower, talky scenes, sensing this is where the movie really needs the clout (such as it is) of his masculine persona. He then steps back to let the good lookin', fast talking' cast do its work elsewhere.

And the girls? Israeli actress Gal Gadot is done with her national service and looks even hotter than she did in the last F&F movie (or in Date Night). She flaunts her languid curves in a negligible bikini, making a strong case for peace in the Middle East. Elsa Pataky pouts and does the best she can in her sexy cop outfit, which is less suited for law enforcement than for a Halloween sorority party. Her attempt to one-up Gadot in the curve flaunting department is foiled when Diesel rudely interrupts her just as she's taking off her tank top. Diesel reminds her (as he did Gadot in the last movie) that he's still pining for Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), then leaves. But Letty is dead! Isn't she? All I'll say is, stay until after the credits. It features a cameo by another curvy character from a previous installment. And introduces a cliffhanger that suggests exciting revelations in a future installment.

170,7,Too many characters and too little action?,"For those of us who watched all of the Fast and the Furious series, simply the thought of having most of the main characters from the past editions in one movie is a valid reason to pay. The result is just what we expect of a Fast and Furious: stunts, rides and babes. The atmosphere of Rio is a refreshing alternative to American centered filming. However, ultimately, the film goes over the top. By telling the story through the view of the (not that) good guys, the bad guys, and, also, a third perspective, that of a team of elite FBI agents led by ""The Rock"", time worthy of boiling oil and pumping adrenaline is lost. Instead, we get more of the sit-at-home work-out-plan kind of scenes that are often unnecessary. Nevertheless, a true fan of cars and action will find Fast Five very enjoyable.",mauro-batte,5/14/11,2011
171,8,The BEST of the franchise!,"The franchise resurrects. The cast matures. The crew grows up. And, The Rock joins the gang. The derailed series is finally back on track since the original with upgrades in all the departments of film-making. if you think this is a movie with races, you're wrong. Taking a different route this time, the film makers have transformed the street racing franchise into the heist action film which isn't a bad thing, this transformation has worked wonders for the movie & the franchise. Fast Five is the genuine summer blockbuster of the year, without a doubt. Its the kind of big action, big Ka-pow movie that the audience doesn't want to get bogged down in the details on if they just want to have fun. The situations these guys go through is unbelievable, we know that the way these characters drive they should all have died in the first Fast and Furious, but we know this is just a fun and entertaining franchise and we try to make peace with the screenplay as best we can because it is just fun to see these guys go at it. It's fun to see them drive cars off a running train, or speed by busy streets without crashing into each other while at the same time avoiding all sorts of bullets and explosions. Fast Five might be the most unbelievable and improbable film of the franchise, but it is still the best one. While this movie doesn't have much straight up street racing its got plenty of everything else. This is the one sequel where they got the action right on all aspects. Not much CGI at all unless it was so good you couldn't tell. Vin Diesel & Paul Walker continue to be effective in their respective parts. Jordana Brewster is fair. Tyrese Gibson is first-rate and brings in a host of laughs in the goings-on. Ludicrous is good. Matt Schulze, Sung Kang & Gal Gadot are passable. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson is absolutely superb in a strong supporting role. He imposes as a formidable rival. Here Johnson's straight arrow persona leverages the story's ultimate conflict. Showcasing Director Justin Lin's signature accelerated precision, Vin Diesel's Dom races beside the speeding train as Paul Walker's Brian leaps into Dom's sports car. Their car immediately sways over a steep chasm into the river below. Diesel and Walker leap in midair out of the car, and plunge into the water. ""Fast Five"" is just great fun. Writer Chris Morgan's story is better than the last ""Fast and Furious"", which isn't saying much. Then again we don't see ""Fast Five"" for the narrative nuances. Non-stop action reigns supreme. Lin has a crisp vibrant visual style, and acumen for insane action. Lin has two cars racing through the streets of Rio dragging a bank vault unleashing mass destruction. Granted this is over the top, and completely original. ""Fast Five"" has stunning Rio de Janeiro locals, gorgeous women, fast cars, and Vin Diesel squaring off against ""The Rock"" Dwayne Johnson. Lin has methodically checked off all the boxes. The Taiwanese director is getting really good with his craft. Car chase is obviously the top draw. Just as you wonder what else he can give you that you haven't seen before, he comes up with things that take you to yet another level of mindless pleasure. The movie doesn't linger onto any dramatic scenes for too long. The filmmakers know that their target audience came for the fast cars and action. Who cares about any subplots and talking? The Rock makes a grand entrance and is provided with enough screen time to make The Rock fans happy. I also like the turn of events with his character near the end. It was handled brilliantly. Fast Five delivers what it promises and even more. There are a lot of action sequences and they are shot extremely well. The cars move really fast, but that isn't all Fast Five has going for it. The addition of The Rock to the story sets up an interesting fight scene between him and Dominic(which is one of my all time favorite fight sequence). The Rock helped boost the series even more and brought something fresh to the franchise. There is also the plus that the film took place in Rio de Janeiro and the scenery there is just so beautiful. There is a great chase scene that takes place over the roofs of the houses, reminiscent of the Bourne Ultimatum scene in Morocco. Yes, the story is improbable, but we still are allowed to have fun with it. Cinematography is perfect. The soundtrack is also great.""Fast Five"" is not going to win any awards. It is just great fun. I look forward to the next sequel.I rate it 7.5 out of 10.",prateak09,5/18/11,2011
174,7,Fast Five,"Frankly speaking, I was unforeseen that this adrenal-driven car-chasing franchise had have such a longevity during this decade since THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS in 2001 (neither am I an automobile zealot). Now here arrives the fifth installment, which surprisingly has unequivocally became the best of the series (quite rare when it comes terms with sequels). One ground rule is that the team behind knows exactly what their audience's hearts want and exaggerates it to a breathtaking effect, e.g. several vintage-model cars (which I am sheerly ignorant of), brawny men bare fist combat (Vin and Dwayne, which makes Paul Walker looks more wooden and sulky), a mission-impossible scheme, a tint of romantics and sexy appeal using its hottie female cast (Gal Gadot, again, the former Miss Israel), and the most essential one, a prolonged vehicle-chase with its eye-popping collateral damage, which is the ace in the hole!Setting against a Rio de Janeiro backdrop, the second time this year after the successful animation RIO among Hollywood A-list blockbusters, director Justin Lin (who was also behind the wheels of the 3rd and 4th film) shrewdly maneuvers an OCEAN ELEVEN mode heist plot to bolster the intensive impulsion of the rapid tempo. Plus the visual effect is high-end enough to coerce me to neglect the implausibility of certain details. My eyes are satisfied while my brain cannot find anything to whine about at all once (during the afterthought, there are plenty of bugs there though), so one sure thing is that FAST FIVE has set a new beacon for the Hollywood mega-budgeted action films, it is a fierce competition which principally hinges on script writers' imagination, I also invent the punchline for the production company: we can make anything look real on screen, as long as there is a mind can reach it!",lasttimeisaw,9/15/11,2011
175,8,Not an average F&F movie,"The trailer gave me an adrenalin rush and my curiosity was more peaked comparing to the previous movies. But if you think this is a movie with races, you're wrong.This is a heist movie. But that isn't a bad thing, on the contrary! This franchise could use a fresh start and the big difference was that they toned down showing off fast cars and beautiful women, Fast Five is more character driven and brings back a lot of characters from previous movies, included a nice surprise at the end.My guess is we're probably gonna see more familiar faces in part 6, but we will have to wait for that. We also got new faces, in the form of Dwayne Johnson. It's a nice addition to see how he's determined to arrest the main characters and that the main characters are deep in trouble with several parties hunting them.Also different is that there isn't a single race in this one, but it has a lot of action and even subtle humor we haven't seen in the previous installments.Action fans, just go see it when you can!",lekkerinmevel,5/15/11,2011
177,2,Fast Five - or is it ?,"I never had any anticipations from this movie but watching it was a pure and utter disgust; I never thought that a director could go this far on pure Super bull Sh*t; the actions are totally out of the world and when I say out of the world I really mean it, this movie was made by disregarding every law of physics, the director must have hated physics or his physics teacher must have done some wrongs with him.

Also the director lacks common sense:

Vin Diesel vs Rocks : The probability of happening of the unbelievable is null {}

In brief:

Production value: None, Actions: Suited for star war movies, Story: Crazy and with lapses, Acting: Horrible Disgust: Guaranteed,...

187,7,Ranks up right up there with the first one!,"Wow although being a huge 'mark' for Dwayne Johnson when he portrays The Rock in the WWE i have to say his movies as of late have been nothing less then sucky. Well that all changed tonight due his newest flick Fast Five. Dwayne definitely has stick this action genre and he will be OK in my book. He's cool he's muscular and has all the bows and ribbons of a bonified action star. Pair him up with the likes of Vin Diesel another actor who needs to stick to the action genre and you have what is a little over 2hrs of sheer packed fun. Although not being overly impressed with parts 2-4 this one ranks right up with the original only lacking in car races. Now i said car races not chases and this flick is filled with em. Most of the original regular cast (minus the ones who have been killed off in previous chapters) show up for this instalment and a few from the other sequels such as Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pierce (2fast2 furious) and Tej played by Ludicrous another 2 fast memory of sequels gone past. After reuniting with Vince (played once again by Matt Schulze) who is now living in Rio with his love interest and his child. Its not long before the old team are back at it this time putting their heads together to pull off a which leads to be a 'Ocean's 11' worthy heist of the big political villain who pretty much runs Rio Dejeinero, Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). Dwayne Johnson, like i said rounds off the cast playing the lead Marshall who has been hired to hunt down and arrest Dominic and his crew. Any fan of this series should really be happy with this latest instalment that really hasn't lost any of its staying power yet in my opinion in fact to the contrary its gained life. I could see them doing more of these.",thekyles99,4/29/11,2011

Once again, as in all the recent Hollywood action movies, the sequences in this movie fail to arouse the required amount of thrills and end up to be nothing but senseless and absolutely implausible......specially the last scene ( the vault being dragged across the city by the two cars )...

The utterly preposterous fight sequences are complemented by an equally weak story line and direction....

I have avoided watching fast five for months because I thought it would be the same as the other sequels. I WAS WRONG! Fast five is one of the best, it has some of the best characters from the first four, Vin diesel reprises his fantastically cool character, and they also brought back my favourite person from Tokyo drift,Sung Kang AKA Han Lue. The Rock (who I ordinarily am not a fan of) gets introduced as a Kick ass cop.... Suffice to say its more action packed and less about cars than any of the others, I think they may of broke a record for least car races in the series :D I would now quite happily watch a sixth instalment of the series, fast five left me feeling happy and content in the knowledge that I had not just wasted 2 hours of my life.",vandangle2006,8/27/11,2011
190,7,"good, but not the best...","The expectation is always great when is a film in the franchise F&F. All previous films were great, could not be different with ""Fast 5"". Yeah, it has many unrealistic scenes, but what makes this movie good are these exaggerated as the final scenes, where Brian and Don hold a multi-ton safe in their cars. The performances were great, as always, and the soundtrack is another great thing in the film. One of the few things I dislike in the plot was this not to be the last film in the franchise. Had a great end. But instead, we find something else to make a new movie. A good idea with the return of a character lost, but that could have been discarded. With a few races, forget it if expected a movie full of speed as 2 Fast 2 Furious. But for fans, it's a good chance to see three movie stars in action in a single movie.",petailss,11/12/11,2011

If you are not a fan of the franchise, Fast Five will reel you in. There just ain't another movie like it out there. You've got Vin, Dwayne, Walker and sweet nice, Jordana. Plus a few old faces who are ready to pump up the NOS and race it till it breaks.

I was pleasantly surprised, despite the corny one liners ""this mission just went from mission impossible to mission in-freaking-sanity"" and over the top action scenes Fast Five is a delight. Firstly there is the cast, the acting is not all that bad, The Rock hits the spot as a tough cop and Vin Diesel is also good as the main protagonist. The action sequences are also great, I loved the first action sequence which drew comparisons with Bond films. The very last action scene where Vin Diesel and Paul Walker tow a safe through Rio is nicely choreographed and an incredible joy to watch. The fight scenes while there are not many are also intense and exciting especially the fight between the Rock and Vin Diesel. Fast Five being a typical action movie manages to deliver something to the viewer that excites them and gives them that sense of relief, it's not a must watch but is worth the money.",benjaminapp,4/26/11,2011

It's a total paint-by-numbers Fast and Furious, but with everything cranked up to a ridiculous level (and a lot of the flab trimmed away). If the opening scene does not make you realise that using your brain is a drawback, you shouldn't watch Fast Five. But if you can switch off, it's a lot of fun (especially the totally unrealistic final action sequence). It's the action move that just keeps on giving.

I managed to catch this film on a flight back from the states and it honestly made the flight go insanely fast. the film admittedly has some flaws and a OK story line but that is more than made up for with the rest of the film. and the final scene with the dodge chargers although a little unrealistic was no less one of the most awesome in history (no more on that or the film will be ruined). i can not say how impressed i was with this film after all the failures of its predecessorsROLL ON FAST 6!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1",jazzwoolf,8/15/11,2011

205,8,The Fast and the Furious has morphed into quite the little action series,"Before we get started, I want to get something off of my chest. For a long time, the Fast and the Furious franchise has been a big guilty pleasure of mine. Sure, they're silly, unrealistic, and way over the top, but they're fun, and exciting. Not ever cinematic experience has to mirror The English Patient. Sometimes I just want to see car chases, and sht blowing up. This series, despite it's many flaws, manages to provide the audience with enough eye candy and carnage to solidify it's spot in pop culture history. When the trailer premiered, and revealed to me that I would be seeing a host of returning characters, coupled with Dwayne Johnson versus Vin Diesel. I was on board instantly. I even learned that The Liberal Dead's own Ted Brown had a soft spot for the series as well. When I finally sat down to consume the new installment, my expectations were off the charts.Following the example that the previous film set, Fast Five is more of a crime/action flick, than another rice-a-roni car porn. Many people were not fans of the previous film, but I admired it for the direction that it took the franchise. It may sound silly, especially considering the material, but it almost felt like the franchise had matured. Whereas previous sequels tried to re-capture the flavor of the first film, focusing almost entirely on the cars, and the races, ""Fast and Furious"" revisited the original characters, and showed us what the events of their first romp has done to their lives. There's almost something magical and mysterious about the ending of the first film. It certainly romanticizes the fact that Brian let Dominic go, rather than bringing him to justice. But what are the consequences for everyone involved? These are the questions that were answered in the last film, and now expanded upon in series' return.Fast Five begins where the previous film concluded. Brian, now rogue from the FBI has rounded up a furious carpool to bust Dominic out of police custody. Living on the run in Rio, Brian and Mia reconnect with Vince, and try to pull off a heist to help get their heads above water. When Dominic shows up with the crime already in progress, he senses a double-cross, and alters the plan preventing the crew from meeting up with the man that hired them for the job. The man turns out to be the #1 kingpin in all of Rio, and he orchestrates a wide-net search party, including his own henchmen, as well as the majority of the local police, who happen to be on his payroll. Since several US federal agents where found dead in the aftermath of the robbery, a US Special Forces team is sent to apprehend Brian and Dominic, who they think are responsible for the deaths. Leading the team is Special Agent Hobbs, played by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson.The introduction of Hobbs as a character, pits two completely larger than life action heroes against one another. This not only appeals to the sensibilities of action fans across the globe, but it leads to one of the most exciting scenes of hand to hand combat in recent history. Dwayne and Vin have a terrific amount of on-screen chemistry, and could very easily go on to make movies outside of the F&F universe, both versus, as well as on the same side. Say what you want about either man, but both of them have several solid films under their belt. Hopefully the decision to put these two titans in the same film yields the obvious intended result, and Fast Five will end up dominating the box office.Enough characters return from the previous films to appeal to franchise fans, but the story and the situation generates crossover appeal as well. Even though it's a continuing story arch, anyone looking for a popcorn action flick can walk into the theater and walk out satisfied, even if you're completely unfamiliar with the four previous films.The Fast and the Furious has morphed into quite the little action series, and despite the satisfying amount of closure the film leaves you with, it also leaves just enough open so that a plethora of sequels are not only able to be produced and make sense in the context of this film, but have the potential to actually be enjoyable films. Fast and Furious has become the Saw of the action genre. The only difference being, I actually hope they make a couple more F&F films, especially after the scene that occurs after the end credits. I can't wait to see where they're going to take it from here.",Strawberry_Typhoon,5/1/11,2011
208,7,Vroom vroom... strap yourself in for a fast-paced ride...,"Having seen the previous four movies in the series, I can't really claim to be a fan, yet here I am again, sitting down to watch another of these movies. Now, I am not a fan of fast cars, street racing, nor of Vin Diesel, but there is just something about this 5th installment of the series that works so well.

Of all the movies so far, this part is the one with the most interesting and solid storyline. Sure, it was pretty far out there at times, but in overall, it did work quite well. The movie has lots of action, fast paced scenes and racing, impressive cars, and a load of really good shots of Rio.

From the very beginning of the movie, you are in for a thrill-ride, and it doesn't stop until the movie is over and the credits start scrolling. You will be riveted in your chair by this movie, that much is certain. What I liked was that the heist was more a focal point of the movie, as compared to the fancy cars.

The chase scene on foot through the narrow, winding streets, alleys and rooftops of Rio was mind-blowing. That was, for me at least, perhaps the most action packed scene of the movie. It was just so intense. It was like you were there yourself.

And the scene where they had the vault dragging after them, well it was a bit too much, a tad over the top, but it was still nice though. Yet, how very, very odd that it was only police casualties and no civilian casualties in this scene. That was just not cool. Hadn't seen something like that in a movie before, so it was impressive to see, and it looked awesome. But I think once a vault that size would get into motion and swing about, the cars would be pulled with it, and not be able to steer it around and maneuver it like they were doing. But hey, this is a movie after all.

The acting in the movie was good, despite me not being a fan of Vin Diesel, then he did do it well enough. As did the other people on the cast list. It was cool to see Dwayne Johnson in this movie, though I didn't really buy into it when his character joined up with the criminals. That was just too unreal.

If they manage to keep up this level of intensity and action in the 6th part, scheduled for 2013, then we will certainly be in for one impressive ride.

For a non-particular fan of the ""Fast and Furious"" series, this 5th installment impressed me quite a lot.",paul_haakonsen,8/22/11,2011
209,1,Utter waste of time,"This movie sucked from start to finish, actually i fell asleep watching it the first time. So had to watch it again, well from the part i fell asleep. No Spoilers only so much, the acting is total rubbish, clich√© like and painting the the average American stereotype totally over the top. F&F 3 was rubbish already, badly cut, totally incoherent lousy acting and so on... Vin Diesel i do expect more of you!!! Dreadful piece of movie Junk, the production team must have gone to town on the movie rating here on IMDb 7.8 yeah right, you gotta be a) a total numb nut American finding this trash good or b) from the production team to give this garbage more than 1.

210,8,Vintage and Clunker,"Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson): ""Alright, listen up. The men we're after are professional runners. We find them; we take them as a team and we bring them back. And above all else, we never ever let them get into cars.""Fast Five is all about cars as it was with the similarly-named Fast and Furious and The Fast and The Furious--muscle cars and muscled men pulling stunts like this improbable heist in Rio. The car chases are fun to watch, but the dialogue and acting are strictly clunkers.It's amusing to watch the film's beefiest heroes, Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson, go face to face and mano a mano for a few minutes, and the helicopter shots of Rio make an interesting travelogue, notwithstanding some time is spent in the grim favelas.But it's not even close to the cool of Danny Ocean's capers. The heist, involving a drug lord and a very safe safe, is a rehash of existing B movie capers with the racially-mixed characters coming from around the world to pull off the impossible . Brainless it is, with brawn aplenty and a few spectacular car scenes such as at the beginning when vintage cars are removed from a speeding train. If you like the chases, high testosterone fights, and hot babes: ENJOY!",JohnDeSando,4/29/11,2011
216,8,"Arguably the best in the ""Fast and Furious"" series so far.","Firstly, this movie has proved yet again that the fast and furious series is incomplete without the ever so powerful appearance of Vin Diesel. It was a treat to watch two raging bulls Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson in a single movie, can't say who looked dominating because both have such awesome physiques. Paul Walker in the role of Brian'O'Conner was as always up to the mark though his chemistry with Jordana Brewster was not so good this time. There was also no apparent reason to cast Tego Calderon and Don Omar as they did not make the movie better at all. Although I was glad to witness the return of Sung Kang and the stunningly gorgeous Gal Gadot both of whom did utmost justice with their roles. Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous also did a good job and Rio, Brazil, the location in which the story is set gave tremendous opportunities for great action and car chase sequences with which the Director did a great job, the cinematography was too good and the background score was also nice. The two main advantages this movie had over its predecessors were:1) The presence of Vin Diesel with Dwayne Johnson and the impact it had on the audience.2) Totally awe-striking action sequences, they getting so much better with every sequel, both visually as well as conceptually.Overall, a great experience irrespective of whether you are a fan or not.Now waiting eagerly to hear news about the next part!!!",shreckk,5/11/11,2011
218,8,The 'Citizen Kane' of Street Racing Heist Reunion Flicks,"Fast Five

Before I lose any of my movie critic street cred (assuming I even have any), I'd like to point out that I'm not actually placing the fifth Fast & Furious movie among the ranks of great cinema pieces of history. I'm not even suggesting that it will be the go to reference for pretentious people of the future to over hype when they want to sound like they know far more than they do about movies. I am simply stating that amongst its peers, it is a stand out piece of work.

The fifth installment of the Fast & Furious series takes up right where the fourth left off, with the car savvy and fan favorite criminal mastermind Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) on a prison bus on his way to the big house, with his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) and her beau, former F.B.I. agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) fast on their way to busting him out. This shouldn't be a spoiler for anyone who has seen the trailers and noticed how much Vin Diesel isn't in prison, but they succeed in freeing Dom.

The trio soon find themselves in trouble with the wrong bad guys after a botched heist, which subsequently ends up getting them framed for criminal activities that put them in the sites of U.S. DSS Special Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) and his team of basically government backed bounty hunters. Dom and Brian come up with a plan to get revenge on the bad guys, and make a little cash on the side, but in order for it to work they are gonna need a little help. From pretty much everyone they've ever met.

This is where the reunion aspect of Fast Five emerges. The fourth film in the series (Fast & Furious) touched on a fun idea of reuniting the cast from the original film, which hadn't been together since then, and adding a few new faces along the way. This installment ups the ante (and the fun) by bringing back most of the important characters from all three of the original films, including Roman and Tej (Tyrese Gibson and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges) from 2 Fast, 2 Furious, Han (Sung Kang) from Tokyo Drift, and several other familiar faces along the way. Getting the original band back together in four was fun. But getting the whole band back together in five really takes things up a notch.

And therein lies the considerable fun and charm of Fast Five. This is not grand cinema, even as far as action movies go. No ground is broken, the plot is weak, the schemes are too elaborate, and the physics are mind boggling at best. But we are five movies deep in this franchise now. If you are looking for thought provoking action dramas or Bourne style visceral hand to hand choreography, you should already know you are in the wrong place. Fast Five promises little more than the fun of watching hot girls and muscle men driving fast and beating the tar out of one another. And it delivers that in spades. It even throws in some big guns and explosions for good measure. Movies should be judged primarily on how well they can hold up to the promise of what they try to be. Fast Five is supposed to be loud, fun, in your face escapism. Something with a lot of familiar faces, some good laughs, and a lot of pulse pounding action. It is all of that and probably a little more. If you do not like Fast & Furious movies anyway, then you probably take your movies too seriously, or at least don't know how to separate when you should take them seriously and when you shouldn't. Either way, you are definitely buying the wrong ticket. However, if you are a Fast & Furious franchise fan, or simply like a little mindless fun, you are in for a great ride. This one is the best of the bunch.",jleonard31,4/29/11,2011
219,7,decent.,"Fast Five. Action packed thrill ride gun firing explosion blowing WOW of a film. You would think that after all the other four films that five would be pushing the sequel's too far. now i can see that, However ""Fast Five"" is by far the best one out of all of them. i guess because they have put much more money into this film, the budget was an estimated $125,000,000, the film was well advertised and people were more aware of this film coming to the cinema and there was a big ""hype"" about it coming out. I think the hype towards this film was the audience responding to all the characters from the previous films are now featured together as one ""big family"" and working together as a team to do this last job. This films got it all, comedy action thrill suspense, muscle and guns and girls in next to nothing washing beautiful cars, i mean seriously can anything top that? watch and see, yet another must see film and will rock your night at the cinema.",j-cahill-974-388388,12/11/11,2011
220,1,Really terrible movie,"What an awful movie. I cannot believe that this film went through a screening process and made it to release in this form.

This is clearly just a vehicle to cash in on the F&F name. Nobody looks like they really believe in the movie, its almost written on their faces ""I am just doing this for the money""!!

Its about as cheesy and unbelievable a movie that you will see this year, and probably next year, unless they do a F&F6. The one liners that they thought worked in the earlier movies are hear, long moody faces to camera are supposed to replace the storyline. Special effects are one thing but nearly everything in this movie is just laughably unbelievable, more like a cartoon. I am still reeling from the shock of this horror of a film. What a waste of money.

The sad thing is I like the Rock, I like Vin, but this movie is really a sad showcase for their talents. I hope they never sit and watch it!!!",timesinthesun,8/24/11,2011
223,7,Better than expected,"I went into this movie not having seen any of the previous ones, and was pleasantly surprised to find a fairly good action movie. Lots of beautiful exotic sports cars and video game-like stunts using them to make crazy jumps and turns and chases. The shootout scenes weren't half bad either, with people realistically going down after being shot once instead of the usual routine in most action movies where everyone seems to be wearing heavy duty bullet-repellent suits on and it appears to be impossible to hit anyone despite hails of bullets in the air. Though some scenes admittedly do get rather ridiculous, with speeding cars skidding around a heavily populated city and yet everyone seems to get out of the way in time, but oh well. You have to give a certain amount of leeway to a movie like this to enjoy it. Vin Diesel and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson both turn in their standard tough guy performances, and I don't think fans of either one of them would be disappointed.For a pre-summer season action movie, it could have been a lot worse, and is a fun and light diversion.",quinnox-1,5/17/11,2011
227,6,"Expectations low, check. Disappointment, well, no.","I've seen all the others so I was expecting nothing more and possibly less. I was not disappointed. Action, action and more action, YES! Acting, direction, story, ehh. Who cares: they destroyed more cars in 60 seconds than I ever thought possible. The Rock was in top physical condition compared to a flabby and fast aging Vin Diesel. The brawl was so darkly shot that I suppose they could have been naked mud wrestling and nobody would have been the wiser.Overall, fast and fun. Do not expect ANYONE to win ANY awards for ANYTHING that happened here; just let it flow over you. BTW, are foley artists retarded? Beer in a bottle being tipped back for a drink does not sound like a half-filled bottle of water being inverted. And, not every motion has to have some artificial sound effect attached to it. Much more satisfying is the slight sucking sound as the bottle leaves the lips and a mild belch following. Pullleeez.Ciao, babies.",dariansdad,12/1/11,2011
230,1,Why would anyone want to watch this,"It is the same thing as all of the Fast Furious films, completely against gravity and reality, for all you people who thought it was a good film watch crossroads, for you young people who don't know any better watch Ronin. The characters still think they are the bees knees for driving fast, any idiot can drive fast going in a straight line, the train stunt I think the character brian would have been safer just to jump and roll on the ground rather than drive a car an jump into a cannon, its things like these scenes that get very stupid people killed. The scene with the safe and the two cars going down main street of Rio, come on how the hell could it happen, watch top gear with Jermey Clarkson drive a evo towing a camper van as fast as they can, engine pistons come flying through the engine head and the camper van is on wheels not dragged. Everything with this film is wrong and is completely stupid. I was ashamed with IMDb and the users reviews. Probably the only good thing about the film is the two new actors who play the Brazilian brothers with there constant bickering. Please stop making these films or else try and make them somewhat believable. PS don't go to the cinema to see this!",Eoinloughlin4,4/25/11,2011
234,9,5th times the charm! Best Fast and Furious film yet!,"When I saw all of the Fast and Furious films, I thought ""that's it, there's no way this franchise can get any better!"" All of the films are so stale that it's not that enjoyable and it's not a ""full-adrenaline thrill ride"" anymore. But this film, they went over the top but it works...

The first thing why this film is really good is the return of the characters from past films. A lot of familiar faces like Ludicrous, Tyrese Gibson and Matt Schulze. Gibson was funny as hell, his humour made everyone laugh and his hilarious quotes are just epic. I just loved the idea that they're all back together like a family.

Second, the hatred relationship between Dom and Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson)was one of the things I like about the film. Once they both saw each other during the chase scene, everyone in the audience was like ""OHHHH!"" you can tell that the feud between them was gonna be amazing. Dwayne Johnson portrayed Hobbs very well. It's like he wasn't given any script and the director told him, ""JUST BE A BAD-ASS"" that's how good he was! I was disappointed that the fight scene was a bit short but it was very aggressive and destructive. I would like to see Hobbs again in the next sequel.

Third, the elements of car chase scenes are changed in this film. There are some scenes that involves racing (like the police car race and the police vault scene) but they don't show most of the racing and mainly focused on the job which is to rob the richest man in Rio. I think it worked very well. The explosive and destructive scenes are just insane! The train scene was just crazy and the bridge scene with just total mayhem! I thought these scenes would never happen and looks too crazy but it was very entertaining, it just kept me on the edge of my seat.

*MASSIVE SPOILER. DON'T READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT* I was about to leave the cinema during the credits but when I saw this surprising post credit scene, I just thought I could give you an advice...

ALWAYS STAY TILL THE END OF THE FILM BECAUSE YOU'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN NEXT!

Eva Mendes (as Monica Fuentes in 2 Fast 2 Furious) appears as a cameo and she reveals to Hobbs that Letty (Dom's girlfriend) is alive. I WAS LIKE HOLY S***! It definitely made me want to watch the next sequel. I'd like to see what Dom will do after he's with Elena and of course the ""feud"" between Dom and Hobbs.

Overall, There are definitely lots of improvements from previous films and it was an ""entertaining, humorous action packed"" film and I recommend this film to anyone because this could be one of the biggest films of the year. MUST WATCH!

BEST FILM OF THE FRANCHISE 9/10",emo_boi1012,4/24/11,2011
240,1,A lack of care for the Brazilian audience...,"Terrible movie.

It's true that it had some nice action scenes, specially the last chase scene. But the plot was weak. A lack of care for the Brazilian audience.

Some of the facts of the past of Brazil were not accurate. How about that train scene? Was it supposed to happen in Brazil? We DON'T have deserts or that kind of train here!!

Further, most of the actors who were supposed to be Brazilians were either Americans or Hispanics. They had a really weird Portuguese accent. Sometimes, we Portuguese speakers needed subtitles to understand what they were saying.

Although the Portuguese of Jordana Brewster is perfect, non-Portuguese speakers won't notice the differences. As well as those who know nothing about Brazil.

Not trying to do a spoiler post here, so I won't go in to them. Its the kind of big action, big Ka-pow movie that the audience doesn't want to get bogged down in the details on if they just want to have fun.

Don't sweat the details and its a good movie to romp around with.",rcnaylor,5/16/11,2011
249,7,"Dom, Brian, and Company Are Back!","Great action and really a great ride. That goes back and forth. Along with also with the Rock as he is a great ""antagonist"" for the company of Dom, Brian, among others. As we see Brian and his girlfriend, Dom's sister breaking out Dom while he was going to do hard time two years ago in ""Fast & Furious."" Brian an ex-FBI agent, now finds himself on the other side of the law. As they head to Rio De Janeiro. In order to escape prosecution for obstruction and aiding and abetting Dom. While his girlfriend Mia and Dom's sister has a secret for Brian. That Brian and Dom are in a shock. But you have to see the movie for the secret I am not given away. But not before there is a huge payday of $100M that brings back people like Tyrese Gibson from the other Furious movies. In order to accomplish this goal. But federal agent Luke Hobbs, played by Dwayne the Rock Johnson. Is in the way as he and his gang seek to apprehend the gang. While Hobbs is a bit of a you know what at times. He means well and that he is is like the Tommy Lee Jones character of ""The Fugitive."" Relentless and no-nonsense. The cop that is accompany Hobbs, played by Spanish actress Elsa Pataky is also had a past with Dom. As you will find out why. Great action and non-stop from top to bottom. But also it had witty lines and a great story. As hopefully there will be a sixth installment.

It just doesn't do it for me.. It's just wrong.. If you they need to use that much crap in it for it to get ratings well it mustn't be that good.. I thought it was awful!!!I can't wait to see a movie where they have guys walking around in G Strings the whole time.. Zooming up on their privates.. You almost never see that..

253,7,The best of the Five,"¬®I suggest you make peace with whatever demons you have left cause come tomorrow, I will find you.¬® The Fast and the Furious franchise is back with its fifth installment, Fast Five, and I must say this is probably the best one of the series. Almost all the characters from the previous films are back and director Justin Lin has managed to bring the franchise back to life. I thought Tokyo Drift would definitely bury the series without Vin Diesel or Paul Walker, but then they managed to bring all the main characters back, mix them together, and now it seems we will have plenty more fast cars coming our way. The screenplay was written by Chris Morgan, who also wrote the third and fourth ones, and the story works really well although that isn't the reason why we go see these movies. There are probably better actors, better scripts, and more believable heist thrillers than this one, but we still go see these movies for the cars and the great action sequences. The situations these guys go through is unbelievable, we know that the way these characters drive they should all have died in the first Fast and Furious, but we know this is just a fun and entertaining franchise and we try to make peace with the screenplay as best we can because it is just fun to see these guys go at it. It's fun to see them drive cars off a running train, or speed by busy streets without crashing into each other while at the same time avoiding all sorts of bullets and explosions. Fast Five might be the most unbelievable and improbable film of the franchise, but it is still the best one.The film picks up right where the fourth one left us, Brian (Paul Walker) and Mia (Jordana Brewster) are breaking Dominic (Vin Diesel) out of custody while he is being transported to jail. They successfully manage to free him, and all three of them become fugitives. They are forced to continually be on the run and end up in Rio de Janeiro with very little money left on them. In Rio they stay with Dom's longtime friend from the first film, Vince (Matt Schulze), who is now living in the favelas with his girlfriend and baby boy Nico. Vince tells Brian he has a job for them and since they are short on cash they have to accept. Unfortunately something goes wrong in the job and the guys make a new enemy: Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), a corrupt businessman who owns the entire police force and gangsters in Rio. Now Dom and Brian have all the gangsters, the Brazilian police, and special Federal Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ¬®The Rock¬® Johnson) along with his elite team after them in beautiful Rio. Dom and Brian decide to pull off one last job in order to teach Hernan a lesson, but in order to do so they will need to assemble an elite team. That is where the rest of the crew from previous films come in. First we have Tej (Ludicrous) and Roman (Tyrese Gibson) from the first sequel, then there's Han Lue (Sung Jang) from the Tokyo Drift film, and finally Gisele (Gal Gadot), Tego (Tego Calderon), and Rico Santos (Don Omar) are back from the latest installment. Together they hope to pull off one of the biggest heists of their lives worth 100 million dollars, but being able to pull it off doesn't seem that easy.Fast Five delivers what it promises and even more. There are a lot of action sequences and they are shot extremely well. The cars move really fast, but that isn't all Fast Five has going for it. The addition of The Rock to the story sets up an interesting fight scene between him and Dominic. The Rock helped boost the series even more and brought something fresh to the franchise. There is also the plus that the film took place in Rio de Janeiro and the scenery there is just so beautiful. There is a great chase scene that takes place over the roofs of the favelas, reminiscent of the Bourne Ultimatum scene in Morocco. Yes, the story is improbable, but we still are allowed to have fun with it. I didn't get into the movie that much until the second half of the film, but let me say that the second part really delivers. This movie also has the best ending and it really leaves you expecting the sixth part, which I really didn't feel that excited about in the other films. Fans of the franchise will surely be satisfied and Fast Five might even add a few new converts along the way because it is the best one so far. The soundtrack is also great and Don Omar really is hilarious in this movie. He delivered most of the funny scenes in the film. Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson also did their part in sharing the workload. It was just good seeing all these characters together and the cameo in the ending is just the cherry on the pie. I was surprisingly entertained with Fast Five.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",estebangonzalez10,5/17/11,2011

What i liked the most in ""Fast Five"" that action sequences doesn't use CGI, or uses it where it's only necessary. Stunts are ""crazy"" in ""Fast Five"" - in a god way.

It defies the laws of logic, storytelling, and physics at every turn and it just goes on and on and on. And so predictable--especially if you've seen Oceans 11.I almost walked out during the ""climactic"" final chase. Such a snoozefest.The dialogue and stunts are laughable--and the mayhem and destruction in the last 30 minutes are numbing and unbearable. You keep looking, asking ""Where are all the bodies? There must be hundreds or thousands of people killed during this chase."" But nope, you don't see any bodies because there aren't any. No people on the streets of Rio during broad daylight even though in every previous shot the streets were jammed with pedestrians. My god this film was boring. It's the first film I've seen in Imax and it'll probably be the last-- seems pretty clear that's just a marketing scam to get people to see movies that would otherwise tank. I'm sure you'll ignore my review and see it anyway. That's cool, but bring a good book.",vsdobbs,5/13/11,2011
261,6,Decent...but,"I don't know all the backstory of this franchise, but I enjoyed this movie for the most part. It was action-packed and visually enticing. I am not a guy, but if I was, I think I'd know this movie is tailor-made for me: filled with bravado and a cameraman who apparently can't take his lens of the eye candy and cheesy little one-liners parsed throughout here and there. This is a film tailor-made for the ""Fast and Furious"" fan.But while the action and cinematography is appealing and exciting, some areas left a little bit to be desired. I thought the plot was a little weak and convoluted. I found some of the acting to need a little improvement--the cheesy one-liners didn't help. Most of all though, the cheesy romantic components were just sad. If Diesel and the cop had one more long stare at each other, I might have hurled right there in the theater. And the way all the relationships came together at the end and pretty much everyone got their fantastical happy ending was just a bit much and over-the-top clich√©. I was actually surprised at how clich√© it all was. The over-the-top happy endings left me wondering where this franchise will go from here, if there is a plan for its continuation at all. There are no holes left. How will the next installment come in with all the characters rich and free and in love and whatnot? Hmmm But let not the previous paragraph deter you. This is a fun film worth seeing.",TamPalm,6/10/11,2011
265,6,Somewhat failed attempt at popcorn,"Picking up the story where the previous one left off this one doesn't need much explaining story wise - the gang is still up to no good and using fast cars to do it. This time the scenery has changed to Southern America, Brazil to be exact.The theme of the films being fast cars, fast driving and action sequences galore this one does not fail to deliver. There's plenty of all of that. When it comes to adding something new to the series it does fail a bit though - it's just more of the same. Add to that the fact that most of the story is more than a little ludicrous and the end result is easily derived: if one is able to dislodge ones brain for the duration of the film then it can be enjoyed otherwise it can't.For me the turning point was the point where it became clear there were no characters to bond with. Every single one of them should be locked away for life. One can't care for characters like that - whether they live or die, escape or get caught, it doesn't matter. It makes the film flimsy and too easily forgotten.6 out of 10 corns not yet fully popped.",LazySod,5/18/11,2011

Besides these little quibbles, I have never seen a movie where they used so little actual real natives. They only used Rio as a backdrop and huge set, clearing the streets almost completely for all the scenes. But now that I think about it, that was the way all of the movies have been made.

However despite the fact this film hasn't been released yet and I've not actually seen it but I work for the studio I am pleased to say the series hasn't redeemed itself. Fast 5 pulls out no stops this time around. It almost delivers on action, cars, poor quality acting and a hackneyed storyline. It doesn't bother exploring the character personalities, not showing humour, fear, vulnerability and determination this time around which gives the movie no strength or depth also missing from previous Fast n Furious movies. I found myself cringing out loud a few times at the unsubtle humour, and leaning forward for the action scenes which should've been truly amazing.The Story is predictable and will not keep the surprises coming to the end. The Cast has not matured and it shows in the lack of quality of acting over previous F'n'F movies. Ironically, one of the production companies involved is called Original Productions.Pros:Average pace throughout the movieAverage storyline and plotAverage Cast of actors/ actresses Unimaginative and un-inventive elements throughoutOne or two ""Wow"" momentsCons: Would be nice to have more screen time for the carsa 130 cheesy moments ( but this adds to the humour of the film)Overall: Highly recommended if you have low expectations, nothing better to do and a free cinema ticket, or your a complete drone with no imagination who likes retarded films with spoon fed plots. Just be sure to fast forward until the end of the credits!0.5/10",StudioLAX,4/25/11,2011
273,9,Re-ignites the F&F Series!,"This film had a lot of hype to live up to. With intense action sequences and the revival of Toretto and Mia supporting O'Connor in the last film, there could be no let-up of delivering an exciting yet somehow different Fast and Furious film this time around.They tried, and succeeded.They've tied in little bits of what made the other films good, all into one epic 2 hour long movie. While the plot itself is nothing original, we all know to expect this from this from a car film. But it has to be said the film is full of action, from drifting to gun fights, car, train and foot chases, confrontations, and of course, racing.The film starts right off from where we left from the last film, so we get to see how Dom is freed. Furthermore, many characters from all previous 4 movies return for the big heist, but they are given a good amount of time on screen each, which is important.And finally, we have The Rock himself making his debut into the franchise.We also learn a bit more about Dom, and the relationship Brian has with Mia and Vince (yes, Vince!). This is wrapped up with simple, witty dialogue between the gang and a few surprises in the story (not to mention a huge twist at the end mid-way through the credits. It has to be said, some stunts are pushed a little too far, but it does makes for some genuine terrific action.The only gripe I have is that it would have been nice to see more tuners but muscle car lovers won't be disappointed.A very well done to the makers of the film for bringing this one back to the roots of The Fast and The Furious while keeping the action tense and the storyline fresh.",lewisray2,4/23/11,2011
275,5,Best in series,"Fast Five is a very good action movie with pretty much all of the characters that have appeared in the series returning for one last mission. I won't give away any piece of the story because I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen this movie and wants to read the reviews before seeing the movie. What I will say is this: the action was great, the special effects were great, and the cars were great. The actors gave solid performances. The dialogue was a bit cheesy at times but come on, the only reason we come to see these action movies is for the action. Unlike the rest of the movies in the series, Fast Five is more of a heist movie than a street racing movie which is a nice change in the series and it really shows that the series has really matured from the first movie. My only complaint is that the some of the beginning parts were a bit slow. But that one problem didn't really take away the fact that fast five is a great way to kick off the summer. I would recommend it to fans of the series and to people who are fans of action movies in general. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.",JaredGilman,5/7/11,2011
278,8,Best Of The Series?,"Fast and Furious 5/Fast Five is, believe it or not, arguably the best in the series. Despite the often awful dialogue occasionally rubbish acting and non existent plot, it easily contains the best action and has the most exciting scenes of the series. The Film also contains a scene where Vin Diesel has an incredible fight with Dwayne Johnson,that alone is worth the price of admission. It also brings back some familiar faces from the previous films including, Han, Tej, Vince and Roman Pierce, played by Tyrese Gibson who has some of the best/worst dialogue in the film, but is just as funny as he was in ""2 fast 2 furious"". If you didn't enjoy the previous films in the series then stay well away from ""Fast Five"", but if you have enjoyed them, then buckle your seat belt your in for the best ride of the series to date.

Girl: ""I'm Pregnant""....Boy: ""You're Kidding me!?"".... or ""This Mission just went from Mission Impossible, to Mission Insanity""....yes that's the kind of completely brain-dead dialog that's commonplace in this holy-hell-crud-fest. This is a movie whose story and dialog has the sophistication of a Grand-Theft-Audio Video Game. It features ludicrous action sequences, terrible direction, and equally bad acting and line deliveries. There are lots of good looking people on screen with stilted cue-card-bad line-delivery take your pick of any actor involved. Before even starting this stink-fest you knew who the target audience was for by the PG-13 rating. To top off, the music is lifted from old Miami Vice episodes. Not worth your time.

291,9,When The Rock and Vin Diesel throw down,"When Friday The 13th hit part 5, everyone had one word in mind-pathetic. When Saw hit part 5, only their most loyal fans stayed around. By the time Star Wars: The Phantom Menace (part 5 of the series) came out, everyone was booing. Now, you may ask yourself, what's the point of this little rant? Well, the point is that it's hard to keep a movie going with 4, or hell, even 3 sequels (just look at Scream 4.) That being said, Fast Five is the best in the series. Vin Diese, returns as Dominic, who escaped from jail and is sentenced at the beginning to more jail time. He promptly escapes and teams together a group of cons, thieves, and most importantly, car drivers for one last mission. Also returning are brother and sister Brian and Mia (Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster). All the veterans are really good, and Ludicrous is very funny as Tej, a newcomer who helps the guys out on their last mission, but the scene stealer here is Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as Luke Hobbs, a cop who always gets his man. He's simultaneously funny and intense, and when him and Diesel throw down, everyone in the theater will be cheering. Fast Five is an exciting mix of action, comedy, and even a bit of drama. See Fast Five on the biggest, loudest, screen possible. It's the start of the summer movie season, and it's looking pretty solid.",Jackpollins,5/17/11,2011
292,10,fast five is a great movie that you should definitely watch,"fast five is my all time favorite movie. it had great fighting and racing scenes. everything was perfect. your dumb not to like it. Vin diesel is a great actor for the movie. he's daring and always prepared. as usual, fast five had a great beginning and a great ending. it seemed like a suicide mission but they made anything possible at the end. the seen with the train was very exciting. you always wanted to know what was going to happen. The movie changed a lot to surprise you, which made it very suspenseful. they invested a lot of money into this movie with all the destroyed cars. it made it totally worth it. it is a great movie compared to the other fast and furious movies. it makes you want want to see the next sequel because it always keeps you guessing at the end. thats why i'm positive fast and furious six will be just as good or even better",dxjycz99,8/30/11,2011
293,9,the best fast and furious movie so far,"This was the best Fast and Furious movie I have ever seen. The action-packed scenery was out of this world. It was pretty clever of Dom and his gang to slip past those cops. I think that street race that Dom and his racing buddies would go 1/4 mile for $1,000,000 while driving police cars. That scene when Dom and Brian were driving while having a safe attached to the back of their cars was so funny.It was awesome to bring all the previous cast members from the Fast and the Furious, 2 Fast 2 Furious, and Fast and Furious and ban them together to take on Hobbs, Dwayne Johnson, who was the bad boy to take Dom and the rest of the racers down.Dwayne Johnson played an excellent job being the Head Cop. His character, Hobbs is someone no one wants to fool around with.As for Vince, I thought he was gonna betray Dom by bringing him in to the cops. He seemed like he couldn't be trusted.Vin Diesel and Paul Walker make a perfect partnership for these movies that will literally DRIVE YOU WILD.For the special effects, they were incredible for my ears. I love listening to the sounds of explosions, gun shots and car crashes.The only scene I find ironic was when Dom saved Hobbs' life so he (Hobbs) joined forces with Dom's gang. Vin Diesel vs Dwayne Johnson was a bloodbath match. I hope this movie wins a few Oscars. It was stupendous.",tfbowler314,9/4/11,2011
294,8,"Not only did it suppress the surrounding hype, it kicked, punched, shot and killed the hype.","I couldn't help but to applaud and cheer after the ending credits among with the rest of the over crowded people in the theatre. It exceeded my every expectation and being a hardcore fan of the fast and furious franchise I couldn't have asked for more from the 5th instalment. It has everything from bone crunching action, combat, shoot em up scenes and of coarse what's fast and furious without the cool dream cars.The gang are finally back together but for this time it's for one last job. The cast is recruited from a range of all the previous fast and furious movies.(1-4) Which was great to see all the characters back together kicking ass. Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) was impressive and my word he gave Vin diesel a tough competition (in the movie as well as their physique!) To be honest I had thought that fast 5 was just going to be a sappy Hollywood attempt just to bring the cash in, well I'll tell you this, the director, the cast and the rest of the crew have smashed the box office and deserve every penny of it. A perfect action/adventure flick for a night out whether your a fast and furious fan or not.After the phenomenal first instalment (the fast and the furious) A mediocre second instalment (2fast and 2furious) A inconvenient, mildly entertaining third instalment (Tokyo Drift) and a decent mildly thrilling fourth instalment (fast and furious) they bring back all the thrills, action, adventure and fun in fast and furious 5 (probably the best one out of the series so far)The 12a (PG-13) rating however did seem a bit dodgy. This film included far to much violence enough for it to easily be a 15 (this would allowed the film to bring slightly more adult themes and violence into the flick too)Don't get it twisted, this film is all Heist and not street racing but when it is as entertaining as this who cares? Thank god they avoided the ""3D era"" which in my opinion would just ruin the film due to the strange camera angles they do purposely to make it feel like it's in front of you. On that note the camera angles were actually really great and noticeable, especially when they show the spectacular RIO. (setting) Fast and furious fans will not be disappointed, especially because it has one of the most bad ass cast ever. The twist was a O.M.G moment so I strongly suggest you wait for after the credits to see this (those of you who have seen it will understand!)Overall I'm completely satisfied with this movie, it's pulled the fast and furious franchise out of the dirt and back into the fun, action-packed adventure that we all love. Take a bow the Fast and Furious crew you killed the hype and by far made the best movie this year so far. Don't miss out on such a exciting adventure and feel how ""fast and furious"" this film really is.",k-dhesi,4/28/11,2011
295,5,Why is this so popular?,"How would i describe Fast Five? Preposterous! Ridiculous! Absurd! The film is riddled with one-liners and stunts that would kill the average human(except for Chuck Norris, but is he really human), yet it is entertaining for a summer popcorn film. i have seen all of the series, except for The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift and this one seems to be the worst of all. It is like they said lets take all the good parts of all the previous films and through it together. Unfortunately it does not work. This film was about them stealing cars, but they don't show many cars in the film and they hint at races, but skip to the next scene, so we don't actually see the races. We meet some characters, but only for as minute and then they almost disappear for the rest of the film. As i stated above, it is still entertaining, but... Just check your brain at the door.",oceansroar,8/27/11,2011
296,8,"Packed wall-to-wall with breathtaking action sequences, this fifth entry is easily the most thrilling and the best of the 'Fast and Furious' franchise","Unless you're ""Harry Potter"", franchises rarely have much gas left in their tank by their fourth instalment, let alone their fifth. But two years ago, the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise defied its slow but sure decline by reuniting the original stars of the first movie that made it such a runaway success ten years ago, thus finding its groove once again and speeding away with the best box-office results the series has enjoyed.To prove their success then wasn't just a fluke, the stars- Vin Diesel and Paul Walker- are back at it again with a fifth-quel, and you know what- it's even faster, even more furious than anything the franchise has done. Yes, dear fans of fast cars, hot babes and most of all brawny men, ""Fast Five"" takes the hallmarks of the franchise and brings it to a whole new level. It's the best ""Fast and Furious"" movie by far, an adrenaline shot of pure guilt pleasure that promises and delivers white-knuckle thrills and edge-of-your-seat excitement.Certainly that's the expectation thanks to an exhilarating opening sequence where our favourite recalcitrant criminal Dominic Toretto and his newly-minted criminal associate Ryan O'Connor are off stealing luxury race cars on board a moving train. Besides federal agents, Dom and O'Connor also have to contend with double-crosses and oh, a looming bridge. So when you have our heroes leaping out of a speeding car while plunging into a ravine, you know you better buckle up for the ride you're going to be in for.A memory jolt for those who may have forgotten- Dom was arrested at the end of the last movie, and was sentenced without parole to 25 years in federal prison. But where's the fun in having him behind bars? So en route to a maximum security prison, Dom's transport is promptly ambushed by Ryan and his girlfriend Mia (Jordana Brewster). The trio end up in Rio, where said daring midday heist occurs and lands them on the wrong side of Rio's most feared criminal kingpin Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida).True to Dom's nature, he seizes it as an opportunity to do one big score and then go off to relax. With this nifty twist, screenwriter Chris Morgan (also the writer of the previous three films) turns what used to be a movie around the confines of the underground street racing circuit into a heist movie. Morgan also does an Ocean's Eleven as Dom assembles just about every supporting character who has appeared in one of the franchise's films for his latest crew- including Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges), Han (Sung Kang) and Gisele (Gal Gadot).The chemistry between the returning cast and characters is delightful, and Morgan reserves the best zingers in his script for their banter. New additions Tego Calder√≥n and Don Omar also add to the fun, their mutual riffs on Tej that exploit the language barrier between the two Americans simply hilarious. Of course, the highlight of this movie is really the introduction of just about the most badass F.B.I. agent from up North, Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), sent into Rio to apprehend Dom and O'Connor.The relentlessness of Johnson's Hobbs is a good foil against the arrogance of Diesel's Dom, and their subsequent mano-a-mano no-holds-barred fistfight that results is brutally efficient. Indeed, watching Diesel and The Rock go up against each other is worth the price of admission itself, because there simply is no one bigger, badder and balder than Diesel. It's a duel made in action heaven, and director Justin Lin milks it for every punch, kick and body-smash it is worth.But Lin isn't content to rest on the laurels of his hulking action stars. A footchase across rooftops and down alleyways of the crowded, crime-ridden hillside favelas (neighborhoods) of Rio surpasses the sheer adrenaline that Jason Bourne induced in ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", and makes great use of its locale's backdrop. The finale, though, is quite something in itself and beats anything that Lin has done, or for that matter, anything that you have seen so far in the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise. We're not about to spoil the surprise for you here, but suffice to say that it will go down as one of the most breathtaking car chase sequences in cinematic history.And with that, ""Fast Five"" has more than about justified its existence by being a souped-up, pumped-up, revved-up action movie that floors its throttle from the get-go and doesn't let up for a full two hours. Yes, there are times when the dialogue borders on laughable, especially when Morgan tries to give his characters- Dom in particular- more depth and some semblance of character development.But this is not a movie that you watch for those things, and a franchise that was built on these things- rather ""Fast Five"" is about revving engines, crashing cars, brawny men and hot babes and on every one of these counts, it delivers spectacularly. We guarantee you by the time the end credits roll with a sneak peek of where the franchise is headed to next, you'll be cheering for the sixth ""Fast and Furious"" film.",moviexclusive,5/1/11,2011

301,10,Fantastic,"It's rare that I come out of a movie and just want to walk back in and watch it again - and how often is that likely to happen with the fourth sequel? Probably never again! The movie has so many great moments from rooftop chases to gun battles to the amazing safe chase finale and all with very little or no CG - I'm just glad there were no tunnel chases like the previous movie. The quieter moments are great too, the extended family these characters have created make their bond very believable and like a real family they fight but ultimately have each others back. There are some extremely funny moments too, the toilet scene is funnier than anything in the latest Big Mommas House and any conversation between Tej and Roman is delightful. Surprisingly The Rock is barely in the movie but he does get a great post-credits moment with someone else from the franchise history. It's worth sticking round for that. It is a far superior action movie to most others out there and definitely better than the other car movies of late, Faster and Drive Angry - I'm looking at you.",HingeThunder,4/25/11,2011
302,9,Solid Sequel,"My first review of 2011 is ""Fast Five"" and once its non stop action. After my major disappointment with the fourth installment my first thought walking into the cinema was pretty much the same reaction after walking out of the fourth movie. Sure the movies now are much focused on action instead of cars however the car scenes in this film surpass the ones from the fourth movie. Justin Lin must of taken pointers after the fourth movie to cut down on the CGI and use more real life cars and stuntman, this has paid off.

The overall result isn't perfect but its sure a hell lot better. The cars in this film mainly are American Muscle V8's with the odd Japanese import every now and then. The writing of the film is a lot better and there actually a story and character development that was missing from the fourth movie. It was great to finally have most of the characters from the all the movies into one for one big adventure.

The only cons about this movie is running time of 130 minutes, to date its the longest ""Furious"" movie in the series and should have been cut down. Another con is lack of races. Sure there where cars but not enough racing to pleasure the hardcore ""Furious"" fan. However there is a few show stoppers that will please these included the fight between Vin Diesel and The Rock, the million dollar quarter mile race which includes the four main characters in Dodge Chargers and the climax which includes a giant safe, two bad ass Chargers, a bridge and a lot of smashed police cars.

Younger viewers will be turned off this movie due to the lack of racing and the films length, I counted at least 15 young people walking out after 30 minutes into the film. The first major races doesn't happen until a hour into the film. Recommended",killbill_28,4/21/11,2011
303,8,All in all not a bad movie at all,"Well I waited until the movie actually came on DVD to view this movie. Being that I have pretty good surround sound I felt that I could get the same effect sound-wise if the action was good. Well I must say my sound system got quite the workout. I quite expected the movie to pick up exactly where it left off with part 4. Then the story moves into territory I thought it would. The only thing I can fault the movie on is predictability. You could see where the movie was going a mile away. Then when they get the ""crew"" together I figured right away that they were going for the whole (Ocean's Eleven) angle. Especially when the climatic ending comes into play. I had it quite figured out by time it was all over with. I just wished they made the so called 'villian' in this movie a little more 'villanous'. But like I said, overall though this isn't a bad movie at all. It is definitely an adrenaline rush of a movie. At first I thought the stunts would look over the top cheesy, but they were actually pretty good and packed with good intensity. The climatic chase sequence definitely looked a bit more realistic than the climatic car chase in part 4, which I was glad about. All the characters worked really well together as well, and you can tell just how much their chemistry has grown through the years. They definitely play well off one another.",Zephyr75,10/7/11,2011

315,1,"Worst of the franchise (only one minor spoiler, but i had to be mentioned)","OMG... I cant believe the high rating of this movie. You gotta be kidding me. This is by far the worst of all Fast and Furious. The script was artificial. The acting was boring. The story is so fast paced in the beginning, it doesn't look natural at all. It's just one scene glued to the other.

Also, I'm OK with some cinematic action scenes, but there are some over the top ridiculous scenes in this movie.

Not to mention the clichés. I mean, we know it's hard to avoid clichés in movies like this, but some are so old people have to stop using them, like good guys being caught by bad guys. Then bad guys leave good guys tied up with only one guy to watch them. Good guys get free and subdue that one bad guy. I MEAN, REALLY? Whoever wrote that scene must be a genius! HOW DID HE COME UP WITH THAT SH*T?

Horrible, dude. JUST HORRIBLE! It feels like they are just trying to see how far they can push the sequels. Write any crappy plot with an excuse for them to race and see if people buy it. They are buying it so far, so yeah, expect another sequel. Unfortunately...

AND Don't GET ME STARTED ON ALL THE SCENES WHERE THEY MADE RIO LOOK LIKE A CITY IN US! Our Police don't have those fancy cars. That train they took does not exist. And the worst of them... The Rock coming into the favela with 5 dudes. He stares at the bad guys int he favelas and they chicken out. ROFL! Yeah, right.

319,8,Fast Five review by Featured Flicks,"***Don't miss the bonus scene after the credits***Fast Five is a heart pounding thrill ride that easily beats the previous four movies in the quarter mile! I really enjoyed this movie and was surprised to find that many critics agree. After seeing the movie I was really happy with the storyline, as it was more complex and thought out then the previous movies.There were many other things to love about this movie besides the story. The scenery in Brazil was magnificent. Aerial shots of Rio are always beautiful, what an awesome city!There were many stars from previous films, which made the on screen reunion more dynamic and enjoyable if you've seen the other films. Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), and Han (Sung Kang) all make a reappearance and lend their expertise to grab a share of a cool $100 million.To top it off Fast Five has more action, explosions, gunfire, fist fights and car wrecks than you can imagine. This is a two-hour adrenaline ride that will exceed all of your expectations of what and action movie can be. I enjoyed Fast Five's action originality, geographic selection of Rio, and complete story.

320,3,"Fast And Furious , Lame and slow","Words can not sum up just how bored i was whilst watching this today in the cinema , it was without a doubt the worst film I've seen all year , and i love the fast and furious franchise it was so boring and dull and the plot was just lame , its supposed to be about underground street racing gangs knocking off other people for money and merchandise , instead we see a bulky bald headed guy run around with his breasts out for 2 hours saying , YOU FAMILY , YOU FAMILY , the script was just poor and you see none and i mean none of the Proper racing , just when you think your about to see a kick ass drag race the director pulls to a cocky shot of them already winning the suited up car , because these guys are just to good to loose.... -.-

If you ask me , and I'm surely doubting you will , this movie has absolutely nothing to do with cars or the fast and the furious , its about them trying to evade the law without cars! I thought that was the point of these films , to show us cool cars and cool stunts with cars , pulling a safe out of a wall in the middle of Rio and dragging it 15 miles isn't exactly what i call a decent insight to the films premise.

Here's how i define the franchise not including this film:

Nice cars , Detailed descriptions, of what make the cars good , Nice Illegal ,street races, Japanese women in skimpy skirts holding up the flags.

That's all i ask out of films like this , but instead its pulled away and and attempted to try and be more sophisticated and its failed in my opinion.

My sister enjoyed it , but she lacks braincells , and anyone else who enjoyed this film is short of a few themselves , i actually fell asleep a bit in the cinema my sister had to punch me awake because i was snoring.",richenstony,4/22/11,2011

It is blended with thrill, action, fight, and sentiment scenes. Right from the beginning to the end, you could enjoy by watching the action scenes of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker.

As well as the old street race folks join the hands with F&F 5 team to show some formal car stunt sequences. At last, in this edition Mrs. Paul Walker gets pregnant and her brother Vin Diesel got a second hand hot chick as a future loving lady. Eventually, the way this movie ends I felt the completeness work done by the Director, rare to see this fulfillment in the English movies.",gopi-wings,5/7/11,2011
323,8,The BEST Fast/Furious sequel,"While this movie doesn't have much straight up street racing its got plenty of everything else. This is the one sequel where they got the action right on all aspects. Not much CGI at all unless it was so good you couldn't tell. Crazy shootouts and an awesome fight scene. The story is probably the best out of all the sequels, while not quite that great. Its a rip off from The Italian Job, but i never liked that movie.The character development is there for our main cast from the first film. While a couple action parts are cheesy its hard not to like this movie. Much better then the last film and Dwayne Johnson made the movie better. If your a fan of the franchise go see this because they just reinvented the whole franchise.",lilicedude227,5/8/11,2011
324,2,Bad Movie,I don't know how this movie was liked by so many people!! It is probably as bad or slightly better than Fast & Furious 4. The last FF movie that I liked was Tokyo drift. Rest of them (following it) are just boring and uncreative.The movie has a plot which is borrowed from Ocean's eleven without a clear role for each of the players. The car chase scenes are unbelievable and stupid. There were hardly any decent car chase scenes. Last 2 minutes of the movie was a big product placement gig!The Only thing that was warm about the movie was the presence of inter- racial couples. Except that every thing else was as cold and unexciting as a arctic winter!,xyzthedude,5/6/11,2011

326,10,This movie is great.,"Not Inception great, not Shawshank Redemption great, but for its genre it delivers. It is extremely entertaining by being able to deliver fast action car chases, explosions, car wrecks, AWESOME fights, etc. No one can say this movie is not over the top in that aspect. The whole family theme was very well played by each character and everyone did their part. But out of the whole FnF series this IS the best.The brilliant idea to bring the entire cast back works great in this movie and it does come off as a reunion movie. I have seen them all and all the FnF wanna be movies, this one is it. Let this movie be the movie that starts your summer. Thanks to Justin Lin and everyone who worked on this movie you really delivered. I think this will be a $100 million dollar opening for you.",ashanti1922,4/30/11,2011
327,9,"""Mission Impossible"" Meets ""Ocean's Eleven"" On Hot Wheels!","As the fourth sequel in ""The Fast and the Furious"" franchise, ""Five Fast"" combines elements of a Tom Cruise ""Mission Impossible"" epic as well as the George Clooney, Brad Pitt & Matt Damon ""Ocean's Eleven"" outings. Our high-octane protagonists have fled south to Rio de Janeiro. They plan to steal a fortune in cold cash from Brazil's most dangerous man because he has framed them for murder. Swift, swerving, snappy reflex driving constitutes an integral part of this careening carefree narrative. Mind you, the larger-than-life heist and the way our heroes not only prepare but also pull it off absorbs about half of the film's brisk 130 minutes. Justin Lin and his three-time ""Fast and Furious"" collaborator scenarist Chris Morgan have raised the stakes again so they can top ""Fast & Furious"" and they've done a splendid job of topping the previous epic. When Dominic Toretto and Brian O'Conner aren't tangling with murderous Brazilian thugs, they must contend with an incorruptible good guy. Tenacious Federal agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne 'the Rock' Johnson of ""Doom"") vows to hunt them down and apprehend them and he never quits. Literally, our heroes are between a 'Rock' and a hard place! ""The Fast and the Furious"" franchise has evolved over the last decade from illegal street racing done in conjunction with some crime. Initially, the speeders hijacked eighteen-wheelers for their loads. Since ""Fast & Furious,"" they have involved themselves in bigger crimes. The life & death heist here is as outlandish as it is audacious. Indeed, ""Fast Five"" surpasses ""Fast & Furious"" for no other reason than its final 30 minutes overshadows everything before it. No, Toretto and O'Connor couldn't have gotten away with their ambitious scheme in real life any more than they could navigate those tunnels without accident in ""Fast & Furious."" Nevertheless, Lin and Morgan make their strenuous efforts look like a lot of fun, something that the tunnel racing sequences lacked.

""Fast Five"" opens where ""Fast & Furious"" ended. Dominic 'Dom' Toretto (Vin Diesel of ""xXx"") has been sentenced to 25 years in Lompoc prison. Former FBI agent Paul O'Connor (Paul Walker of ""Into the Blue"") and Dom's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster of ""Annapolis"") along with another driver wreck the prison bus in route so Dom can escape. Incredibly, nobody is hurt in the accident. The opening gambit in the previous movie ""Fast & Furious"" was so good it made the rest of it appear anti-climactic, but this isn't the case in ""Fast Five."" Indeed, Lin and Morgan top themselves in ""Fast Five."" Once O'Connor and Mia have Dom sprung, they are approached by Dom's childhood friend Vince (Matt Schulze of ""Blade 2"") about a railroad heist where they will steal some sports cars. This heist recalls the opening gambit in ""Fast & Furious."" A wrecker cruises up alongside a train. The thieves cut an oblong hole in the freight car containing the vehicles. They catapult the cars out sideways onto the wrecker's ramp and then lower the ramp so the drivers can back down off it and peel away in a cloud of dust. Of course, nothing can go smoothly in a heist movie. Our heroes discover the DEA has impounded the cars and their native gun-toting accomplices refuse to let the DEA thwart them. The Brazilian gunmen kill the DEA agents without a qualm, while our heroes are incriminated for the killings. Dom helps O'Connor get off the train, but Dom has to plummet his convertible into a river. They jump for their lives.

The Feds dispatch Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson of ""Faster"") to capture Toretto and O'Connor. Meanwhile, Dom concocts an incredible plan to take over a $100-million from the man whose killers gunned down the DEA agents. In South America, crooked entrepreneur Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almedia of ""Desperado"") rules the country. Reyes gets whatever he demands. Our heroes find a computer chip in a confiscated Reyes' sports cars. The chip contains a treasure-trove of information about all of Reye's cash stashes. Dom urges them to pull 'one last job' and rob Reyes blind. Our protagonists assemble a racing team that includes O'Connor's childhood friend Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson of ""2 Fast 2 Furious""), Tej Parker (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges of ""2 Fast 2 Furious""), Han Lue (Sung Kang of ""Tokyo Drift""), former Israeli intelligence agent Gisele Harabo (Gal Gadot of ""Fast & Furious""), and a couple of others. Dom and company strike the first of Reye's safe houses. Reye's men watch in horror as our heroes burn the money. Immediately, Reye relocates his fortune to the downtown police station. He locks it up in a vault that can only be opened with his hand print. If you've seen the trailer for ""Fast Five,"" you know they steal the entire vault and then drag it like a wrecking ball through town so the finale looks like a demolition derby.

Ultimately, ""Fast Five"" is about having a good time. Again, the heroes are the underdogs, while the villains are thoroughly treacherous. The Rock shows up as a good guy caught in the crossfire. He is wants to capture our heroes because they are his quarry. Of course, the fast driving scenes thrive on adrenalin-pacing. The numerous gunfights are noisy enough with everybody blasting away at each without blinking. ""Fast Five"" reunites virtually everybody and then some who have survived all previous epics. Naturally, the Brazilian scenery is fabulous, and ""Fast Five"" serves as a travelogue when Lin and Morgan aren't wrapping expository scenes about the heist around our ears. A mindless epic about motorized mayhem, ""Fast Five"" springs some surprises that change everything that will make you yearn for a fifth sequel. Be advised, don't leave the theater until the entire end credits roll, you're definitely in for a shock.",zardoz-13,5/9/11,2011
328,8,"My favorite in the franchise so far, although it almost has nothing to do with street racing","This really is my favorite in the franchise so far although it really isn't like any of the other films in this franchise in the past. In fact this one has to do with heist involving cars and has almost nothing to do with street racing at all. But that doesn't matter cause this is a entertaining movie with thrills and it's a real adrenaline rush. This really is a film for men with tough guys, suped up cars, insane action sequences, explosions, guns blazing and hot girls and etc. This movie is a definition of a entertaining popcorn flick. The plot is stupid but it's still sure fun to watch when the set pieces and action sequences are done in a very entertaining manner although very over the top. Physics don't apply in this movie at all and the crazy stuff happening on screen doesn't make any sense sometimes but that doesn't matter cause overall this is a stupid entertaining flick. Yeah it has a lot of elements guys like to see, but a lot of girls enjoyed this movie as well. The adrenaline runs out sometimes since the action and the stuff going on gets a bit tiresome after a while though. Most of the team members in the heist played the character off alright. And surprisingly The Rock(Dwayne Johnson) was pretty good in this playing the badass macho cop. This movie also has few scenes that are memorable that actually stands out, one of them is the scene where Vin Diesel and The Rock duke it out in a melee hand to hand fighting.8/10",KineticSeoul,5/2/11,2011
329,5,LOL LOL LOL really?,"I just wanted this to be quick. One of the most important scenes in the movie is a huge Fist Fight scene... Two actors BEAT EACH OTHER BADLY..Next scenes not a scratch on them, not scars, fat lips, black eyes nothing.LOLWhere did you learn to direct/produce?ARE YOU KIDDING US? Ruined the movie.. Sad Armatures at work!Very sad guys.. Constantly people falling and getting hurt yet the time line scenes after them everyone is back to looking pretty.You should fire anyone involved in this picture who decided that people cant get hurt or damaged!",chipdealer,5/5/11,2011
330,9,High Speed Thrills For The Entire Family,"WOW!!!!This is my first review but I just couldn't resist throwing a big shout out to this movie. I am a 53 year old woman and I took my 30 and 14 year old daughters and we were all on the edge of our seats for 2:10. We had already fallen guiltily in love with parts 1 and 2 on instant watch Netflix, skipped 3, and have 4 on order. This sequel had just the right amount of action mixed with better plot and definitely more character development and emotional bonding than the other entries in the franchise. All characters are brought together and the addition of the Rock just amps up the sweat and muscles. The bookend action scenes are jaw dropping and though I started the series in love with Paul Walker, Vin Diesel is now my first love. The dialog is still cheesy and there is still plenty of macho posing and women in scanty garb but it's what we expect from this series. The best part is that this movie can be watched by the entire family and that is rare these days with all the profanity, blood, and sex. I only remember maybe 5 curse words in the entire movie, and although there was a lot of gunfire the blood was kept to a minimum. We went to a 5:30 pm showing in a large theatre and it was almost sold out with a long line waiting for the next showing when we left. I looked around and noted all age groups, including families with small children. Be sure to stay after the credits!!",farmersrachel,4/30/11,2011
331,10,great movie but missed the post credits,This was an excellent movie prolly the best of the series. Although i missed the post credit scene can anyone help me out and tell me what it was from what i hear it gives the movie a big twist!! new i shouldn't of left early but everyone in my group wanted to leave so i got stuck not seeing this scene. The scenes of the movie are very action packed the only problem is that they took away from the street racing and kinda went to the oceans eleven type feel with the bank heist and getting a team together to do a heist. Bring the rock into the movie prolly gave the series a boost. In the way the movie ends before the post credit scene it seems like there ready to make a 6th installment of the series,lazyboy101991,4/29/11,2011
332,10,Fast Five stars out of 5,"Saw this movie last night and left the cinema NOT disappointed. I'm not a big fan of the FF franchise and wasn't too excited to see this one, but thankfully this was different (and got treated to free tickets). I enjoyed the story a lot, thought the acting from every character was decent and the comedy were used at the right moments.

Don't know about anyone else but the film reminded me a lot of Ocean's 11 in terms of the plot with the objective of pulling off ""one last"" job/heist. The elaborate planning to pull it off wasn't over the top, matter of fact I don't think it even went down the way they originally planned it due to unforeseen circumstances but nothing seemed ""off"" with how the film progressed.

Only gripe I have, if any, is the cliché rich villain who seemingly has the entire police force in his payroll.

A lot of viewers started walking out when the credits start rolling but I recommend you stay (ala Iron Man). No, Samuel L. Jackson/Nick Fury won't appear trying to recruit Dom into the Avengers, but it does have an interesting twist that suggest there could be a 6th film. If they execute the potential 6th installment the way they did this then I'd definitely watch it.",ronaldo-rivera03,4/27/11,2011
333,9,Action packed!!!,"wow!!! wow!! wow!!... I am so pleased with this version of the Fast and Furious franchise, this movie top out and exceed all my expectations, had me at the edge of my seat from the beginning till the end, which they showed more racing for example at the end of it, it wouldn't hurt to see that GT-R go against that sick wide body SRT-8, also please bring more imports into it, how hard is it to bring some more ideas from the original version, that's what everyone wants, car racing, car racing, oh well, I guess the action in it made me happy overall... Have to give credit to the action director or who ever was in charge of the car action scenes, it was amazing, have not see one like this since the ""Italian job"" movie... Cant wait until the next one comes out.",sanchez-joel,4/29/11,2011
334,4,The Top Twenty-Seven Things I Took From Fast Five,"1. There was enough testosterone in Fast Five for me to get married and divorced three times, due to dozens of affairsall with women.

2. To even use the phrase ""Leave Your Brain at the Door"" to describe this movie is like describing Phoenix, AZ as hot.

3. They gave The Rock a goatee so you can tell the difference between him and the other meathead.

4. The group-heist scheme was so juvenile, even Danny Ocean would call them amateurs.

5. Of course, they left it open for a sequel, which, no doubt, should be called The Fastisix.

6. Pregnant women that leap from two stories and crash through the roof of a structure should at very least get a spot on the next Planned Parenthood promotional video.

7. What comes after the following series of battles? King Kong Vs. Godzilla; Freddy Vs. Jason; Alien Vs. Predator; Pacino Vs. De Niro..uh, Dwayne Vs. Diesel?

8. Not everyone likes sequels being made. But, I'm sure as hell Paul Walker does.

9. The movie's not going to be considered for Best Picture anyways, so I hope they fired whoever made the decision to delete the scenes that the series is known for – racing cars to win other fast cars.

10. Thankfully, EBay sells everything, including an entire, full-size vault, exactly like the one you plan on robbing. Heck, in one click, you can get it delivered in hours. To Rio, no less.

11. The movie opened in April 2011 to $86 million which spun Hollywood Honcho's heads until summer began. Then their heads were just shaking.

12. Expecting Fast Five to be realistic is like believing there really are prehistoric piranhas in Lake Havasu, AZ.

13. Calling this predictable is as predictable as calling it predictable.

14. Incredibly, there wasn't a writer's strike during the production.

15. Sooothey steal four cop cars, and their first instinct is to race them in plain view?

16. Also, now that four cop cars are now missing, much to the bottomless pit of luck to our antiheroes, the police never bothered to GPS the cars, much less write a theft report.

17. Joker burned money to make a point. These guys did it because they couldn't come up with one original idea.

18. These guys have more lives than Jason Voorhees and yethave only about half as many sequels.

19. You could mute this movie and still know what's going on.

20. Cops turn bad so frequently in this series, they should turn to politics next.

21. The cartoonish finale is so ""Yeah, Right"" that it makes Wile E. Coyote's schemes plausible.

22. Why is it in heist movies, it's always their last gig? Their last take? Their last job? Their last everythinguntil the next installment?

23. What is Monica Geller doing in Rio robbing crooked police?

24. UFC called and asked Vinnie and Rockie how they can make their fights now not look so school-yard-brawl'ish.

25. When you find out you're gonna be a dad, asking the nearest tough guy his fondest memories of his own dad is like Ted Striker asking the guy next to him to pinch him to see if he was dreaming.

26. Wow...Vinnie's actually smarter than he looks. He took an additional role as Producer.

27. With everything wronghow on Earth was this just simply entertaining and probably the best of the series? (Yes, indubitably, I actually enjoyed this mindless flick.)",thesar-2,8/21/11,2011
336,10,Best movie ever!,oh my god best movie yet i hope they come out with another one thats even better then this one. the action was amazing i couldn't keep my eyes off the screen it was just that good. anyone that loves the fast and furious movies u have to see this i saw it at the midnight showing was so worth it big time. i couldn't believe that this one was better then the others. i had been waiting for 5 months for this movie to come out oh my god staying up late to see this movie was worth it big time. it had be speechless after the movie was done. it had my heart racing it was just that good and seeing it in Imax made it way better then just seeing it on the normal screen.,punky19912002,5/2/11,2011
337,10,Best movie i saw in years,"I give this film five stars. This was really the best movie it had drama(I'm not some sort of movie critics expert but i like the storyline and everything it was sad, sometimes funny) it had action , it had everything. I give great respect to all the actors, and i must say I'm not gay or something but Diesel has the charisma that when i see his movies i don't have problems to see them again. Not like some Jason Bourne stuff it's good but you don't see it more than once. The actors are the kind of guys or at least the characters the kind of guys you would like to kill a bottle of cheap vodka with.I recommend this movie to anyone and as the other guy i just registered to post review for this and i am using this service not just first weekend so you can imagine how I liked it.And i am gonna see this movie again, but this time without that popcorn.",SilentAsshole,5/12/11,2011
338,10,I was going to keep my husband company but WOW!!,"I am not a ""fast cars - cute guys"" girl at all so when my husband said he wanted to see this, I only went along to keep him company (and to twist his arm into coming to see a chick flick in the future with me!!).I really, really enjoyed ""Fast Five"". The movie was packed with action from start to finish... I had only seen the first film previous to this so there was a connection with the characters which are very likable, and by now if you have see the previous movies, very likable.I was excited to see Dwayne Johnson (the Rock) can actually ACT!!! :) I liked it so much, I am pulling the previous movie out of the shelf tonight to watch.One thing I will say is: Stay and watch ALL the credits. You do not want to miss what comes by the time the last of them roll by... We didn't know but thankfully we were just going down the steps when it happened and now we are very excited... at least half of the audience had gone and missed it!",tina-175,5/8/11,2011
339,4,Could have been so much better,"I am a big fan of action movies, and I know that when it comes to this genre, the viewer has to go in knowing that the script will be corny, the actors will most likely be sub-par, and the stunts will be partially unrealistic. I also know what's great about action movies; the camera work, the explosions, the gun fights, and the adrenaline. Unfortunately,I feel that Fast Five gives the action genre a bad name. Let me start with the script. I rolled my eyes so many times that they started to feel sore. The worst line was probably, ""This ain't mission impossible! It's mission in-freaking-sane!"" Oh dear God, that one hurt.

Secondly, the acting talents of the lead characters were significantly overshadowed by one terrible actor. That's right, you guessed it- Dwayne Johnson. He should have stuck to wrestling. He was a stiff, robotic, constantly grimacing steroid with legs. His fight scene with Dom consisted of nothing but Vin being thrown through fake walls and glass (over and over again), followed by some oddly homo erotic flexing of both actors pectoral muscles while looking into each others eyes.

The story is just as flawed as the acting. While I enjoyed the little family reunion of characters from the previous films, the plot they are involved in is filled with so many holes. I will only mention the two big ones. First of all, Dom and Brian manage to pull an industrial sized bank vault out of a building using only souped up cars. This is not only completely ridiculous, but totally impossible without more powerful engines and traction on their side. It doesn't stop there though...next they drag the vault at top speed through Rio, using it as a weapon against the cops. Later on the vault is pulled at the same velocity by only one car. Come on. They couldn't have insulted our intelligence as an audience more.

The biggest plot hole is the point where the two federal agents (Johnson and the token female agent) join up with Dom and Brian. I was so lost at this point...why would they suddenly decide that they should trust their criminal prey and work with them especially after: -The group is suspected of murdering the officers on the train. -Their racing buddies pull guns on said agents. -They drive through Rio with a vault killing not just corrupt cops, but innocent bystanders and cause a great deal of property damage. Just saying.

The worst part of the ending was seeing Dom walk across the beach with the female agent. Really? They just had to give him a love interest, didn't they? He should have ended up with The Rock. They would've been a cuter couple.",outlaw1990,5/13/11,2011
340,10,Amazing,"Simply amazinggreat action - great that the characters are united - great story - great endingaction packed and one of the best films of this decade. You really get into the the characters too (if watched all other films over and over again like me)The heist element is also very good and love the flexibility and diversity of the changing plots, unpredictable enjoyment another key feature that can not be ignored is the setting, it's great. Wonderfully scenery and adds to the plot extremely wellOverall a must see",b-s-uniteds-biggest-fan,5/3/11,2011
341,10,Let us pay homage to all the automobiles that were sacrificed in the making of this movie.,"One thing about this movie becomes immediately apparent: its fixation on the automobile. This is a movie that goes through automobiles like a glutton consumes food. The wreckage and carnage is nonstop. This movie is a junkyard dealer's dream. This movie may set a record for the most automobiles demolished in one movie. In this movie, automobiles are crashed, smashed, dismantled, reassembled, assessed, analyzed,and discussed. In this movie, automobiles are more than just props, they are characters too who are sacrificed to achieve a greater good, which is to tell a story. When an automobile blows up one can almost imagine that poor hunk of metal grimacing in its final death throes, as the humans fight on. Almost all the action centers around automobiles, flashy automobiles, as well as their cousins, the armored cars, trucks, and vans. In this movie, if an object has an engine and wheels it is vulnerable to destruction by fire, blunt force or explosion, or a combination of all three. In this movie automobiles are put through their paces. This movie shows that when an automobile traveling at an extremely high speed makes contact with some other heavy object, the results can be spectacular, and in this movie it is proved time and time again. All this being the case, this has to be one of the best action movies made in a long time. The movie brings together all the elements need to produce a credible, entertaining product. The story is innovative and original; the acting is strong; and the cinematography, including special effects, is incredible. The good guys are really good and the bad guys are really bad. Jordana Brewster is beautiful as are all the female cast, but Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson have a screen presence which carries this movie. They are an entertainment team that is unmatchable. Bringing these two superb and charismatic performers together in one movie works brilliantly. The story moves forward relentlessly, each scene crammed with action. Also, this movie contains spectacular panoramic vistas of Rio de Janeiro and the music is snappy, as is the dialog. There is quarreling, fighting, friendship, teamwork, love, loyalty, and betrayal. Dwyane Johnson is the new Arnold Schwarzenegger, except that Mr. Johnson is better. His screen presence is incredible. In addition, he can act! Congratulations to everyone involved in making this movie. It is a masterpiece. This movie is a much-watch for any action movie aficionados and for movie buffs in general consistent with the movies PG-13 rating.",PWNYCNY,5/4/11,2011
342,10,Excellent!,"I have loved the whole Fast & Furious

series ever since they were made,following

their stories as the movie series progressed.

In The Fast & The Furious: Fast Five I loved

how they showed all these cool and fast cars in a sequence when they were testing them for the cameras. I thought it was really great how they made Mia pregnant and throughout the movie

it showed Dom and Brian's relationship change a bit towards each other (in a good way) and Dom threw the race for Brian and his sister (Mia).

The graphics and visual effects were at a very high quality. Definitely my favorite out of the

series and a great movie to see:)",EmBlack23,5/1/11,2011
343,10,Everything that the first four should have been.,I went to see Fast Five the day it came out and the theater was so packed that they had to stop letting people into the movie. My first thought was. If this movie is bad then there will be a lot of angry people. NONE whatsoever. The people in the theater were so pleased with Fast Five that most stood up an gave an applause. There is a reason why this movie broke the record for movies opening in the month of April. Because it's THAT good! BOOM! Everything about this movie is better than the previous installments.1. Storyline 2. Action 3. Tension 4. Acting 5. HumorMy Fast Five for list of improvements. Fast Five was easily the best installment thus far in the series. My personal favorite movie of the year so far. Also Dwayne Johnson's performance was flawless. I guarantee this movie to everyone whether they like the Fast & Furious series or not.,invisiblecdog,5/9/11,2011
344,1,Can I have my 2 hours back?,"Definitely in the bottom 3 movies I have seen. I'm a Vin Diesel fan all the way back to Multi-Facial. I liked Pitch Black and Chronicles of Riddick along with just about everything else he's done. Even the first Fast & Furious was a good action movie. Hell, I even liked XxX! This one was pretty bad.I try to have suspension of disbelief when I watch anything but I just couldn't enjoy this movie due to all of the strange character development and plot holes. I know a lot of people really like this movie (including my brother who said it was one of the best movies he's seen -- gonna have a talk with him) but it just wasn't my cup of tea.If you like the F&F movies then you should see this one. If not, then move along and find something better to watch. When I checked IMDb for this movie prior to getting it the rating was 7.4. This is one of the rare times that IMDb's ratings have let me down.Overall the acting was horrible, the plot was bad, the action sequences were hard to follow, and the characters really weren't likable. I saw on IMDb that they're making F&F6... Why? Were there that many unanswered questions from the first 5? Make Riddick 3 or Iron Giant 2 instead!!",seanbreeden,11/23/11,2011
345,9,Fast Five is supercharged and running on NOS,"After the horrendously disappointing sequel that was 2fast 2furious, my hopes of reliving the excitement and energy of the original were dashed, quicker than Dom could push the NOS button on his pimped out charger.Tokyo Drift was refreshing, and Fast and Furious was a step in the right direction. I'm so glad then, that Fast Five has resurrected my love for outrageously overpowered cars driven by super-models speeding to hyper techno low bass music. This movie rocks.Of all the movies in the series, it is by far the most action-packed. Explosions, car chases, free-running, you name it. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, and occasionally it will throw you off it.The acting has improved, which is to be expected, since most of the actors have gained experience since the first installment. Adding The Rock as an antagonist to Vin's character was a smart move. It kept the film fresh, and built up tension between the characters.The only problem I have with this film is it's lack of focus on the cars themselves. Don't get me wrong there are enough cars in the film to fill Jay Leno's garage, but I wish they would incorporate a deeper level of interest in the cars, and not just the characters. But besides that minor issue, you will love this film, it's full of new ideas, and it even has a twist to boot, something I was not expecting.Fast Five goes back to the original formula, tweaks it a bit, and blasts it back in your face.Highly recommended9/10.",iamthematrix-1,4/30/11,2011
348,8,Great Action and Value for Money F&F Film,"Any reviewer who rates this low (thereby bringing down the IMDb rating for this film) completely misses the point of the F&F franchise and the writers' intention to bring a fun, action-packed car chase film to it's fans - not, to challenge the minds of intellectuals or get all the physics right. Let's face it, what movie DOES? It's entertainment! You're paying to be wowed and impressed - not to learn how a car crumples on slamming into the ground awkwardly at high speeds. Criticise this film for its lack of realism and you'll join the pack of nay-sayers and party-poopers in the corner! Straight up, this film is one of the best - if not THE best - of the Fast and Furious series so far. It's loaded with crazy fast paced action, which it delivers right off the bat with an explosive rescue of Dom from his prison bus. Totally crazy, but totally amazing to watch - as are all of the action sequences including dragging an over-sized object behind the cars and having it slam into everything in sight. Hilarious, maddening and absolutely awesome to watch! Hey, it's entertainment.One thing that this movie does do for fans is get all the favourite cast members back together for a great heist film. The car racing is not as prominent in this movie, as in previous versions, but it still includes some exciting races with the lead characters. Stunt driving is there in droves, and the cars - whilst not a huge range - are impressive enough to wet one's appetite.The story is solid, and the characters are well defined and the introduction of The Rock into the mix, facing him against Vin Diesel, is a waving banner for ""great fight sequence""! It's intense and reminiscent of the crazy WWE action! There's a bit of romance, a sprinkling of a thriller and suspense, a sampling of horror (softened for a well rounded audience), plenty of over the top action and the standard comedy moments (keenly enjoyed in this series). If you want a new take on the Fast and Furious series, with plenty of good times and value for money - whether you see it in a cinema, or rent it on DVD/BD - then Fast Five is certainly worth every cent!",Zelnak,9/12/11,2011
353,8,okay kinds,"Waatching the previous F&F movies !i Thought this movie dint live up to expectation. They tried to get all the old stars but many of them look quite old. And seriously dint have the tedious race sequences as it was more abut robbery....!!! Whatever it sure is good in terms of the attitude and the final sequence of chase is simply awesome. Especially, loved it when the truck right in between the road to surprise its true reason for being on roads. Sure is worth a watch. Among all the previous F&F movies, i guess the ""Tokyo Drift"" is the best of movies I have ever watched. Find it really hard for any of the movies to come close to that. I guess the next part of the movie they should pick up some of the latest model and told something about the latest car. In fact, they should bring in those Aston Martins, Bugatis, Formula-1 cars, allthose re completely missing. If you watch Transporter-series, they focused so much on the car, even F&F needs something more & abit extra X-factore :)",nameesh,5/21/11,2011
354,2,No wonder,"No wonder that the United States provoke revulsion around the world when they show racism cynical encrusted in their culture. They can even make bids to conduct ""thief who robs a thief has 100 years of forgiveness. "" The U.S. citizens can kill, subdue, take ownership of the dirty money of Narco-trafficking and also land of heroes, with the grace of our federal police. For Hollywood, a sample more sharply into the thinking of the people of the United States, everything that is not your parents is garbage, showing contempt and ignorance about the American South, particularly the Brazilians in Five Fast, premiered recently. Happily even for lovers of filth and violence, it is easy to see and draw parallels between the absurd: bandit keep money at the police station and a safe being dragged at high speed through the streets, even in Rio de Janeiro.",mau-mal955,5/8/11,2011
359,4,"Gratuitous and routine, but highly enjoyable in places","I'll start by saying i was never a big fan of the fast and the furious movies, but this is definitely the one i liked the most.The story starts off with Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and former cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) living as fugitives following the events of the last movie. They retreat to Rio de Janeiro upon hearing about a ""job"". Soon they find themselves fixated on stealing money from a corrupt Brazillian businessman, and making a fresh start. The FBI has also hired Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) a highly revered DSS agent to track down Toretto and 0'Conner and arrest them both.The film basically becomes a run-of-the-mill heist film that pulls many tricks that countless other heist have done before or better.The pacing of the film is very uneven, the action scenes are fast-paced with quick edits. But when someone isn't driving/running/shooting at something the movie doesn't just slow down - it grinds to a complete halt. This is likely because the dialogue is flat and the way the actors deliver is lacks any real emotion, going through every clich√© in the heist film handbook.Paul walker is his usual bland self, I consider him the king of underacting. Vin Diesel is okay, but his delivery is slurred and not always legible and he looks physically tired throughout most of the film. Every other member of the cast is forgettable, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Sung Kang etc. All the women are underdeveloped sex-objects that all look the same. I can imagine the casting call: 'Call every ""other guy"" from the last 4 movies and see who says ""yes""'. It surprises me to say that Dwayne Johnson was the best actor in this, he seems to actually be trying with his performance and he has a few genuinely badass scenes.The driving scenes in the movie (as far as I could tell) appeared to mostly use practical effects rather than throw a load of CG cars around - I hugely admire this decision and it looks damn good. The climax of this movie is genuinely awesome, the whole part where they're dragging a safe through Rio (as implausible as it may be) is brilliantly shot and edited.Bottom line is this - If you like the last 4 films, you will enjoy this one. If you hated the last films there is absolutely no reason for you to see this because if you do you will hate it even more than those films.I would recommend people to get this movie on DVD as a rental, that way you can skip all the arduous dialogue scenes and go straight to the action.",limoncella-641-42235,4/24/11,2011

The action- was amazing with brilliant scenes of getting cars of a train and jumping on and off buildings with a tad of flying police cars this action was of the hook.

The script- Was funny and clever with every word listen to by the audience you almost were in the movie itself.

The actors: With good actors like these a film is bound to be a big success with the chemistry between the characters and the way the lines where delivered you couldn't of asked for more. Every moment in the scenes you really believed that this was real and the greatness of this movie

The Plot: Was amazing with plenty of twists and turns leaving you in laughter at every end and wondering how they can created a fifth sequel and still make it this brilliant the answer this is something that can just continue and with brilliant director and writers. This will surely stick in your mind

362,9,This really pumps adrenaline...,"The Fast and the Furious was Oh My God! FnF: New Model Original Parts was AMAZIN. If this is true with you, get set for a more pumpin adrenaline session. The movie focuses on Dom, cars and action but in an all together different way. With the backdrop of Rio De Janeiro, it feels needed to add a kick ass character and so comes Dwayne Johnson. Dwayne is like a different spice in the movie and that too so damn easily.A superb hell crazy film, you would love to watch it back to back. And please be seated after you are over with many OMG moments, as when you are done with the movie........BOOOOOOM! comes a surprise after the credits roll up (This is really the cherry over the cake).You love cars, you love them in action and finally if you love watchin a hardcore manly film, this is your take.Go Fast and buy yourself a ticket to epinephrine.",siddharthkrishnadwivedi,5/15/11,2011
365,8,Like a two hour long roller coaster ride.,"After seeing 2 Fast 2 Furious back in '03, I had lost interest in this series. 2 Fast was pretty entertaining, but the story lines were just too similar for my liking. Because of this, I opted not to see Tokyo Drift or 2009's Fast and Furious. But after hearing rave reviews about Fast Five, I decided to give it a shot, and I'm very glad I did.Dominic Toretto, his sister Mia, and Brian O'Conner are in Rio de Janiero trying to start a new life and gain their freedom. But the gang soon finds themselves between a rock and a hard place, as a powerful businessman/drug lord wants them dead and a relentless Fed by the name of Luke Hobbs (played by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) wants them in prison. Needless to say, the story is action-packed, which brings me to the action sequences: they are plentiful and they are intense! A kick-ass fight scene between Toretto and Hobbs was especially memorable for me. Granted, a lot of the stunts are very far-fetched, but what would you expect, this is a Fast and Furious movie, and the seemingly non-stop action makes the 2 hours and 10 minutes a very fun ride. Jaw-dropping action, a fast-paced story, a bold performance by Johnson, and lots of beautiful women; add it all together and you've got a very worthy addition to the Fast and Furious series.",Astyanax85,5/3/11,2011
368,8,Blooper which can ruin the movie :P,"There is a blooper in the movie - "" The villain used his right hand as a key to open the vault in the police station when he went to check out his money but the girl took the impression of his left hand when she met him at the beach and sit on his lap she had her left hand running on her back not the right hand.Since we know that impressions of both the hands are not alike for any human being there is no way they could have used it for opening the locker.Very small but a very silly mistake but when you are making such a high profile movie need to be extra careful.",tushar-kushk9,5/2/11,2011
371,10,"Unexpected, and enjoyable.","I have seen all of the Fast and Furious movies, and I personally felt that after the first movie, the film series degraded.

In 2009, we saw Fast and Furious, which sparked a new direction in the series. Where the first three movies (The Fast and The Furious, 2 Fast 2 Furious, Tokyo Drift) focused heavily on scenes centered around the main characters engaging in some sort of street race or pursuit, Fast and Furious, delivered what seemed to be a 'plot maker' in the sense that it tied a couple of the films together. It focused more on characters, origins,with a well balanced medium of action, racing, as well as character relations and development. I feel that this was a good initiative in freshening up the film series that (again, personally) I felt to be dangling above the sharks.

***Spoilers Ahead***

Fast Five, a sequel to Fast and Furious, proved again that this decision was positively for the better. Even with the current IMDb rating, I wasn't expecting much out of this film, I'll be honest. However, to my surprise this was a very good installment in the series. The action scenes were great, and the casting made them even better. Dwayne Johnson was a great addition to the cast, and seeing all of the main characters from the other 4 films in the series reuniting and having relations was a very nice touch.

I enjoyed the plot more-so than I did in any other Fast and Furious movie. This time around, it felt like they were taking matters into their own hands, rather than just running from some higher power (Chinese Gang in 1, Colombian Drug Lord in 2, Japanese Mafia in 3, etc). It had some unexpected twists, that I didn't see coming until it was abruptly obvious, which was nice.

The vault heist (featured in the trailer) was very entertaining to watch. The destruction was very over the top.. I'm pretty sure they committed a bank vault massacre taking out that bank and all.. but that's beside the point.

The only part I found a little TOO far-fetched, was that the bank vault weighed ten times as much as the cars and they managed to fling it around like a rubber ball on a string.

Other than that, solid movie. My parents hadn't seen the other titles and they enjoyed it too.

Very entertaining, and if you're a fan at all of the other films you will find this to be a surprising take on the film series.",raijian,5/8/11,2011
372,9,444th Review: High Octane Heist in Rio,"FF5 is a real thrill a minute ride - and given that it's over 2 hours long - it never flags or loses it's way for a moment. There's less racing and more action in this one and it could well be the best of the series - intelligent, fun, exciting, and even some heart, this really does have it all - and it a great guys' popcorn movie.The action takes place in Rio - and after corrupt cops and the FBI all start chasing our heroes they decide to go for one last big score both for the money and revenge.Honestly, this is entertaining action, and an absolute knock-out of a movie - don't let the fact that this is the 5th installment fool you - this is full-blown with a real budget and action stars - all in all a truly entertaining movie.",intelearts,8/19/11,2011

374,4,"Pretty average, shallow story, what else did I expect?","Fast and Furios has been going for a while now and while no one pretends that they're great works of art, for however many millions it cost, a blind, gimp monkey could do a better job. This particular installment seems particularly dull, however. The plot is pretty stupid, the one moral character in the story throws away everything she believes in and even the Rock can't help this dismal outing. Here's the lowdown:

Plot: *Some* cars (not as many as you'd like), a harebrained plot to rip off a drug dealer (al a Ocean's Eleven) and the Rock busting some pretty weak moves not seen since his WWE days. Some really dumb drag racing in police cars because I think the director realised that there isn't too much actual racing in this film. And that's really the let-down: they've eschewed the only good thing about the series (the cars) and replaced it was a dumb and unoriginal heist plot. The timeline is also skewed. This one fits in before Tokyo Drift, but I'm not sure where in relation to #4 (presumably afterwards).

Script: Poorly written. The characters don't do anything particularly stupid (they don't do anything particularly good either), but they waste a lot of time. For instance, they try to come up with a scheme to break in (I won't say where) which involves trying to drift around some corners, and then just abandon the idea when it gets too hard. WTF? It's substandard writing.

SFX: Not too bad, but nothing really spectacular.

Characters: Meh.

Overall, it's pretty weak. This film feels like it had a low budget, and tries to pretend it really had more money than it did. The first Fast and Furious was actually okay, mostly because it had neat cars and a reasonable plot (even if it wasn't done very well). The next one was pretty crap. Tokyo Drift was likewise crap, but I actually didn't mind it. Then number 4 was average with a really dumb plot and lost the hottest chick in the series, and now Fast 5 continues that. At least it's consistent.

Anyone who tells you that they're supposed to be like this, they are what they are etc etc, is retarded. In reality, good films actually have decent plots, nice cinematography and well-written characters. A movie about cars can have a reasonable story (it's not that hard) and be well acted. What these people really meant to say was, ""These films have been badly written by a pair of monkeys, unimaginatively shot by a sloth and half-assedly directed by a chicken, but I have no imagination and I liked it"".

375,10,Great action+powerful performance= Fast Five,"I love Fast And Furious movies, all of them had action,story,characters and plots that are interesting to watch, and in my opinion this Fn'F is the best in it's series.The crew is back with Diesel and and Walker with a surprise touch from Dwayne Johnson, O'Connor(Walker) and Toretto(Diesel) find themselves on the other side of the wanted poster and tries to make one last hit as a revenge, not only that they have enough trouble already, now Hobbs(Johnson) a relentless,determined,incorrigible tough nut federal agent who swore that will catch them no matter the cost.The acting is great just what you expect from great names, they blend well together and mesh like a perfect machine. The plot takes it time to build to it's finale and the pace is great. and you will have a couple of moments where your jaws will drop unintentionally from the action scenes in the movie.All in all a great movie that is a must see, you will enjoy it and you friends will enjoy it too, i guarantee that.",L_Knight_91,5/8/11,2011

The rock was rocking in the movie, his character matched his true personality. As in the previous movies stunts performed were mind boggling and full of thrill, can't wait do do them myself. Cool and solid cars as in previous movies. Chicks wearing bikinis and riding hot bikes. Has some irrelevant superman fighting sequences but what about it every movie needs it. Good casting everyone fits well in their characters. Full of awesome stunts from the start to the end. One can never fall asleep while watching such a movie. The heist plot is very difficult to predict till the end which keeps your mind on the movie and not on the chick on the next seat. Full of thrills and twists.

380,9,Fast Five Sequel?,"This movie is pure fantasy and rush that logic does not apply. I always liked the original the best so I would peg this as the second best in the series. This is a definitely a must movie for fans of this genre. After the movie when the credits are playing, there was a cameo scene with Eva Mendez with the Dwayne Johnson at FBI headquarters talking about a robbery using cars.

He was not interested because Toretto was not involved but Mendez told Johnson that he needed to take a second look because a security camera caught the picture of Michelle Rodriquez as one of the robbers who was killed in the fourth movie of this series.

384,4,Potentially billions in economic costs,"I have been an ardent fan of each Fast and Furious. I watch them with the knowledge (and hope) that they will be corny, cheesy, etc. Thats the fun of Fast and Furious Franchise.

This franchise had the potential to be the best fast and furious yet, with people from each movie making appearances. What this movie lacked was what all the others have, there were no in depth scenes outlining the underground culture of brazil, barely and race scenes, and the storyline was too cliché (even for my taste).

Forget all that, and lets think about something else. Throughout the movie (especially the entire ending) innocent individuals HAD to be killed. This movie glorify's being a bone head and killing innocent civilians. It promises that great rewards will come to those who take extraordinary risks without care to the adverse effects on the population. Assume the following, this movie will (through all forms of syndication) reach 50,000,000 people. Of those, this will have a defining influence on at least 5% of impressionable individuals (a modest estimate. So these 2.5 million individuals instead of dedicating their time towards hard work and rigirous study they instead will choose a life of crime with the impossible dream of actually not going to prison. In terms of economic benefit to the country (or shall I say countries) this movie is worse then dropping an atomic bomb on a major metropolitan area.

Fast and furious movies are supposed to be cheesy, but the cheesiness is only acceptable if accompanied by a view of a societys underculture and awesome racing scenes. This movie severely lacked both while managing to mislead the lives of several thousand (if not million) youth.",namsu22,9/25/11,2011
386,10,An AWESOME movie!!,"I am a Fast and Furious fan, and of the essence that made the first film in which there's more than just mindless and spectacular car racing and tuning but there was a sense of family and belonging, then choosing to be faithful to ones new friends even if that means becoming hunted like them. The second and third film were as awesome but they lost that feeling, but in Fast and Furious 4 it went back to the roots that made this franchise so enjoyable and back to its original characters. But coming back to Fast Five, it is just as wonderful and breathtaking. I loved every single second of it! The fight between Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson was EPIC as was the car and safe chase! If it was 3-D I bet the safe would have been coming out at us! Justin Lin understands the franchise and is more than worthy to carry it on. There was of course an echo of the first film with Dwayne Johnson's character letting Toretto and O'Connor go, still saying he'll see them again. That friendship was unexpected but awesome!In short, A MUST SEE MOVIE FOR ANY FAST AND FURIOUS FAN OR NON FAN EVEN. I hope they will make F&F 6 as planned!",mike198326,5/2/11,2011

To add in ""The Rock"" (sorry, Dwayne Johnson) was just an added bonus :-) If you really like action packed movies, this one is for you! I will admit, the scene they did while towing the vault was way too far fetched for me, but then again, that's what they do best. The one thing that this movie was missing, was ""Letty"". Those of you know she died during the last Fast & Furious sequel. She made a perfect balance to Dominic's roughness. I wasn't too surprised to see Vin Diesel's name as producer since I believe he produced the last one. They also gave us a ""wide-open"" ending to make FF-6. Can they do another good one? Who knows, but I would definitely take my chances and go see it.",kowgirl_tina-1,5/1/11,2011
388,8,"Not As Fast, But Five Time The Fury.","Short of the last installment of this franchise I have been pretty satisfied. I enjoyed the sequel. I think the combination of J Singleton and Tyrese made for a humorous follow up, but I think it was a little too chocolate for a vanilla audience. I was reluctant to see Tokyo Drift and mostly because of the Bow Wow factor, but it was a really good film, much in the spirit of The Karate Kid going to Japan. No, not the weak one with Jaden Smith the original and only Karate Kid in my book Machio! This time around, Fast 5 grabs you by the tailpipe and delivers a supercharged, high octane blast that Detroit never saw coming. We finally find out why Vinnie's last name is Deisel. The movie was riddled with a lot of bad one liners, but the action is so rough rugged and raw, you can overlook the fact that these guys are too old to be living life one quarter mile at a time. The Rock is a menace and from an action sense steals the show. Paul Walker further proves that he was never qualified or even capable to have been a federal agent, but is perfect of the do anything for a buddy, pop the e-brake kinda cat.It might sounds like I'm not a fan, but I think with a few tweaks this could have been great instead of really good. If you are expecting over tuned cars with all kinda of tricked out features, this series has matured and it's more about the story than it is the accessories. It's had to talk much about the film without revealing twists and spoilers so stay through the credits for another 2 piece combo that will leave you saying ""Keyser Soze""!

389,5,7.9? Seriously?,"It is difficult for me to get to the theater so when I go I really want it to count, $20 is a lot to spend to waste 2 hours of my life. To this end I review IMDb and RT for guidance. So far, my experience doing this has substantiated the notion that movies with the best ratings are indeed good movies. An averaging of so many movie enthusiast's opinions should be a pretty solid indicator of the overall strength of a film, right? With Fast Five I knew I was taking a chance, the first of the F & F movies being primarily puerile nonsense, the sequels being merely more of the same. But with a rating of 7.9 I figured it was worth a shot. I enjoy a good action movie as much as the next guy. So I shelled out $25 to see the IMAX version and what did I discover? More puerile nonsense. Ridiculous plot line, action sequences that were just plain stupid or made no sense whatsoever. A juvenile exercise in car crashes, over testosteroned overmuscled tough guys grunting at each other amidst a world of scantily clad females, car crashes and shoot outs. A 7.9? Seriously? Is there a way to see how the ratings may be skewed by masses of teenagers who loved this movie? But more importantly: Can I have my $25 back now?",tridjet,5/8/11,2011
393,3,Complete disappointment,"I don't understand how people review this movie as being good. It was terrible. The plot had many loopholes so if you want to appreciate a good story, you can't. Even if you look beyond the loopholes in the story, some of the scenes are just impossible. What I loved about the first movie was the fact that for the most part it was realistic. This movie had too many unrealistic scenes. I'd rather not gives examples cause I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone.Someone described this movie as being a heist film rather than street racing. It was well said, because if you turn a street racing movie into a heist movie, its obviously going to fail. And there is just no way to make a good plot out of it. Just so some people have an idea of how disappointing this movie was... there is no race scenes. At least none that important or anything. It was not a fast and the furious movie at all. It was just a way for them to make so much money.",saintssilhouette,5/9/11,2011

395,9,Vin and The Rock in Summer Fun Movie,"Showcasing Director Justin Lin's signature accelerated precision, Vin Diesel's Dom races beside the speeding train as Paul Walker's Brian leaps into Dom's sports car. Their car immediately careens over a steep chasm into the river below. Diesel and Walker leap in midair out of the car, and plunge into the water. ""Fast Five"" is just great fun. Writer Chris Morgan's story is better than the last ""Fast and Furious"", which isn't saying much. Then again we don't see ""Fast Five"" for the narrative nuances. Non-stop action reigns supreme. Lin has a crisp vibrant visual style, and acumen for insane action. Lin has two cars racing through the streets of Rio dragging a bank vault unleashing mass destruction. Granted this is over the top, and completely original. ""Fast Five"" has stunning Rio de Janeiro locals, gorgeous women, fast cars, and Vin Diesel squaring off against ""The Rock"" Dwayne Johnson. Lin has methodically checked off all the boxes.The theme of family distinguishes ""Fast Five"" from completely superfluous fare. In a quiet moment Dom reminisces about his father. He remembers him working all day, and staying up late at night helping his sister Mia with her homework. He recalls the generous neighborhood barbecues he had. Conversely, Brian has regrets about his father, ""He just wasn't around."" Perhaps he has chance to alter his fate. Amidst the flash, ""Fast Five"" earnestly adheres to family and loyalty.The band is back together in ""Fast Five"", for one last heist. If I am not mistaken one of the band, Han played by Sung Kang died in a previous Lin directed sequel. Stranger things have happened. The accelerated opening sequence recaps the rescue of Dom Toretto, where the last movie ended. Federal agent Brian O'Connor and Dom's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) daringly execute the operation to free Dom from serving an undeserved life sentence. In context what else could that be? Dom risked his life to help Brian solve a heinous crime and bring killer to justice. Lin throttles the adrenaline and velocity in this deadly game of chicken with a prison bus. This is only an omen of things to come.As ""Fast Five"" resumes, Mia (Brewster) and Brian (Walker) have been on the run in Rio. They are seeking to rendezvous with Dom (Diesel). Dom has one last heist in mind: robbing the bank vault in the Rio Police Station with $100 million of crime lord Reyes (slick and villainous Joaquim de Alemeida). Apparently, Reyes' rule and influence knows no bounds in Rio. So Dom assembles his old team. Dwayne Johnson, massive hard muscle, shaved head and goatee, plays singular and intense Federal Agent Hobbs, who is out to bring Dom to justice. He instructs Rio official to ""Stay the f*** out of my way."" Hobbs and his team always get their man. As Hobbs, Johnson is imposing and handles guns and his fists with explosive results. Of course we are waiting for Vin to take on The Rock in the final epic battle. Chris Morgan ingeniously stacks the story. Dom is the thief with a code. Hobbs is the cop with honor. Reyes is the true villain. Much like gravity, we can kind of figure how things will fall.Predictability is some of the charm of ""Fast Five"". Vin Diesel plays to his minimalist strength as Dom. Emotive is not his deal, but that is not required here. He commands the screen, and often surprises in his underplay. Paul Walker has become a pretty good actor. Not much is demanded of him here. He deftly uses his charm and smarts. The Rock is great as Hobbs. He imposes as a formidable rival. Here Johnson's straight arrow persona leverages the story's ultimate conflict. ""Fast Five"" is not going to win any awards. It is just great fun. I look forward to the next sequel.",jon.h.ochiai,5/14/11,2011
403,9,Yes it is good!,"OK, a 5th sequel right! But its good! There is no shame in capitalizing of the fast and the furious name. It is what started the mainstream car movies.I would definitely recommend watching this installment. It is to me they way things should have been all along. Yes, don't get me wrong there are still some far fetched action sequences but ITS A MOVIE! If you cant accept that, get a life.Watch fast five, enjoy it, and wait for number 6. We see what kind of crap gets pushed out from other companies (200MPH for one, this is not an endorsement, do not see it trust me) and you realize how good the F&F movies are. Mabey a little cheesy, but its a movie for your entertainment, so sit back relax, and enjoi.",psi-753-181555,5/11/11,2011
405,8,Probably my favourite in the franchise!,"Fast & Furious 5 is probably the best one in the franchise so far. It has great action sequences that follow the plot and do not drag on for too long without having any significance to the story. There was a great plot, this time Brain O'Connor finally being on the bad side (something I had been waiting for!). The start led immediately off the last movie, where Dom is broken out of prison. Then Brain, Mia and Dom flee to Rio to hide. There they manage to get the cops attention again by helping Vince pull a job. This time they aren't let off lightly- agent Hobbs is on their tail and he won't rest until they're behind bars. (I won't say much more because I don't want to give anything away!)I was thrilled to see all the old characters from all the movies back together again hatching brilliant mastermind plots and carrying them out so slick and smooth. I found that the first and fourth movie were a bit boring and lacked the amount of action and plot to keep me interested- My favourites were the second and third, though it was a disappointment not to have Vin Diesel in them. The only bring down in Fast Five was the lack of awesome cars like the ones in Tokyo drift. I was kind of looking forward to amazing paint jobs, races and girls like the first few but there were less of them in this one. That was the only disappointment. Came out of the cinema buzzing, more than pleased and excited for the next one! Yes! Live on Fast & Furious franchise!",EmmaGoose,5/1/11,2011
406,9,"If you miss all the stars in the previous parts, don't lose it!","I watched the movie few days ago and I enjoyed it very much. The storyline, casting, directing and more specially the team of stars in the previous fasts. In fact, all stars in the previous parts play their role in this part (sometime very short) and gathering such a group of actors in a sequel is unique after ""Godfather 3"".The story is a little different with previous parts and this time, the movie is more similar to movies like ""Italian job"". However the storyline is really interesting and it causes you forget the time. I give 9 because I think that some part of the movie is not very logical (like stealing the police cars scene).Generally I suggest the movie to every racing movies lover and moreover action movies.",behnamgamer,5/16/11,2011
409,8,Big. Dumb. Awesome.,"There's a scene about half an hour in to Justin Lin's Fast Five, the latest film in the car racing Fast & Furious franchise, where federal agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) angrily throws a clipboard to the floor as his explanation of something that ""makes sense"". It's this moment that totally sums up Fast Five: a film you can enjoy only by casting logic aside and simply surrendering to the bombastic absurdity you're witnessing. Luckily for those of us able to do this, the film is one of the best examples of big dumb action of the past decade.This series seems to be on something of a one good/one bad streak, with the first, third, and this fifth film all being worthwhile, somewhat original examples of the big-budget summer blockbuster. Picking up directly where the fourth film (2009's Fast & Furious) left off, no time is wasted in getting to the action, and the opening bus assault places us in familiar territory, setting up the mostly unimportant plot with a spectacular, physics-(not to mention logic) defying stunt to get pulses racing. Where the film departs from the tried and true formula of its predecessors however is in blending the heist film genre with the vehicle-based action, and the decision to shake things up was a smart one. The biggest problem with the previous film was that it just seemed kind of pointless, but here Lin uses the 'one last job' team heist plot as an excuse to reunite characters from every previous entry in the franchise, and indeed the film feels like it belongs more to the Ocean's Eleven canon than Fast & Furious. The series' celebrated 'car porn' is still present, yet Lin wisely opts for more variety than ever before, including more direct character conflict (fighting!), and thrilling parkour-esque foot chases across the rooftops of Rio de Janeiro.While it is fun to see so many previous cast members returning to form the team (similarities with 2010's Inception abound here), undoubtedly the greatest part of Fast Five is the introduction of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson as Agent Hobbs, a kind of 'super-cop' sent in to nab only the most wanted criminals. Johnson, looking so absurdly massive that he dwarfs even Vin Diesel, adds an extra layer of beefcake to a film already dripping with testosterone, and he seems to be loving every minute. Throwing out hilariously macho one liners (""Gimme the damn veges!"") in between breaking necks and jumping out of windows, he fits so perfectly into the film that every time he wasn't on screen I found myself just waiting for him to come back. Perhaps my biggest complaint is that he should have had more screen time, but in a film already juggling around a dozen characters, you can't always get what you want. There's always the inevitable sixth entry into the franchise, where hopefully Agent Hobbs will play more of a role.Certainly Fast Five shines in the action scenes, but things aren't so successful if one foolishly tries to think about the logic of the narrative. While it's an interesting move to have Brian (Paul Walker) turning away from his FBI career to help his friend Dom (Diesel), it's hard to see these characters as heroic in any sense. Their desperate self-preservation antics betray a shockingly callous disregard for any innocent bystanders. One would do better to not think about the number of fatalities in the various scenes of destruction around Rio, and even Agent Hobbs and his team, the most obvious 'good-guys', brutally kill their fair share of people. The film attempts to portray all of the people killed as stereotypical corrupt cops and officials, but I did find the amount of violence from the supposed 'heroes' of the film a little distressing. Add to that around 30 minutes of planning for the climactic heist that ultimately becomes unnecessary after a plot twist that changes the whole plan, and the problems with Fast Five's script start to show their presence. But obviously this series was never intended to be admired for its storytelling, and any concerns about the plot are chased away by the excellent action sequences.With Fast Five, Justin Lin has arguably crafted the finest film yet in the franchise. Everyone involved seems to know what this movie needed to be, from the stunning use of practical effects that more than makes up for the awful CGI of the previous film, to the way the ensemble of past characters really pushes the series' constant theme of doing everything for your friends and family. Undoubtedly we will see these characters again, and there is potential for maybe one more outing to round off the story of Dom and Brian. Hopefully Fast Six or whatever silly thing it is eventually titled will match the quality of this entry.",markdroulston,6/15/11,2011
415,10,The Greatest Fast and the Furious since the first one and its even better!!!!!,"Im not usually a fan of sequels, considering a lot of them are not as good as the original, this was indeed the case with the Fast and the Furious franchise, the first one was purely original and fun to watch while the sequels were not as good. This movie however proved me wrong. This Fast and the Furious story takes place after the fourth movie and picks up right from where they left it off and immediately finishes off with little time to take in. Dominic Played by Vin Diesal has broken out of prison with the help of Paul Walker and Doms sister. The overall story is not the most original thing I've ever heard of but in a way its a nice turn for the series considering the second movie felt more like an episode then a movie, i have no idea what the third movie was, and the fourth was a repeat of the first movie. This time around, Paul is not a cop but rather a fugitive on the run, i really liked this turn for him because i often wondered how many times could they allow him to return to being a cop. Many characters from the past movies come back here, so if you haven't seen the past movies, you will be lost as to who's who and whats their role to play in the story. New to this story is Dwayne Johnson who plays a ruthless but hardcore villain who is determined to capture Dom and his group. I gotta say, this is one of the only film roles i have seen Dwayne in that i actually like, i think he finally found the role that may define the rest of his career. The fight between Dwayne and Vin was indeed the Arnold and Sylvester fight everyone has been waiting for since the 80's. The movie has tons of girls in bikinis, fast cars, and a lot more action this time around. My only complaint if anything is the beginning, i kind of wish they hadnt rushed it like they did, im the kind of person that enjoys a good introduction, and the beginning was alittle too much emphasis, so thats about it everything else was fantastic. Also the shocking revelation in the end may send shivers down hardcore fans of the genre, others will not understand it, but i will say for those of you who have seen the past movies, you will get a real kick out of the ending, for those of you who haven't, see the past ones before seeing this one. If you have already given up on the franchise, watch this movie to change your frame of mind, it will make a difference.",yora217,5/6/11,2011
419,8,Summer truly has begun!,"Summer begins April 29.And yes, yes it did.This movie was friggin' awesome! I thought Fast & Furious was the best of the franchise, but Fast Five has completely blown all of its predecessors out of the water! Despite it completely breaking all laws of physics (especially including a scene where a small muscle car manges to trip a bus over) the movie was awesome. This makes a Fast and the Furious movie worth watching! Being a huge fan, I loved this movie to death.Never has a movie made me sweat in the theater seat and pump me full of so much adrenaline that I almost peed my pants.They drive a SAFE through the STREET!The other awesome part of this film is that it's a Fast and the Furious movie with a story and more depth to the characters. The previous movies were meant solely for their action and this one does that, too... Plus some more!I got the honorable pleasure to see this pulse pounding film in IMAX and it was worth every cent. I suggest that, for the full effect, you see it in IMAX as well. This is the pure testosterone of 2011. 2010 had The Expendables and 2008 had Rambo, now Sylvester has met his match, and his name is Justin Lin.",tsettles98,4/30/11,2011
422,5,"Not bad, if you ignore some of the most unrealistic scenes EVER!","Just like the summary above, good action scenes, lots of car crashes, but come on! I know it's supposed to be a movie, but some of these scenes are down right the most unrealistic I have EVER seen.

Actually almost all the main scenes were absurd! 1. The fight scene between the Rock & Toretto, GIMME A BREAK! One punch in the face from either of those guys would just about kill the other one. I guess nobody watches real fighting.

2. The fall from the bridge! COME ON, again! 50-70mph off a car over a cliff that was easily over 60 feet, probably more like 100 feet = 99% certain death. The other 1% you would have a broken body.

3. The BEST one of all...the final safe scene! I won't even try, you'll see....or maybe not.

This isn't a horrible movie, just not a great one. Could have been a lot better. What is worse is the people who actually give this 9 or 10 stars!",themaxx69,5/1/11,2011
423,8,Fast Five is a great movie,"I saw fast five a week ago and I was wondering what it would be like because I hadn't seen the four films before it. It was an awesome movie.

This movie is set in Rio and the main characters are pulling off a heist. That's about all of the plot I'll give away but I will say there is an awesome seen in the movie where Vin Diesel's character (Dominick Toretto) has an epic fight scene with Dwayne Johnson's character (Detective Dobbs).

I really recommend this movie to everyone.

I would give this movie a 7-7.5/10. I liked the movie, it had action, it had some pretty girls, it had some mad actors, it had some car racing(only a scene or two) and it had a bank heist, what else would you want from a movie? Highly Recommended 7-7.5/10.",jz61,4/30/11,2011

I really enjoyed this movie, and I'm a picky one.My favorite movie since the first one..and I actually think this may have been even better.GO SEE THIS MOVIE NOW. IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT IT, GO!

THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME!!! Tyrese Gibson was freaking hilarious in the film as was Don Omar, they were honestly one of my favorite actors in the entire film. It wasn't just a whole bunch of cars everywhere it actually had a good plot and a really good twist. The Rock was hot as always and he did a really good job in the film as well. All in all i like this installment better than any other one I have seen, including the first one.

You won't be disappointed and neither will your local venue as you guzzle through 3 boxes of popcorn. Otherwise, if you enjoy: a) Plots that don't make you face palm yourself. b) Actors that can actually act. c) Movies that adhere to the physical laws of this universe. d) Dialogue which doesn't make you roll your eyes every 15 minutes.STAY AWAY! It was a pain to watch if you came in there with expectations of a decent film, but if you came in there to see crazy stunts and babes then you probably won't leave too disappointed.

432,5,Mildly interesting heist film,"thefilmsmith.com If you're a film critic aiming to be taken seriously you draw up reviews of awesome little-known films like Night of the Hunter and level sniper shots at the latest Transfomers flick. Anything heavily marketed to mass audiences is normally regarded as terrible before official screenings begin, and that sentiment isn't without its reasons. But even the most erudite critic has a guilty pleasure, and mine happens to be any film that tries to do as much real special effect work as possible before going to the computer, which is what made me curious about Fast Five.Paul Walker and Vin Diesel return to the franchise that launched their careers, this time hiding in Rio de Janeiro when a 100 million dollar heist presents itself.Despite featuring characters who are notable only for their attractiveness and angry faces, this 2 hour heist film manages to milk some character development. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson hams it up nicely as the DEA agent chasing Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, and Walker is mercifully not given many lines. Instead, director Justin Lin introduces the characters with an impressive train heist and incorporates quieter moments that don't clash with the rest of the film.The actual heist sequence illustrated in the film's trailer is what intrigued me, but within the film it's delivered with mixed results. A scrapyard somewhere made a killing off the film, with plenty of vehicles getting mashed, crashed, and thrashed with nary a digital effect interrupting the fiasco (at least blatantly; it definitely played a supporting role). Kudos. After a while though, the auto body kill count becomes numbing and never manages to deliver a cherry on top of this metal mash-up sundae (think the truck flip from The Dark Knight).Despite being the fifth sequel in a car racing franchise that still bears of the scars of its adolescence, it isn't a bad action film. Sure, the film has some bad moments (it still retains its awkward homoerotic tension between angry ogre men), but overall it's bearable.If you're interested in the film's special effects, it might be worth your time. Other than that, I'm not sure why else someone would want to see it. Vin Diesel's shiny head? -Remington Smith",electrablind,4/29/11,2011
437,4,Fast & Furious 5 (2011),"This film lost me in the first few minutes. A rescue operation sees Paul Walker flipping over a bus about ten times to save one person. This stupid scene is followed by a TV news reporter stating ""miraculously no one was hurt"". This is such lazy writing that it annoys me no end. Why not think of something clever, rather than this moronic idea. I'm all for suspending disbelief, but there's no reason to exploit an audience like that. It happens again later, where characters, inexplicably, have knowledge or skills not previously assigned to them. All the characters say is ""I had a life before you knew me!"" This isn't good enough, it's just lazy. This basically means that anything can happen in this movie, and the writers are using get out of jail free cards. On top of that the franchise has lost the racing entirely, at one point building up to a race and then cutting to the conclusion. At times I thought I was watching Bourne. It all adds up to a roll call of previous characters, and an ending that sees Diesel using a safe chained to his car as a weapon, and not just one of destruction, he is able to aim this with all the precision of an Olympic archer. It's a bizarre beast, as it takes itself the most seriously out of all the movies, but comes across as the dumbest.",SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,12/13/11,2011
439,9,Just Ate my Own Words.,"The 1970 trailer for the biker classic, Hell's Belles summed it up perfectly: ""Hip chicks with an itch for the kind of action that takes a lot of manÔªø to scratch!"" That same mentality prevails in all of the F&F series and as I've always said before: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.In my Thor review, I slated Fast Five without seeing it; and now, I stand here before my legion of fans, holding my head (and spiky bonce) in shame. They say that no one talks about Fight Club, true. But when it's Fast & Furious, remember one thing: Leave your brain at home and set your motor to auto-cruise. Hey, I'm even 100% sure that NASA's finest could figure out the logistics and physics of cutting open the side of a fast moving train, but this is what F5 does: It's so ludicrous that you just have to give up and suspend disbelief until you come back to reality (haha, I made an Inception joke there, nice!) Fast Five does what it says on the poster and doesn't allow you to breathe a lot. Within 5 mins of the opening scene, we see Vin Diesel's Dom, being rescued by his family (whilst he's in a moving prison vehicle no less!) And a credit to the writers, they shift gears as quickly as they can and take us to Rio De Janeiro (yes, not a CGI city, but actually Rio, no orange Macaws plugging 3G crap, thank God!) What we then get after, is a fairly sane plot of a corrupt official Reyes (the always cool Joaquin De Almeida) who seems to have more money than God. After this Kingpin kills a member of the wannabe Ocean's 11 crew, Dominic wants revenge as only he knows how! Except, he didn't bargain on Special FBI bounty hunter, Hobbs (Dwayne The Rock Johnson). As Paul Walker's Brian O'Conner says: ""Vey Old Testament"". Say what you like about wrestlers-cum-actors, but DJ is better than 50 Cent, in that he actually took acting lessons and is the best thing about F5. In fact, Vin Diesel has been in this franchise for a while now, and wisely takes a back seat for the Rock and his motormouth do the talking. And this is what I liked: We're promised a showdown with 2 behemoths (albeit 3, if you count Vin's belly). While I do like the Bourne films, those frigging quick cuts in the action is off putting; but here, Justin Lin keeps it old school and even out does the Expendables and its constant clumsiness, by giving us a solid beat-down between the Tooth Fairy & XXX. It's A-Team style, punch-em-in-the-face with no suplex in-jokes. The Rock is in phenomenal shape and twice the size of Diesel (I for one, cannot wait until 2012 when he does a one-off reunion with WWE and takes out John Cena!) The women in F&F have 2 purposes: They're good wheel drivers and wield wrenches for self-defense. On the other hand, the ones who aren't allowed to speak on camera, simply let their finely tuned asses and over-the-crotch hot pants do the talking (not that I'm complaining you understand)...Gisele (Gal Gadot) is a skinny chick with balls and needs to eat more burgers if she wants to convince Sports Illustrated, she can cut it on their front cover. Elsa ""Tacky"" Pataky is good as Elena, the cop with a ""nice smile"" and wished she'd been in a bikini instead. But as always, my heart goes to Jordana Brewster as Mia. She'll never win an Oscar (like she gives a rat's ass!) but remains as beautiful as ever (and appeared in season 2 of Chuck, so clearly she has taste).There was great interplay with the rest of the cast too, especially with Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Chris Bridges) and their schoolboy put downs. And with a movie that takes itself seriously with action and very little CGI, a smattering of humour is always welcome in my books.A few observations I noticed: Had Dominic Toretto and his motley crew watched Top Gear UK, they would've known that a TVR is the only car that could beat a speed camera (duh!) Also, don't even tell me that no-one has played Modern Warfare 2, because anyone who has (veteran, cough!) will be familiar with the Favela chapter and here, it's brought to the screen with some real ferocity, right down to the roof top chases. And just to reinforce the demographic F5 is aimed out, look no further than Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, which they clearly emulated in the last 20 mins. And there were 2 other moments I cried (the first being Elena) - Mia driving a GT40 and Dom's 1970 Charger getting crushed (noooooo!) And if you're going to acquire the top sports car in the Western Hemisphere, at least have the decency to grace us with a band of attractive women to double the viewing pleasure! As my good American cyber friend Ashley said: ""Stick around after the end credits"". F&F6 is on the cards; but F5 could've tied-up its loose ends very neatly. I gave this movie 5/5 because it's F for Fun and after you leave, you'll think you've just been on the best amusement park ride, ever! Whether Justin Lin is the right man for the Terminator reboot is debatable - (don't get me wrong, I'm happy for the Far East Asian brother to hit the big time, and that Sung Kan gets a love interest who's out of his race!) but if Justin himself can contact me, we need to sit down and do some serious talking!",SkidMcCormick,5/7/11,2011
440,8,Maybe Too Fast !!,"Fast Five was exactly what I expected. Fast, lots of action and car chases.At some point events made no sense to me. and i think maybe the reason for that is the the new characters have no depth to them.But on the other hand if you are a fan of big car chases and explosions, you could have a lot of fun watching this.The acting was pretty good. Van diesel was my favorite as always. If watch the trailer you will see that its pretty much the same thing in the movie. i mean all of the important scenes are in the tailer.But this film is the best out of all of them. And it could be the best action film of the year.Oh, and if you are going to watch it, make sure that you watch the clip after the Credits !!!",LordElrondd,5/7/11,2011

It's so entertaining to watch and having all the cast back was awesome! Practically every hot car makes and appearance and then of course you have the hot men :) Vin Diesel and Paul Walker had great on screen chemistry that made me love them even more. Adding back the rest of the old cast members made for a great humor addition to the movie. Turn off your analytical brain and just sit back and enjoy the ride! Fun!",lindseyholcombe18,4/30/11,2011
447,3,I Am a Fan No More,"As much as I disliked this movie, to be honest, it was not terrible. In fact, if it were just any movie, I probably would have enjoyed it. However, it was a Fast and Furious movie (a series that I have been a huge fan of). When I went to the fourth movie, I did not go in expecting much, but to my surprise I found it to be one of the best in the series, which gave me high hopes for this one. Unfortunately, I ended up seeing a movie that was full disappointing action. It ripped away all the major things that the past Fast and Furious movies had been about. There were a lot of good, unrealistic, but good action sequences, but there was hardly any racing, or even much focus on cars for that matter. The only short racing scene in the whole movie doesn't even have street cars, they all race identical charger cop cars. Like I said, I don't think the movie is a poorly filmed movie, but I think that anybody who is a true fan of the series will be seriously let down. If you don't know much about the series but want a good action movie, then watch it. If you are a die hard Fast and Furious fan trust me when I say avoid this movie so that you can keep the series pure in your own mind.",srgt,11/24/11,2011
451,10,There we go,"So I went to watch Thor today and it was OK but then right after I went into another screen where Fast Five was playing and then thats when I felt like I paid to watch a movie.Let me quickly go through the first four films. The Fast and The Furious introduced the idea of an action film that can be done with cars readily available on the streets like the Mitsubishi Eclipse or Honda Civic. 2 Fast 2 Furious introduced the repeated villain in the franchise which is the powerful drug-lord. Fast and Furious brought in the crazy action but somehow wasn't able to expand its potential. Tokyo Drift was a complete abomination and felt completely unnecessary.Fast Five really seals in the gaps and blends all the best elements from the previous 3 (I will not include Tokyo Drift in this!!!) and wow, its a great theatrical experience.Rio was used as a setting and even though that's becoming a little played out, it's still brilliant because it allows for brilliant action sequences. Whether it's a rooftop chase in the favela, a motorcade ambush by a favela gang or an intense high speed chase sequence with two cars hauling a vault (you saw that in the trailer no big spoiler).Overall everything is so much better, character development, plot lines and story lines, action sequences and even emotion. It does go Hollywood though meaning there is a good amount of suspension of disbelief.I loved it, its good not only as a Fast and Furious film but as a film in its own merit. It took 4 films before but it finally hit the mark.",arnieiam,5/6/11,2011
452,5,I expected more action and it was too long,"After I have read all the positive international reviews I thought this must be a real action movie and above all the best one of this franchise. But I was wrong because in my opinion there were only three great respectable scenes with full of adrenaline. The remaining story was too long. The running time could have been reduced at maximal 95 minutes. There were dialogs where I felt nearly asleep. The characters and actors didn't convince me. Then I missed a fresh and intelligent story with intriguing, mysterious or adventure elements to take me definitely on a great ride in Rio. The story is so simply sticked as in The Expendables or Swordfish. That's why this movie is far away from blockbusters such as DIE HARD, TERMINATOR, JAMES BOND or THE BOURNE IDENTITY series. I am so disappointed and I won't give another chance in future. Too overrated on IMDb. My vote is slow five out of ten.",Luigi Di Pilla,9/11/11,2011

This movie has everything unlike other remakes were not having that much as they would have expected. But this one will surprise you all. It has speed n cars for which fast & furious series is known. Along with this it has the perfect story, twists & turns. And if I talk about action that this movie has got so much in it. Jonathon was great in his role n all others played their roles very well. So don't waste your time in reading reviews just go and watch this movie.

465,9,AWESOME! That's all I can say.,"AWESOME! That's all I can say. The action is great, the story is great, the music is great, the cars are again out of this world (ok, not really :-)), the character interaction and character development are great and just as in part 1, it's the 'team' that makes the movie for me. A team which I as a viewer want to be a part of.Where they started falling into the sequel trap with releasing sub-par movies after the first one, come part 4 they completely turned it around. By bringing back the original cast and by adding some much needed character development and 'real' characters they instantly created a blockbuster hit. And now part 5 is even better imho. They expanded on the back stories of the characters and the story of the movie as a whole. A story which I believe is better than the fourth movie and even rivals the first one. Keep in mind though that we are still not talking about Oscar material, but as a summer, sorry ... spring :-), blockbuster it comes highly recommended.If they continue like this I definitely wouldn't mind if they made 5 more of these.",Dschadir,5/7/11,2011
468,9,Just keeps getting better,"You know, it is hard to sustain a franchise today through 3 movies, much less 5. But with the FF franchise, not only have the last two films regained the momentum, they have gotten better! The latest entry, FastFive, is unquestionably the best of the franchise to date.

FastFive takes the franchise beyond the fast cars and lovely girls genre and has turned itself into a bone-fide action/adventure franchise. There are enough of the fast cars and women elements, but the focus is now on character and story. A far cry from the humble beginnings of the series.

We get re-introduced to many friends from the past films and along with that, we get Dewayne Johnson, who comes into the film and chews up the scenery. He and Vin Diesel's confrontation is an action fans dream. And we are not let down.

The story follows Dom and Co. directly after he has been sprung from the prison bus that was taking him to jail. We get caught up with where everyone is and are introduced to Johnson's FBI agent character. From there we are with the gang as they come to the realization that only through a big score can they truly get free of their pursuer and get to a country with no extradition. So they call up some old friends who come in and from minute one, the film switches to another gear and never lets up. Oh by the way, a long with the gang being pursued by the FBI, they have run afoul of the local drug cartel leader. Their plan to escape with loads of cash has Dom and Co. scheming to relief the cartel of their millions through a daring heist. The scenes of the whole gang together remind me of the first film in that there was a sense of family. That was lacking in the last 3 entries and it was a welcome return to see everyone together.

The action is the best of the series yet with the vault through the streets being the highlight of the final act. Rio was a great place to take the series.

Performances are all solid here, Diesel and Walker actually showing some depth to the characters they are all but totally in command of here. Everyone here is just great, the camaraderie is easy to see and feel and you are literally having fun with seeing the gang back together.

By all means, see this in the theater. I did not see the IMAX version, so can't attest to how good it looks there. But by all means, get out and see this. Make sure to stay through the initial credits, there is a MAJOR hint at what Fast Six has in store for us.",RCWjr,4/29/11,2011
469,10,They're Fast and they're furious.,Fast Five opens with a daring jailbreak. and from that point on it sets the tone for the movie. Fast Action incredible stunts and credible story to keep everything moving smoothly. Dominic Toretto has been broken out of jail by Former FBI agent Brian O'Connor and Toretto's sister Mia. Once they free Dominic they're on the run for their lives. their race for freedom takes them to Brazil broke and penniless Brian and Mia wait for Dom at the home of a old friend Vince. While they wait for Dom Vince offers Brian a chance at a job the job is to steal three cars off a moving train. Brian and Mia both take the job and join Vince as they move to do the job Dom shows up and helps them do the job. things go wrong from there. the cars are under DEA protection and the gang double crosses Dom Brian and Mia. Mia escapes in one car that holds a secret and Brian and Dom fight for their lives in a breathtaking scene. In the End three DEA agents are dead and the DEA brings in Hobbs a old style gunfighter type of agent he's relentless he's ruthless and he's targeted Dom and his friends for the deaths of his friends. meanwhile Dom and Brian find out Mia is pregnant. On the run with enemies around them Dominic Toretto decides it's time for one last job and then after that disappear forever. Needing help they gather the ultimate superteam for the ultimate heist. and meanwhile the supercop Hobbes is closing in on our band of heroes.The pace is fast the twists are surprising and the acting is solid. this is the best entry in the F and F franchise yet. If Fast Five is this good I wonder how they can top it with Furious six? Oh and stay after the credits for a scene that'll set up furious six and make you want to see that one. Fast five has all the power of a 1970 dodge Charger and all the speed of a Dodge Challenger worth seeing if this is your type of movie.,bluesman-20,5/12/11,2011
477,5,At Least the Cars Were Cool,"Fast Five, another installment to the blockbuster series starring Vin Diesel, gave me mixed feelings. To organize my thoughts, I'll put the aspects of the film in a pros and cons list. Pros: The camera work surprisingly wasn't irritating to watch, as one might expect of a movie revolved around car racing. The action sequences, although far-fetched (as any action movie), was inventive and clouded with clear sound effects that fit the scenes. Cons: The whole movie seemed like a competition of who could deliver the most one-liners. The screenplay was limited, saying only what the audience expected them to say. The characters were shallow and stereotypic; no character stood out from the rest. On a 10 star scale, this movie would fairly deserve 5 stars.",ku2244,5/2/11,2011
479,8,You'll get what you paid for.,"this is best one of the franchise, the action is just in your face. I only saw the first two Fast and the Furious sequels. I didn't see the 3rd or the 4th. But when I saw trailer to this, I knew it was a film not to be missed, and I was right.

Dominic(Vin Diesel), Brian(Paul Walker), and Mia(Jordana Brewster) hatch a plan for the perfect heist, they put together a team, and map out the plan, but it gets short sided when a enforcement agent(Dwayne The Rock Johnson) is hot on there trail, and he and his team will stop at nothing till they bring down Dominic and his team down. but will they?

In all these movies the shiny cars become a character themselves. The action is ten times intense then ever, it has awesome chase scenes. Not to mention an awesome confrontation between Vin Diesel and Dwayne The Rock Johnson, watching those two muscle bound action stars slug it out on film, is like a dream come true. like I said you'll get what you paid for.",DarkVulcan29,5/2/11,2011
481,8,Another episode of a successful movie series; the fifth and likely not the last.,"Read the full IMDb Storyline of Fast Five to get an overview of the plot. In my well founded opinion, to start with, this fifth episode is the first to have a realistic bridging of the ending of the previous episode and the setup for this current episode, the one with the highest rating of all five so far; it works well and immediately engages the hesitant audience who want nothing more than a believable continuation.

All the action sequences of this fifth episodes are well done, very well done in fact, and do not suffer from inconsistent CGI and Fx quality, present in prior episodes; here, the quality is superior and effective throughout, a big plus and one I'm convinced contributed to the 7.4 rating (at time of my review). The cast which featured characters from all prior four episodes was another simple but sure way to maximize the production value. The last action sequences where the Dominic Toretto group pull their most daring and smartest heist is a gem. You'll want to replay that over.

Let me provide you with some overview of the characters and the series so you can have an idea of where I believe the next sequel(s) will take us. The Fast and The Furious Original (2001) (rated 6.1), 2 Fast and 2 Furious (2003) (rated 5.2), The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) (rated 5.6), Fast & Furious (2009) (rated 6.4) and finally ""Fast Five (2011) (rated 7.4). -Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto in 2001, 2006(only as a brief closing scene consolidating his series value), 2009 and 2011. -Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner in 2001, 2003, 2009 and 2011. -Michelle Rodriguez as Letty in 2001, in 2009 (believed to have died in 2009), is in the 2011 ending, taunted to be alive (via a current dated picture) for the implicit sixth episode we should expect. -Jordana Brewster as Mia Toreto in 2001, in 2009 and 2011. -Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pierce in 2003 and in 2011. -Ludacris as Tej in 2003 and 2011. -Tego Calderon as Bandoleros in 2006 and as Tego in 2011. -Matt Schulze as Vince in 2001 and 2011 (dies). -Sung Kang in his role as Han from the 2006 and 2011. -Gal Gadot as Gisele in 2009 and in 2011. -Eva Mendes as Monica Fuentes in 2003 and appears as same at the end of 2011 along with Dwayne Johnson in the brief scene that leads to believe there will likely be a 6th episode. -Dwayne Johnson as Luke Hobbs introduced in 2011 near the middle of the 2011 film; at the end with Eva Mendes are taunted to appear in the sixth episode.

I look forward to episode 6 and 7, which no doubt will feature at least Dwayne Johnson, Eva Menendez, Vin Diesel and hopefully Michelle Rodriguez for episode 6. I will venture a guess that episode could maintain a rating of 7 if the same writers and director of the last two episodes can hire the same special Fx and CGI bunch; the success of Fast Five should help the producers secure an adequate budget for the 6th episode. I trust, as evidenced by the 7.4 rating of 'Fast Five' that both episode 6&7 due to be produced in 2012, will be. I'm a fan who can now openly admit to it. Watch ""Fast Five"", perhaps you can become a fan as well. I don't mind commercial success if the quality holds up.",JohnRayPeterson,10/11/11,2011
486,8,Preposterous Fun,"I viewed this ""blind"" without having seen any of the previous ""Fast & Furious"" offerings. Previously a series which apparently involved car theft and street racing held little appeal . I am pleased to report that my preconceptions were wrong, and I thoroughly enjoyed two hours and twenty minutes of preposterous fun.

The moral problem of rooting for robbers is side-stepped by the fact that they are robbing from even badder guys – a drug baron and his cartel. Vin Diesel enjoys himself enormously as the robbers head honcho, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson enjoys himself even more as Hobbs his special forces nemesis charged with hunting him down.

The plot itself is a classic Hollywood formula. The robbers double cross each other, the good guys are sent to catch the bad guys who are out to steal from the even badder guys. The chief good guy hooks up with the prettiest girl, the bad guys come unstuck, but so do the good guys, who then form an understanding to thwart the even badder guys.

Director Justin Lin directs with style and brio with car scenes used sparingly, and therefore very effectively, the gaps being filled in with old fashioned heists, rip-offs, foot chases and shoot-outs. Elena Neves as the honest cop is hot and shades Jordana Brewster as the gangsters moll. The Brazilian/ Rio location shots are milked for all they are worth with plenty of swooping over the favelas, Christ the Redeemer ,the Corcovado mountain and the Copacabana.

The climax, a raid on a vault is plain silly, but great fun and Paul Walker is excellent throughout playing alongside Vin Diesel. A minor problem is that the normally imposing Diesel is physically dwarfed by Dwayne Johnson who is clearly here to stay for the next instalment. An adrenaline rush from start to finish with blue skies, stunning scenery, pretty girls, muscle bound guys and fast cars , clichéd? Yes. Fun ? Hell, yes too!",gary-444,5/31/11,2011
490,8,HELL YER! Fast Five,"when i first saw the trailer i said HELL YERR IM SEEING IT! i wanted to see it so bad that i booked 4 seats for me and my other 3 friends and they said to me 'we don't have money to see it' an i said 'i don't care if u don't have any money, ill pay for all of us' which is what i ended up doing. And luckily i did book the seats cause it was PACKED. From start to finish i was happy with the movie an how they did it. an cause the cinema was full we decided to wait till everyone left, luckily we did cause they show a small clip after the cast. i loved it so much that i wanted to go see it again. but it was sold out. my mum hasn't seen any of the fast and furious movies and she went and seen fast five, i couldn't believe her and she even said that she enjoyed it.Its a sequel WORTH your money!!",lose-my-mind,5/4/11,2011
494,10,Fast Five Gives you exactly what you want,"Every year, moviegoers can depend on the franchise to release an entry with every character the audience wants (whether dead or alive), six of the most ridiculous and implausible car scenes you'll ever see in your life, and at least one scene where Vin Diesel/Paul Walker's acting is so bad that the audience literally laughs at him in a serious scene. Every summer, an academic on his way to that new French subtitled film that ""the New Yorker just loved!"" scoffs at me as I march to the theater, but why? I can't think of a series that more successfully gives the audience exactly what they pay $12 to see. Five out of Five stars!

501,10,Out of Control,"First of all public disclaimer....I liked the 1st two iterations in the series; I couldn't stand three and didn't even watch four. Sufficed to say, I was skeptical going into Fast Five. Bottom Line, It was the best movie that I've seen seen this year by far, I liked Hanna a lot, but I loved Fast Five. It was exciting, hilarious, disgusting, crazy, and did I mention exciting already. It was like Ocean's Eleven skill with Transformers 2 Action.Character Development greatly exceeded the previous 4, Background Stories, Cinematography in Brazil never disappointed, Dialogue was clever, Special Effects, Stunts and Fight Scenes, Gunplay, Plot Twists.....Out of ControlWell done and I can't imagine how it could have been any better.",tdedmondjr,4/30/11,2011
504,8,Undeniably awesome.,"I dare anyone to name the 4th sequel of a franchise (not based on previously known material) that is actually considered a decent movie on it's own? That's right, if there are any, I doubt it's more than a handful.But to call this a decent movie is a gross understatement. If looked at for pure entertainment value, this is probably one of the best action movies I have seen in the last 5 years. You can call the whole thing over-the-top, I don't care, to be honest, that would also be an understatement.The thing is, every movie, even bad ones have a redeeming factor to them. Either it's a certain actor's performance, a unique story or brisk visuals. With this franchise it's always been about cars, babes and action. And it handles the action so exceedingly well this time around that you forget the cheesy moments, you forget you're at the movies, it's like you're right in the middle of it, from the very start.No doubt the cars are beautiful, the girls are gorgeous and the acting is exactly what you would expect. But the story actually has a subplot which gives the movie more emotional depth. Money and freedom is the motivator for these guys, but by doing what they do best they aren't just fighting for their own freedom. This is touched upon a couple of times and it gives the story a good moral boost.And if there isn't something being completely demolished on the big screen it's the trash-talking that keeps the pace at a high level. Laughter guaranteed.I can't recommend this movie enough for action junkies or people who just want to have a good time at the cinema. So if this hasn't been enough...Picture Ocean's Eleven, now think cars, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and a lot of eye-popping violence.Yeah that should do it.",Kungloa,5/8/11,2011
505,8,Fast Five - It will NOT disappoint ANYONE!! not even the critics!,"Just returned from the weekend show and; without having watched 3 of the sequels of this famous franchise and only going because of a strong marketing and promotion basically, I have to say Boy!! I was overjoyed after watching this start-to-finish thrill-ride and adrenaline rush offering!! It was not the kind of action-packed race flick where several pieces of disjoint stories are juxtaposed together to basically justify and depict the action and thrill itself, or in other words a messy story, but I had the genuine feeling that the story was well-knit and well-aligned with the amazing action and it had some substance which probably was lacking in previous movies. Especially now as we basically see law-breakers Vs law-enforcers and the boundaries are distinct and somewhat clearly defined, so almost the whole movie gave a feeling of Jason Bourne thrill, so one can imagine that here the story isn't compromised as one would expect before watching the movie----In the end, basically a very very good and thrilling cinematic experience and a valuable addition to the franchise itself. Even if you are like me, I mean, not a fan of racing flicks, this one would certainly force you to change your perspective quite a bit I can guarantee. Thanks!",observer85,4/29/11,2011
506,5,The best in the series since the first,"I remember seeing the first one and being wowed by it. I was just a kid, so of course it was something for me. I was 10 and saw it with a few friends and loved it. However I can't recall being impressed with a single sequel since then. Especially the puke fest that was ""Tokyo Drift"". 2 Fast was boring as hell and FAF seemed very slow and unfocused.

So I didn't expect much from this movie... and all I can say is WOW.

This movie was actually not bad for once. I can't believe for the first time I am able to say I enjoyed a TFATF sequel.

The plot isn't anything original or groundbreaking- but the movie is well aware of it, and just piled on the action. That said, even the unoriginality was entertaining- the setting of Rio, a mob boss' money, the robbery of the money, etc.

The action is intense and involving- I hated the shaky camera and quick cutting in movies 2-4, so this was much needed. Furthermore, the finale, where two cars transport a bank vault (not ridiculous enough for you?) was incredibly fun, as was the shootout and roof-jumping scene.

The humour was evident- the script was like Aaron Sorkin wrote an action movie. I loved the scene where the bomb goes off in the toilet pipes, causing a rain of poop in all the stalls, as was the police car racing scene, etc. Great balance of humour and action.

The cast was great too- Vin was his usual cool self, but gotta say, Tyrese Gibson stole the show!!! I loved how he said ""Say What?"" at every impossible situation. The Rock was fantastic as well- I was looking forward to seeing him in it, and he did a fantastic job.

My one complaint was that the movie was a smidge too long- maybe 10 minutes should have been trimmed, but ah, what the hell I had fun.

You know what... give the crew a cookie, they did a good job with this movie, they made it fun and entertaining, and therefore even if you hate the franchise, it's still good as a standalone movie. Definitely a solid start to the summer movie season!",Meven_Stoffat,5/2/11,2011
507,8,Fast Five shows that the series still has some NOS left in the engine,"The Fast and the Furious series returns for its fifth installment and largest cast to date. Paul Walker and Vin Diesel return to do another job this time on the run from the FBI(led by Dwayne Johnson as DSS agent Hobbs) and the Rio De Janeiro mafia. To pull off the ""one last job"" they assemble a team of professionals(all from previous films) including Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto,Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pearce, Ludicrous as Tej Parker,Sung Kang as Han Lue, and Matt Schulze as Vince. The movie is supposed to be filled with plenty of action involving cars, explosion, and woman, but can the all-star cast of actors make this an entertaining action movie or should the Fast and Furious series ended 2 sequels ago?Check out the rest on my film blog http://mastersfilmreview.wordpress.com/2011/05/02/fast-five-review/",bigcalkenobi,5/7/11,2011
513,10,This sequel was just AWESOME.,"This sequel was just AWESOME. It was the best amongst the others. I loved the ending, totally unexpected. Also, the part after the end credits was a total shocker. I would not mention what happens over here, but, for the people who haven't watched the movie as yet, DO NOT miss the part after the end credits. It was a jaw-dropping moment. It is totally WORTH the wait. I can watch Fast Five over and over again. It was brilliantly produced, directed and shot. Hats off to all the actors in the film. The best part being, all of them re-united from all the sequels. Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson, are two superb and outstanding actors. Paul Walker is just oh-so-hot, always will be. Jordana Brewster's performance in the film is impeccable. Can't wait for the next sequel. Gal Gadot looked very, very pretty in the movie. She is a fantastic actress. The particular scene after the end credits, actually left me surprised. I had goosebumps. Ah, anyway, this movie is a MUST watch. Enjoy it.",neha_rj,5/9/11,2011
515,9,Excellent F&F,"The action was awesome, the cars were incredible, and it had a great storyline! There was character development. There were twists. There was some predictably, but that is to be expected. However, I don't think anyone saw the awesome twist at the end! I also really liked the falling action after the climax.Most of the characters from the other movies were in here and played important roles. There was even a new big character. And of course the ending was awesome, while still leaving an opening for a sequel.Especially if you are a ""car guy"", you have to see this movie.",sabretooth91,5/16/11,2011
518,9,Gotta see that again!,"WOW... What a movie, Vin and Walker were at there best. You had top of the line action, also the joining of previous characters was awesome. To be honest this movie is very different from the last 4 that have been made. It makes more sense and it is worth it to go see this movie. Hell I wanna see it again it was so good. 5 out of 5 for this fifth installment of fast and furious. Go see this movie, it will be one hell of a ride! The Rock and Vin Diesel really go at it through out the movie, and the cast from the previous movies really bring back that feeling, like your getting back together after so long. It really will make you wanna see it again!!",harrytasker16,4/30/11,2011
519,4,Or am I a patriot or the movie is ridiculous,"It's strange for me to see that the majority opinion says that this is the best film in the series. Many people here in Brazil loved the movie as much as the series, but most agree that this was one of the worst, if not the worst. I liked the movie very much because he races cars and dizzying display of fantastic things involving cars and action.

For me, the best part of the film disappeared. The story did not make any sense, it might make for the rest of the world who have a vision of Brazil in which criminals natives would lower their weapons to a bunch of strangers, but this will only in this fantasy film. The reality is very different, even though there are a lot of crime and violence here.

Here we do not make movies with multimillion-dollar investments and no evidence of action worthy of a prize, but do not ridicule other countries with a view and that kind of history, a plot as mediocre. I expected a lot more to do justice to the name ""Fast and Furious"", and not just another action movie with explosions and gunfire scenes, among other things. The action scenes are really very good, exciting from start to finish but totally entertaining.",erryone,5/30/11,2011
522,3,Furios I am how bad this movie is,"I must ask was Vin Diesel on some kind of drugs while he was filming this? Seriously, every time he appeared on screen he looked like he could use a nap. Maybe he realized how bad this is and did not want to give an effort.I enjoyed 1 and 2nd FnF and did not watch rest of them except this last one.Except for few funny scenes and Dwayne Johnson rest is plain crap. Nothing is consistent. Pretty much like Transformers 3. You simply jump from one scene in no particular order and that is annoyance.Supporting cast is completely obnoxious and that was not easy to achieve.Don't bother to watch as I can not with describing how bad it is any longer.",carvercape,8/22/11,2011
523,5,I may have enjoyed it more if I understood it one bit.,"Paul Walker and Vin Deisel are back for yet another Fast and the furious film, Fast Five. Fast Five, in my opinion, will only appeal to those who love the series, and rednecks who love cars. Recently, I've been noticing a pattern in action films: After a while, the action sequences drag on for so long that you lose track of the plot. In Fast five, I was lost within 15 minutes, and the rest of the way.

So, this is what I got out of the plot: Vince and Mia(Paul Walker and Jordanna Brewster) have to break Dom(Vin Deisel) out of jail. I forgot why he was in there because the last film was a blur. Once that happens, they stay in Rio and there's something to do with a heist and a ton of other stuff.

I've seen four of these films, and would say that this one is one of the better ones. Director Justin Lin is talented with the action sequences, I just wish that he could go deeper into the plot. There are a lot of characters, such as a sympathetic cop and some politician villain or something, I don't know.

Dwayne Johnson(I still call him The Rock but whatever, he's bigger than that now I guess) gives a dreadful performance as one of the cops on their tail. I have known for a long time about how bad of an actor he is, and he proves it here.

So, I didn't exactly like it, but that doesn't mean you won't. I'm sure that the film will appear to others, but i'm different from everyone else. I like a little story to follow, I like mind benders that explain themselves. Not a car movie that goes too fast.",Christian_Dimartino,7/17/11,2011
525,5,Just another action movie,"Why does this even have to be a fast & furious sequel..

I thought the story of the fast and furious movies revolved around drags and races. This movie did have a drag with the cop cars which was unnecessary given their situation.

Does anyone remember how cool the cars & drags were back in the original. I remember each and every model of the cars used in the movie. Or how cool it was see them push the NOS button to go faster. Or how cool the entire soundtrack of the movie was. It's one of those movies that no matter how many times you saw you could never get bored of.

This movie just doesn't do that. Its one of those mindless action movies where you keep your brains in your car before you enter the theatre to preserve it in the same condition. Even though the action sequences in the movie are shown well, they are too far fetched and totally unrealistic.

I felt the damage done to the city at the end was far greater than the cash they steal, for which they need to take a sequel to hunt them down where ever in the world they might have escaped to, to pay for all the damage done.

But what i love is the moral of the story at the end. ""If you have the money, always go in for a European sports car"" :)",rashvind,6/25/11,2011
528,5,If Only they Shutup and Blow Something Up,Fast Five has been getting great reviews and is the first positive received film in the series. It's still another mediocre entry.I must admit that I have not seen all the The Fast and Furious films and I don't really care if I ever do. I decided to see this one and there be it. The movie begins show us Dom (Vin Diesel) is being sentenced to a long time in jail. We later see Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster helping him get free. Then they are on the run and they decide to get a job that the pay is real good. After doing the dangerous job they found out a very important dangerous man is behind the scenes. Then they call the whole crew back to do a big final score. Numerous actors from the series comes in and they show the process of them preparing for the score. At the same time a task force is sent to get Dom and his crew. Which is The Rock's character plays we get to see scenes of that.Let me get it out of the way the film's action sequences are made very well and they do provide the thrills for a movie like this. You can also see the movie drops the glorification of street racing even if it is dangerous. The problem with the film is it's pace and it's heavy nonsense dialogue. It was nothing interesting to say and I didn't really care much about it either. There was comic relief and trust me hot girls and sick ass cars. What bogs the film down is the pace and the dialogue. I do admit the last 30 mins of the film was truly exciting and fun if only the movie was like that the entire time.Sorry wasn't very convincing.MP **/* 2.5/5,migperez,5/15/11,2011
529,3,Not up the Expectations,"I must say ""disappointed"".Never was like any of the previous F&F movie. Too much drama made this film look like an average, over budgeted, nonsense action, lot of unwanted CGI and load of crap. It is so ridiculous with such a huge vault is being dragged own by two cars and able to bring down buildings, cars everything on its way and without any single twist to the ropes from two cars.Script is so bad, characters lack the depth, there is no proper story at all. Many actors did not have proper role to play example Elsa Pataki, Sung kang, Gal Gadot and Tyrese .

This is the 5th instalment of a franchise where you know what to expect - a lot of car action as well as plenty of gun-toting, foot chasing and one-on-one brawling; on which it delivers, overwhelmingly so, to the point that your head will be spinning by the end of it all.",slavewire,9/25/11,2011

However as Agent O'Conner and Dom are each investigating the crimes their paths continue to cross and soon it is obvious that Fenix (Laz Alonzo) is behind the crimes. Fenix works for a drug dealer named Arturo Braga (John Ortiz). Each of the men wants Braga for his own personal reasons. The film takes the viewer on exciting car chases through the Mexican desert, underground tunnels, and through the streets of LA. Each of these scenes is made more realistic by the camera angles. One such scene appears as the drug running team is racing across the Mexican desert towards mountains. At first, it looks as if the cars might smash into the side of the mountain but at the last minute, the camera angle exposes an opening. The theme of this film may seem hard to locate under all the action but it is an old-fashioned one. Nothing is more important than family and good friends are. Families come in many forms some of directly related and others are chosen. The police to the ending of the film demonstrate this throughout the film from the first time Dom leaves his girlfriend and crew in hopes of avoiding their capture. Dialogue is the main factor used to demonstrate the theme. A good example of this towards the end of the film Brian is seriously hurt and even though the police are coming Dom stays behind to make sure Brian is safe by saying ""he's tired of running"". The theme is again repeated at the end of the film when Brian returns the favor however to describe the scene or dialogue would ruin the end of this fast paced film. Although many viewers will only see the fast cars, action packed scenes, and violence the underlying fact of the film is families are the most important things.",jemai02,9/16/11,2011
532,8,Mindless fun,"What can someone expect from the 5th ""sequel"", after not watching first four? Probably something bad, milked to the bone and totally dry. Well, this is not the case here. I'll probably watch all the ""prequels"" backwards, just for a different perspective. This movie is fun and a huge slaughterhouse for the automobiles. Reminds me of The Wild Bunch only because of the ""body count"", only here ""poor"" cars prevail in the pile. The movie is very watchable, dynamic, action packed and (despite many obvious flaws in the plot) just OK. In these type of films directing and editing (beside special effects) is what counts and that part of the job is well done. The only time when I actually mentioned someone ""acting"" is when Dwayne Johnson pops up. That man, bearing his muscles as more of a curse in life than a blessing, is highly underestimated as an actor (watch Faster and you'll see what I mean). Others just pass through the scenes not even trying to do anything but to have fun themselves. If you have approx. 130 minutes surplus for some passive entertainment, go and watch this one. Don't expect. Just enjoy the ride.",Maleplatypus,8/26/11,2011
533,8,Ocean's 11 meets F&F,"Overall, this film is another entertaining chapter in the F&F franchise. I enjoyed it, but less than than its immediate predecessor. Where this movie falls short for me is in the ensemble cast aspect. It seems like the production company tried to stretch this episode against the canvas of an ""Ocean's 11"" type story (big cast, ""switcheroo"" plot), and as a result only a couple of the peripheral characters get to stand out and actually mean something to the story or the audience. Most noticeably, Elsa Pataky (as Officer Elena Neves) and Gal Gadot (returning as Gisele Harabo from Fast & Furious) assume roles on opposite sides of the law - but any roundness that could be lent to their characters seems lost in a cast that is way too large. The two actresses are similar enough in appearance that, as a result, I had to really struggle to find context to know which character was on screen at any given time. Dwayne Johnson steps in and provides a ""larger than life"" tough guy whose character is somewhat predictable. Via teaser information revealed in a scene at the end of the credits, the story ends up serving to largely be an intricate set up for the next movie. I guess it depends on the story line and how they plan to accommodate the passage of time, but it seems that they would be best served by completing this next chapter sooner rather than later - everyone is getting older and as the youthful element drains from the production, the concept starts to look even sillier than it started out to be.",dst-thomas,11/3/11,2011
534,8,Does what it sets out to do,"The original ""The Fast and Furious"" was exactly that, fast furious, silly and laser focused on it's young male target market.The law of diminishing quality applied to the sequels, if not box office but this fifth installment has well and truly bucked the trend. This latest offering reuniting many of the original cast but also dragging in the ""The Rock"" to really drive home the message, this is a more substantial film.We still get the obligatory coupe of scenes with flash cars, models with painted on outfits and the whole project exudes testosterone from every pore. There is however more heart here, it does mean something, not much but there is a heist story in there holding the whole premise together.Paul Walker and Van Diesel reprise their roles, clearly finding work outside the franchise not as lucrative or productive as they had hoped. There is a lot of gunplay and the body count is high but in keeping with the certificate, everyone dies very cleanly with little gore on display, an A-Team for the new generation.This time we are firmly based in South America, Rio Janeiro amongst the Fave-la's, read very poor areas, where filming must have been difficult with the crowds that must have accumulated. We have lots of running over roofs, jumps and great helicopter shots, that would presumably would have been impossible in a more risk averse and libelous urban setting.Following a spectacular ""break out"", which in reality no-one would have survived, we start with Brian O'Conner (Walker) and girlfriend Mia Toretta (Jordana Brewster) at a low ebb. They are in Rio on the run, visiting their old friend Vince (Matt Schulze), for a bit of a feed and the possibility of another job, as funds are definitely low.The job on offer involves boosting high end cars from a moving train, an action sequence which is very impressive, in a ""looks like somebody is actually doing most of this"", kind of way. It is preposterous of course but if you want real life drama and social commentary, anything with Fast and Furious in the title will not be high on your list.The rather dubious moral aspects of stealing stuff and getting rich quick are certainly not explored, nobody has a real job and as always, driving cars really fast in dangerous situations, is always completely safe and fun.Once the cars are obtained with Dominic Toretta's help (Diesel), the old gang is assembled as they realize they have stumbled onto something bigger, involving the obligatory king drug lord Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). We know he is an overlord as he kills an underling in off hand manner, sometimes it would be good to see a drug lord forgive a minion for a minor infraction, at least it would be something new.The gang come to the attention of the elite US Diplomatic Security Service (USS) backed squad led by Luke Hobbs (The Rock, Dwayne Johnson). This group act as police, judge and jury, seemingly wasting bad guys at will with apparent impunity. They are aided by the very pretty but initially mousey widow (Elsa Pataky) of the only apparently honest policeman in Rio.The assembled gang get little to do, apart from add legitimacy to the reinvented franchise, although Tyrese Gibson gets some good lines and comedy is ably provided by Tego and Don.The closing sequence is probably at 13 on a scale of 10 for believability but certainly will have stimulated the South American car industry with the number of cars destroyed.Diesel and the Rock dispense with any pretense of acting and just bulge muscles, fight at length and look macho, occasionally all at the same time. There are some unintentional laugh out loud moments but Paul Walker does slip in a few quiet moments of real acting when the crew and director were off planning the next stunt.Summary Does what it sets out to do but at least with a little more style and substance than the last three entries.Will not be troubling Oscar but with top notch ""real"" stunts and a stronger plot, this shows the franchise may have more in the tank yet for those who like their action Fast, Furious and a bit daft.",julian-mumford,10/21/11,2011
535,8,I love this effing movie!,"It was loud. It was fast. Cars raced and crashed. They shot people. People fell in love.Every man in this movie is so sexy I could hardly breathe. Don't worry fellas, there's lot of eye candy for you too.Plot? What plot. There's kind of a plot but who gives a damn. Let's be loud, fast, race cars, crash them and ratchet up the tension with an impossible heist for tons of money involving murderous drug dealers (Long live Bucho! still got mad swag after all these years) and corrupt cops.It even had an ""after the credits twist"" that left my eyes stinging with surprised tears.I love this movie!",cristalshandalear,10/9/11,2011
536,8,"Everything about this movie says ""terrible"", but I still had a great time watching.","SUMMER. IS. HERE. I am so happy because these are the best movies of the year. I gagged and giggled a little while typing that out whatever, I am an eternal summer flick sucker. The only thing better than seeing a summer flick is seeing one at midnight. Sadly, no midnight movies in Maine

On to the veggies: Fast Five or Fast and the Furious Five or FF or FFF. I was not a fan of these movies until a the last one came out. Not really not a fan, but I just had never watched them. Big mistake on my part. To date, this has been one of the most entertaining series of films other than the Delta Force movies. I was so excited about this movie for three reasons:

1) THE ROCK. The star studded (?) cast of FFF could only be improved by adding Dwayne THE ROCK Johnson. He has beefed up and has that strangely sweaty chin-hair, but still won't go by THE ROCK. Maybe when he gets back to wrestling here shortly. I suspect he brought his own writer over from WWE (WWF, I don't follow FAKE wrestling) since his line were some of the stupidest one-liners I have ever heard. I've seen Arthur and Your Highness and I laughed more at FFF than both those movies. ROCK was not the only culprit – the rest of the cast had absurd dialog that matched the over-the-top action.

2) Speaking of THE ACTION!! Fast and Furious = hot people racing cars. Huuuuuge letdown in this department. Racing on straight streets, total CGI racing action, and (this made me mad) skipping over the only real street racing scene in the entire movie. I could go on about the physics of towing a 10 ton bank with two muscle cars – coefficient of friction and all – but the internet has that covered.

3) Seeing movies with my friend QUEER. That's right, we live over 1000 miles away, but we got to see FFF in the same theater. We laughed. We laughed some more. We complained. We got drinks at the gay bar. Queer is responsible for my terrible movie tastes and love of movies in general. No better way to see a film.

Fifth in the series is always iffy. Everything about this movie says ""terrible"", but I still had a great time watching. Not to spoil anything, but it looks like we might have a few more movies. Hopefully Vin Diesel will stick with the series until his wattle is wrinkled and dangling.",FatMan-QaTFM,8/24/11,2011
537,8,Camaraderie,"The title for this ongoing sequel to Fast and Furious is, it seems, related to the number of films based on this fast driving bunch of car fanatics than to the number of people in the tribe. What makes this series of Pow and Wow action flicks stand above many of its competitors is the tremendous sense of fun the cast seems to be having - leaping over rooftops, driving fast cars, pulling off impossible heists. It all ends in a sense of fun and introduces the teaser for the next in the series (a bit with Eva Mendes and Jason Mignot in a brief talk after the credits run pretty much guarantees the next installment).This time the guys and girls - Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel), his sister Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster), her boyfriend ex-cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), Vince (Matt Schulze), Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson), Tej Parker (Ludacris), Han Lue (Sung Kang), Gisele Harabo (Gal Gadot) Tego Leo (Tego Calderon), and Rico Santos (Don Omar) - gather in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - each in various stages of running from the past - hunted by FBI Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and in desperate need for money to escape Rio to countries where they cannot be extradited. They discover the one last job opportunity - taking away the money that billionaire Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) takes from the money houses in the infamous Rio favelas district. It takes the talent of the entire crew to make the heist of heists as the safe where the illegal money is kept is in the police station in a huge vault that is impenetrable - until our gang takes over in likely the most interesting and entertaining chase scene on film. The rest of the story is fluff but nice - with a little love interest thrown in for good measure. This cast is strong and they pull of the fine line between comedy and drama very well. In the end this is a fast and entertaining escape film. And #6 will probably come soon! Grady Harp",gradyharp,10/6/11,2011
538,8,my review,Fast Five was awesome! The cars were faster and they fled from the united states to Brazil. The gang reunited to pull a job and steal the drug lord money that he had in a vault at the police station in Brazil.The surprise moment that Mia is pregnant and there is a continuation from this movie. I was surprised that the FBI helped the gang get the Brazilian drug lords money. I cant wait till the next movie comes out and also I want a fast car like the fast five movies.I like to work on cars and take them apart and start from scratch. Every time i get a nice car i always like to fix it up like in the Fast & Furious movies.,oscarhoyos07,10/2/11,2011
539,8,"Guilty pleasure, the plot and action are absurd but it is fun to watch them.","The action begins with a bold heist, a bus carrying dangerous criminals to another prison. The target is to bust out Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto. The man behind the plan is his buddy, Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner. Where to go, to avoid capture? How about Rio De Janiero? That is where most of the rest of the movie is set.

But the USA doesn't forgive criminals and heists very easily, and their best man, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as Luke Hobbs, who brings along his best team, arrive to capture the criminals.

That wouldn't generate much in the way of an interesting story, were it not for the third leg of the criminal triangle, a local drug and crime boss. So much of the action and intrigue ends up with both Toretto's group and Hobbs' group getting the best of the crime boss and his gang.

The action is ""over the top"", with the shooting and car chases. Of particular mention is the theft of the large bank safe containing crime money (the local police were allies) , by pulling it through busy streets and freeways with cables tied to two cars. Maneuver those correctly and the large safe is an effective battering ram.

But most fun for me was seeing the two tough-guy actors, Diesel and Johnson, go at each other.

SPOILERS: After they got the best of the crooks, and managed to open the safe, it was empty. Toretto's gang managed to pull a switch during the chase and the safe full of $$Millions was in their possession. From mutual respect, Hobbs gave Toretto a head start before resuming his mission to capture him. Which sets up nicely for the next sequel.",TxMike,11/13/11,2011
540,8,Popcorn Fun,"I went with a certain amount of trepidation, but I came out of this movie impressed with action. Sure, the plot is below average and the dialogue is laughable but I really didn't expect either to be good. The refreshing thing is that there is real dialogue, forced but real and they punched up the fun all the way through. Bottom line - see this because it is a fun action movie with enough cars and fun to make the popcorn go down easy. It may not keep you on the edge of your seat but it doesn't have to for the most part.If you see this with the kind of low expectations that I had (heck, even if you're greatly anticipating this thing), I'm willing to bet (since I bet on everything) that you'll enjoy it.",krieg8814254,6/13/11,2011
542,8,More than just a car chase plus the Rock helps,There is more story here than in the previous instalments. Combine that with an exotic setting in Rio and a stunning car chase climax it's well worth watching. Not just about car chases anymore. There is a daring break in. The Rock provides quite a good addition. His scenes with Vin Diesel is quite memorable. Couple of minus points: the way they portrayed parts of Rio as a gun infested slum must not be the image Rio is hoping to promote for the 2016. There could have been more attractive settings. Bit too sexist use of the ladies too. Overall enjoyable and a bit more far ranging than the last few.,phd_travel,11/6/11,2011
544,8,"Still drifting away from car porn, still provides a nice heist.","I fully admit that I have a love affair with this series of misadventures that focus heavily on the beauty of fast cars. While it's only the original The Fast and The Furious that is the lone solid entry in the franchise, that doesn't lessen much how giddy I got enjoying just how silly things got in the ridiculously titled 2 Fast 2 Furious. Then, a detour to Japan for the third film Tokyo Drift. Most don't think very much of that one, where Dom only is featured for a moment and the kind of racing is more than a little queer.

It really wasn't until Fast and Furious, the sadly subtitle or numberless flick from 2009 I found myself not as pleased with what was being done with these various collection of meat heads and grease monkeys. Slowly the movies were focusing less on the culture of street racing and more toward generic chase action films.

Sadly that degeneration has come to a full head here in Fast Five. Call it Oceans Eleven with a hotter, if less talented, cast of actors. Yes, the gang is all here. Even Han who was introduced and killed in Tokyo Drift which apparently hasn't happened yet in the timeline of the films. Yeah, bitches technically 4 and 5 are prequels to 3 and yet sequels to 1 and 2. And if that isn't redonkulous enough, we now have intertwined The Rock into these things. He steals the show here, with the action heating up in Rio where there are not only plenty of angry birds, but plenty of cops and robbers heisting to be done by Dom and his crew that also includes Luda, Tyrese, a nameless woman, and a pair of unique locals that I'm fairly certain are life partners.

Replacing the street racing culture — quite literally, since just when the film's scattershot script decides to go there, the scene is cut — there is a boring idea of ganking a drug lord's bank vault. The fact it's hidden by the corrupt police is just a great excuse to have all the confusion action as white-knuckle a thrill ride as possible.

Most of the acting is worse than ever, but there are several set pieces that work really bigger and better than ever. And as much as I'd totally would love to slag on just how bad a Fast Five should be, it's just a lot of hyperactive FUN! FUN! FUN! So basically even though I'm not fond of the choice to change the core of what these films are about, they still bring a lot of what I want: Over the top stunts with easy-going characters that say dumb things like: ""Give me the veggies."" and ""You know what this is? I'll tell you what this is."" Along with overheated testosterone fights.",Queer-qatfm,8/28/11,2011
546,8,"Easily the best of the series and very fun and exciting to watch. Not many car racing scenes, which I liked. I say B+","""The guys we're after are professional runners. They like speed and are guaranteed to go down the hardest possible way so make sure you've got your funderwear on. We find 'em we take 'em as a team and we bring 'em back. And above all else we don't ever, ever let them get into cars."" After breaking Dominic (Diesel) out of the jail bus Brian and him move to Rio to start a new life of robbing and stealing. After Brian gets news that makes him want to stop running the team decides to pull off one last heist. I have never been a real big fan of the series. They are good but have mostly been ""I have car...I go fast."" The fourth one was the best because it actually had a story to it. Then I saw this one. Far and away the best of the series so far. For those that watched them for the racing I should warn you, there is only one scene in this one. This one was more in the style of ""Oceans 11"" then a ""Fast & Furious"" movie. I'm not sure if the sixth one they are making is needed, but like all movies lately they will make them until they make one too many...then the remakes start. That reason aside this is a very fun and exciting heist movie very much worth watching. Overall, I surprisingly liked it a lot and highly recommend this. I give this a B+.Would I watch it again? - I think I would, I can't say that about the other four.*Also try - Fast & Furious 1-4 & Takers",cosmo_tiger,10/3/11,2011
547,8,"This is a fun, mindless action movie. If you enjoy this, you must see this!","This is a damn good action movie. You don't need to see all the other movies prior to seeing this, only the first one and the fourth one.It starts immediately after the last one ended. Dom played by Vin Diesel, Brian played by Paul Walker and Mia played by Jordana Brewster are hiding in Brazil, they do a job and they are being chased by a federal agent named Luke Hobbs played by Dwayne Johnson and a drug lord named Hernan Reyes played by Joaquim de Almedia. The plot is thin but it's still interesting, there is little more than planning for the next job or phase and a thin plot is better than no plot. No plot would just be running and gunning, talking and resting and maybe having sex once.The action is great, loud and mindless, if you only like realistic action movies, avoid this. Unlike the other movies, this isn't a racing movie, this is a heist movie with racing in it, similar to The Italian Job, I only seen the remake which was okay I guess. Some people hate the fact that the series has taken a new direction and it's understandable but I think taking new directions is a great way, probably the best way to make a series entertaining a while longer instead of allowing it to become boring. Slasher movies are the opposite of taking a new direction, still a slasher movie could be universally hated if aliens suddenly show up and the killer helps his victims kill the aliens.Why didn't I give this movie a perfect score? The plot is thin, there isn't much character development, Joaquim's character is bland, the acting is mediocre, and maybe the serious dialogue is bad, I haven't noticed any bad dialogue before seeing it but it may happen the next time I see it. Speaking of acting, Vin Diesel shows a little more emotion than usual and although Dwayne hasn't done that too, he still is entertaining and he's probably the best actor or performer in the movie. There is a short, surprising scene halfway through the credits, you really should see it.I had a lot of fun with this, it's too bad I seen it alone. The DVD is coming out on October 5, six months after it came out and I'm not sure if I'll get the DVD alone or the DVD/Blu Ray combo pack. I'm looking forward to Fast Six which comes out on May 2013 and hopefully that will be the last, six movies is enough.",ty-jensen,8/26/11,2011
548,8,"Wow!!!! So much better than the other films, justin lin really stepped it up a notch","It's been 10 years since The Fast and the Furious power-slid into theaters trailed by mixed reviews but an overwhelmingly positive reaction from fans. Future installments, especially 2 Fast 2 Furious‚Äã and Tokyo Drift‚Äã, were panned by critics but (in spite of mostly nonsensical plots and sub-par acting) the films continued to bring in big bucks for Universal -- delivering the same over-the-top action sequences grounded in illegal street-racing culture that fans had come to expect. Now, director Justin Lin is once again stepping behind the wheel of another Fast and Furious film (side note: he directed Tokyo Drift as well as Fast & Furious) with Fast Five. The film not only stars the fan-favorite pairing of Dominic Toretto‚Äã (Vin Diesel‚Äã) and Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker‚Äã), but also brings back a number of familiar faces from prior installments ‚Äì as well as introducing hell-hath-no-fury DSS agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) into the mix. However, saddled with so many personalities in one film, does Fast Five still deliver high-octane action and an engaging story? Fans of prior installments will be pleased to hear that Fast Five is probably the biggest and most over-the-top film in The Fast and Furious franchise. It's not likely to win over many audience members who didn't see any of the earlier films but, for anyone who likes muscle cars, beautiful women, and heist films, Fast Five delivers plenty of pulse-pounding moments.",funkymihir,8/23/11,2011
