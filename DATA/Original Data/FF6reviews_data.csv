8,"""This is vehicular warfare.""","I don't think many other franchises has been as turbulent and uneven as The Fast and the Furious films. Things started off pretty earnestly with Rob Cohen's first film, but quickly careened into odd directions, with the ever-cheesy 2 Fast 2 Furious taking off and running with one main character while leaving the other in the dust, and with Tokyo Drift drifting away with totally different characters altogether. Thankfully, Fast & Furious realigned the series with its roots. But it wasn't until Fast Five when I really began to give a darn about this series. Granted that all films have had their fun moments, the fifth film magically tied in every single strand from every single film, and made every single character relevant. Best of all, it did so with a great sense of fun: it had great pacing, amusing comedy, great action, and it made the characters stand out as a collectively outstanding cast.So now Fast & Furious 6 has come out, reuniting the entire gang once more to take on bigger stakes. The spectacle in this film tries its best to be even bigger, more absurd, and more awesome than before: the film is effectively book-ended with two massive action setpieces. The first involves a decently destructive car chase in London, where the villain effectively uses his custom-built ride to launch other cars all over the place. The film's final act features a really crazy sequence in which a tank roars across a highway, crushing other cars and blowing up bridges. This all culminates with all the muscle cars banding together to bring down a massive cargo plane in a fiery blaze of glory. In between, the film slows down a bit, but there's frequent fist-fights and pursuits, a few scenes of witty comedy, and there's one decent car-racing scene.Whether or not you really dig this film may depend on how well you dig the characters and all their dynamics. It definitely helps to watch and understand the events of the first five films, because at this point, they've all been through so much and changed so much; for a late-comer like me, who never was invested in the characters until the last film, it can be confusing to remember who was who and what their history was. Fortunately, the film does insert some flashbacks and reminders for the audience's benefit. If you are keeping up with things, then the film will reward you with a cast of endearing and heartfelt characters, and the film's plot generally revolves around their continuing struggles. As far as the actual plot goes, it's pretty brainless and absurd action-movie fodder, and there are plot holes to be found. However, the film does have the merit of presenting a cast of villains to directly oppose the cast of heroes, and the story pulls out a few surprising twists.The film generally looks good, but many of the action scenes are hectically shot and edited, and it can be hard to tell what's going on in certain scenes. What you can see is awesome, but sometimes, it's just aggravating. Acting is generally fun and enjoyable from the whole cast. Writing gets the job done well enough. This production uses a plethora of quality sets, props, and costumes, with loads of flashy cars at its disposal, and some okay-looking special effects. This film uses some cool hip rap and techno music, while the music score is pretty cool (sounds a lot like Brian Tyler's work from Tokyo Drift, which was one of my favorite soundtracks).Best recommended to fans of the series, especially if you've been following the last few movies.4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)",Al_The_Strange,"May 24, 2013"
8,A big movie and a fun time!,"Well, this was unexpected! Going into this film I found myself with no hype at all. I expected a good, fun and cheesy movie time and I came out of the theater happy and surprised. While this isn't a masterpiece of filmmaking it does achieve what it sets out to do. To entertain you. And it does this quite good and sometimes it goes further than this by showing us some amazing set pieces and action sequences. For example one car, tank chase sequence! This is achieved by the gigantic production value of the film. You can literally smell the money that comes out of these guys. The whole movie you have this sense of scale, and I mean BIG scale! The amazing sound mixing and design including the music pumps you up and puts you in the mood! While the acting isn't Oscar worthy it is very fluid and it doesn't always feel forced. The chemistry between the cast is very solid and credible. Diesel and ""The Rock"" where pretty solid along with the secondary characters, and the villain was surprisingly tolerable. Another thing that solidifies the movie are the effects. These are outstanding along with the camera-work! The things that brought the movie down for me a little bit where some of the stunts, and weirdly some of these I found pretty amazing but although I understand this movie isn't supposed to be taken seriously there were some stunts that were just plain unbelievable, specially in the third act of the movie. And finally, the plot. While not groundbreaking it did have its interesting points but it doesn't drift away from the cheese factors. Overall I was quite surprised by what this movie did and how the director and producers exploited and used their huge production value. This is an example of a good quality action flick.",pablo2896,"May 24, 2013"

No rating,Builds Upon The Winning Blockbuster Formula Of Fast Five.,"The sixth instalment in The Fast and the Furious franchise, Fast & Furious 6 follows into the footsteps of its predecessor and continues the series' new-found mantra of departing from its original street racing theme to move further into the heist thriller sub-genre. And even if it's not as refreshing & impressive as Fast Five, it nonetheless succeeds as another thrilling, ridiculously entertaining & undeniably fun extravaganza.The story of Fast & Furious 6 concerns Dominic Toretto & his crew, all of whom have retired to a comfortable life following the heist they pulled off in the previous chapter yet they still remain wanted fugitives in their homeland. But when Hobbs asks for their services to take down a skilled mercenary organisation in exchange for clearing their criminal records, Dom accepts the deal and reassembles his team to finish one last job.Directed by Justin Lin, Fast & Furious 6 is his final stint with this franchise and he decides to go out on a high note by delivering a picture that's far too enjoyable to worry about the laws of physics being bent here on few occasions. The screenplay packs in an interesting plot filled with excellent use of humour but it isn't as tightly gripped as the last instalment and is a slight step down in comparison. But a few elements do get an upgrade.The technical aspects follow the same formula that was applied in Fast Five and there isn't much to complain here for the set pieces look spectacularly detailed, the action sequences benefit a lot from its energetic camera-work, brilliant editing & more use of practical effects just like the last chapter although at times the action goes way too over-the-top yet not so exaggerated for most viewers to suspend disbelief. And the background score is fitting for the most part.Coming to the performances, the entire main cast that was present in the last one reprises its role, Michelle Rodrigues also returns to join the gang and Luke Evans is the new addition who plays this chapter's antagonist. Vin Diesel & Paul Walker do their usual best as Toretto & O'Conner, Dwayne Johnson continues to impress as Hobbs, However, Evans doesn't get enough screen time to show his mettle and his characters turns out to be a generic villain. The rest of the cast chips in with fine contributions.On an overall scale, Fast & Furious 6 builds upon the very ingredients that worked in favour of Fast Five and, barring a couple of issues, manages to stay on the track for the most part. Although not as amazing as the previous entry, this is nevertheless an immensely enjoyable blockbuster material that promises a lot of fun & thrills, and effectively delivers it. Definitely more style than substance although the margin isn't as vast as it had been in the first four chapters of this franchise, Fast & Furious 6 comes delightfully recommended.",CinemaClown,"Sep 4, 2015"
7,Movin' on up!,"While most franchises lose their steam with each succeeding sequel, the Fast and the Furious franchise is that rare exception where its later films breathe in new life into the series. Once a franchise about car racing, ""Fast Five"" took an unexpected turn as a bank heist thriller in the vein of Steven Soderbergh's ""Ocean's 11,"" a welcomed change as seen by its huge box office earnings and critical success. Now, ""Furious 6"" is neither about car racing nor bank heists, but rather a terrorist threat with obvious inspirations from ""The Dark Knight."" Like ""Fast Five,"" the results are immensely satisfying and undeniably entertaining.The key to the franchise's upward turn in quality is due to director Justin Lin. He is a skilled action director, and many filmmakers can learn a few things or two from him: The action sequences are impressive, engaging, comprehensible, and well-shot, with practical effects to boot. There is a sense of danger, verve, and life in these scenes rarely found in other films, despite how over-the-top and ridiculous they may be; and yes, they often drift into gratify-defying territory. While I usually don't react out loudly when watching a film, this film had me gasping, jaw dropping, laughing, and applauding, sometimes all at once!Another ingredient to the film's success is the chemistry between the cast members. We have grown to love these characters over the course of the series that one cannot help but cheer on for them. In particular, Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous have such a terrific rapport with each other that they provide some of the film's biggest laughs and memorable one-liners. Additionally, Luke Evans is definitely a step up above the previous film's antagonist, and Gina Carano provides some great ass-kicking moments, although not much performance-wise. On another note, I want to mention how refreshing it is to see minority actors fill these roles. Certainly, the film's use of a diverse ensemble cast should be commended. As for the story, it's nothing special, but I dare you not to act surprised when several plot twists are revealed; I did so more than I would like to admit.If there's one thing to learn about this franchise, it's that some change can be a good thing. While the later sequels do focus away from the car racing, they still featured cars, which helped retain old fans while bringing in new ones. ""Furious 6"" is terrific entertainment, and judging by yet another dazzling cliffhanger and the audience's reaction, ""Fast & Furious 7"" will be an amazing finale for the series. Unfortunately, Justin Lin won't be back around for the last installment, but someone please get this man to direct every and all upcoming action flicks.",moviewizguy,"May 16, 2013"
6,"A whole new stratosphere of action, ""F&F6"" will start to separate the junkies from those who need substance","Bigger, faster, crazier — that's the motto of the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise six films in. If you thought the action, scale and stunts were off the charts in ""Fast Five,"" prepare to have your mind blown by ""Fast & Furious 6."" The previous films were an acceleration, and the series hit full throttle with ""Fast Five."" The road was open and endless for Universal, and returning writer Chris Morgan and director Justin Lin. What they opt to do in ""F&F6"" is bend the limits of reality to their will. From the initial London chase to a highway tank sequence to the grand finale, which involves a massive cargo plane, this is an action movie jacked up on steroids. In fact, there are a couple references to Marvel ""Avengers"" characters — a not-so-subliminal suggestion that Universal would like you to think of Dominic Toretto's crew/family as a team of superheroes.The trouble is for every ""wow!"" moment there are twice the number of ""what?"" moments. The action is so ludicrous that you lose all sense of what's happening. They're like little blackout moments as you drink more and more of the movie's high-octane Kool-Aid.Morgan pulls together a perfectly viable plot. Dom's (Vin Diesel) presumed deceased former lover, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) has been spotted in association with a criminal mastermind named Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) whose ex-military crew is essentially the shadow image of our heroes. Dobbs (Dwayne Johnson) presents this info to Dom in hopes that it'll persuade Dom into doing him favor in taking Shaw down. It naturally works, and the crew must put a hiatus on their quiet life spending all the cash they stole in the last film; when the patriarch of the family calls, you answer.The movie doubles down on the notion of the crew as family. Shaw is supposed to be the antithesis. He doesn't care about allegiances but about precision and planning. He's cold and calculated, whereas the ""family"" is warm and spontaneous. It's cliché, but at least time is spent on the characters. There is only one newbie in former MMA fighter Gina Carano as Hobbs' new right hand, meaning the character time is invested in the existing characters, which is good, though the script doesn't pierce beyond the surface traits we're already familiar with.It also bears mentioning that at one point the script reveals a twist that's solely for the purpose of a twist. This ""surprise"" makes no sense and has no actual bearing on what happens in the film. Morgan wanted a surprise moment to keep things interesting and it's a nice moment — but then you realize it's actually meaningless and changes nothing. Another example of how flash without substance is the M.O. of this series. You have to like flash for the sake of flash to be a big fan.Of course any scene in which an engine of any kind is not running only matters so much in these films, but ""Fast & Furious 6"" will start to really separate out the pure action junkies who've been hooked on this series from those who prefer some plausibility and gravity —literally and figuratively — in their blockbusters. Lin's sensibilities would probably be of more use in a sci-fi or fantasy movie where he could break all laws of common sense and completely get away with it. In this movie, depending on your taste, it will either get you stoked or spoil the moment.One could argue that this franchise has found a niche in larger-than-life action movies — that there's a viable space for films that maintain the trappings of the real world but play by the rules of a superhero movie. That's fair, but in many ways by blowing the ceiling off what's possible, they've created another ceiling. If anything is possible, at some point we will no longer be surprised by the impossible. The films would be better served by maintaining some thread of connection to the laws of physics, then when they broke them a little, it would have a bigger impact. ""Fast Five"" did this well and it's a shame this movie takes such a tremendous leap in believability.Nevertheless, there's an undeniable adrenaline rush that comes with Lin's style of direction and the size and stature of the stunts and action sequences. It's three-fold true in this entry. That's the kind of thrill that maintains a sufficient baseline for enjoying these moves.~Steven CThanks for reading!

7,"As if a Tank wasn't enough, they got a Plane too","Fast & Furious over the last few installments has become all about action. And the latest outing takes it a step further. Almost 20% of the movie is comprised of action sequences. And at the expense of action, plot, writing, characters all take a backseat. But no one's complaining. Why ? Because the action makes up for all of it.Do the above statements sound cliché ??? The movie's plot is full of such silly dialogs so its best ignored in the current context. What works is the action - Lin and his crew bring us some of the most ridiculously outrageous and boldly conceived action sequences. There's an intense chase through London in the initial reels and also a race later on. There's a whole plane take-off-crash sequence towards the end that you've probably got a glimpse of in the trailers. The girls are no slouches either and we see an intense hand-to-hand fight of sorts between Michelle Rodriguez's Letty and Gina Carano's Riley.But the movie's best sequence is undoubtedly the 10 minute Tank chase across the freeway that involves most of the cast and culminates in a breathtaking ""catch"" (about which I'd not say any further). The camera cuts like crazy, music is pulsating and that single sequence is probably worth the price of the movie ticket.Apart from action, Furious 6 doesn't have much going for it. Dialog is standard, at times even silly and predictable, characters are flat, performances are decent. The car chases and night scenes got me so involved, I actually felt a bit strange leaving the theater and coming out into the real world's broad daylight. And the post-credits scene is simply, a treat which makes the next installment in the series worth looking forward to. Suffice it to say that in the end, the movie drifts full circle.Watch it for the action, and for the action alone. If you expect any sort of character development or family issues like the first installment had, you'll be disappointed. Else, you're in for one hell of a ride.Score: 7 / 10",KrazzyDJ,"May 26, 2013"
10,Fast & Furious 6 is The best film in the franchise that I love to Death!,"Fast & Furious 6 (2013) is the best of the best Action film in the series franchise! It's Justin Lin's Masterpiece and I love it to death. Sorry but is not Fast Five and Furious 7 the best, but is Fast & Furious 6 the best one in the franchise! This my favorite best film of the franchise that I just love to death! The film has great cast and great action, great dialogue! It is the last time that Paul Walker starts in this film. In Furious 7 was his brother who was portraying Brian O'Conner with a fake CGI. In here Paul Walker is real, Justin Lin started a great franchise which ended in this film.Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson reunite for this sixth installment in the 'Fast and Furious' action thriller franchise, directed by Justin Lin. After their lucrative Rio heist, and unable to return home, Dom (Vin Diesel) and the rest of his compatriots are forced to kill time lying low in different locations around the world. When DSS agent Hobbs offers Dom and his crew full pardons in return for taking down Owen Shaw (Luke Evans)'s gang of mercenary drivers, the offer seems too good to pass. But as the rivals head for a showdown on the streets of London, Dom learns that Shaw's second-in-command is none other than his presumed dead former lover, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez).I love This film to death! This film is about rescuing Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and stopping a brilliant mastermind terrorist hijacker Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) and his team of hijackers.Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson and Michelle Rodriguez lead a cast of returning all-stars as the global blockbuster franchise built on speed delivers the biggest adrenaline rush yet in this explosive Action Film. Hobbs (Johnson) has been tracking an organization of lethally skilled drivers, whose mastermind (Luke Evans) is aided by the love Dom (Diesel) thought was dead, Letty (Rodriguez). The only way to stop the criminal mercenaries from stealing a top secret weapon is to outmatch them at street level, so Hobbs asks for the help of Dom and his elite team. Payment for the ultimate chase? Full pardons for all of them and a chance to make their families whole again.The ""Fast & Furious"" franchise has always been a personal favorite of mine. Sure, as a whole, they're fairly easy to pass off as mindless action films for film goers who want a good rush of big-budget Hollywood action, but I've mostly seen them as more of a chugging train of car movies that simply get better with each new installment, and that's no exception with ""Fast & Furious 6,"" which I'd probably say is the best addition to the series so far. I don't think I've been this thoroughly entertained by an action sequel in a while. The car chases and stunts are bigger, wilder, and more over-the-top than ever before, the characters' previously limited personalities continue to grow quite impressively, and the story manages to be both awesomely ridiculous and surprisingly engaging from start to finish (even though we all know which side is gonna come out victorious in the end). The action is glorious while it lasts, but then the film goes back to figuring out how to keep its over sized vessel from taking on water. And that's more hard work than it's worth.Still, the best thing about this flick is the character interaction, even with actors whose roles are this limited. Letty's amnesia adds an interesting soapy twist to the plot that forces Dom to constantly try to remind her why she loves him. Brian's fatherhood also lets Paul Walker do a bit of enjoyably self-serious acting of his own. Otherwise, Tyrese Gibson and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges are left with the snappy comedic relief, while Gina Carano, Gal Gadot, and Elas Pataky merely get to look feisty and hot in their action scenes (but at least they do a great job at it). As for Dwayne Johnson, he gives an unusually deadpan performance this time around, with only just a few outrageous outbursts of manly banter here and there. Nonetheless, the cast here is consistently entertaining, with the screenplay letting everyone get a chance to shine, even if some of them aren't quite as memorable as others. The script delivered an action moments with high explosions on an airplane that are not forgettable. I love that fight between Gina Carano & Michelle Rodriguez which it was tremendous. I love this film to death! I love this film to death, Fast & Furious 6 is the best! The battles on airplane are Epic! I consider it as Justin Lin's Masterpiece.",ivo-cobra8,"Oct 17, 2015"
6,Indeed a guy's movie...,"The faster the cars in this franchise seem to go, the more realism seems to go away with it. Sure, the action and car chases in ""Fast & Furious 6"" is breathtaking and spectacular, but the movie was just a tad over the top.I sat down to watch ""Fast & Furious 6"" simply because I had the opportunity, and because I wanted to watch it because of Michelle Rodriguez. I can't say that I had any particular hopes or expectations to this movie, nor can I claim that it was a movie release that I was in any way looking forward to.If you have seen any of the previous five movies then you know exactly what you will get here. There is nothing much new to be had here, it is essentially the same. However, that being said, then the movie is enjoyable, entertaining and fast-paced.This sixth installment to the franchise brings the return of an assumed dead member of the Toretto 'family' and it also brings the departure of one. The returning member is, of course, Letty. I am not going to reveal who will be departing - you'll just have to watch the movie for yourself and find out.As entertaining as the action was in the movie, then the last whole segment was a bit too much. I mean, a car bring down a massive Russian cargo airplane? That was just too much. And how long does it take for a plane of that size to get enough speed to become airborne? It just took forever. And speaking of forever, then that tarmac runway had to be the longest in the world - it just went on and on.As with the previous movies, then it is a great ensemble of actors and actresses, and it is as always a joy to have them returning to their parts, and there is a great chemistry between the various characters. I was especially thrilled to see Joe Taslim (playing Jah) in the movie; he did a great job in ""The Raid: Redemption"" and its great to see him make it into American cinema as well. He is definitely a guy to keep an eye on in the future.""Fast & Furious 6"" is, as the previous five movies, a guy's movie - full of adrenaline, muscle cars, car chases, macho guys and testosterone dripping off everywhere. The story was enjoyable, even with the part that went off the scale. And if you enjoyed any of the previous movies, then you definitely want to watch ""Fast & Furious 6"" as well.",paul_haakonsen,"Sep 1, 2013"
9,"Hail, hail the gang's all here - but now minus one","Mixed emotions his the viewer seeing FAST AND FURIOUS 6 for the first time knowing that Paul Walker is gone and wondering what will happen with the in process Fast and Furious 7. But in ways that fact makes this movie more treasured. It is a whoop-'em up fast action packed film that takes your breath away with the wild car chases and one the ground derring- do. Writer Chris Morgan and director Justin Lin have this medium down to a predictable but fine science.The plot is fairly simple (as usual) allowing the telling of the story to be more important than any big philosophical notions. Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson, with even larger biceps varices!) has Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) reassemble their crew (Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Sung Kang) in order to take down mastermind Shaw (Luke Evans) who commands an organization of mercenary drivers across 12 countries. Payment? Full pardons for them all. The big driver is to 'rescue' Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who seems to be with Shaw's group after suffering amnesia, back into their fold. Wild situations abound and they are as exciting as ever – if not more so!Definitely worth watching even for those who are not long term F & F fans. It is a terrific action film with sparkling actors having a great time. Grady Harp December 13",gradyharp,"Dec 12, 2013"
7,12 years after the first outing and the franchise is unrecognisable - which is a good thing,"The Fast and Furious franchise has undergone a radical transformation since launching 12 years ago, with the changes following Justin Lin taking hold of directorial duties from Tokyo Drift (film three) onwards.The series has made the transition from street races to include drugs, heists, and now terrorism, while lead characters Dom Toretto (Diesel) and Brian O'Conner (Walker) have gone from petty thug and law enforcer to wanted fugitives.With an opening sequence reminiscent of Quantum of Solace, Toretto and Brian screech around mountaintops as the latter readies himself to become a father, demonstrating how adult and family-minded they've become. Meanwhile, what follows is a nice refresher for those acquainted with the series and for newcomers alike, acting as a highlights reel to bring everyone up to speed of the events experienced in the previous five films.The antagonist for Fast 6 is Mr Owen Shaw (Evans), a former special ops military man that uses his knowledge, contacts and fast cars to make robberies for the highest bidder. In this instance, it just so happens he has his eyes on a chip that would incite terrorism in the wrong hands, which prompts baby oil-loving federal agent Hobbs (Johnson) to round up Toretto and his crew for back-up, offering them full pardons in exchange for their services.London is the main backdrop for the film, which, naturally, features a very corny cameo, though the the bright lights, black taxis and double-decker buses dotted around the city are infinitely more welcome.For me, five was the best of all of the films, but six gives it a run for its money, taking the stunts to ridiculous new heights (literally). You could, of course, reprimand the film for its use of impossible feats, but that's the whole point of these films, right? To get bigger and more extreme, as demonstrated with the big and extreme – and always affable – introduction of Johnson in Fast Five.For me, Johnson changed the game and breathed new life into a franchise that was beginning to get stale, and seeing Hobbs join forces with Toretto and co makes for brilliant viewing. The action is insane and the banter is electric, with the camaraderie between the cast obvious.The only criticism of the film is its length. There was a particular moment that seemed as though the film had wrapped, though it continued for another half hour, and while what followed was laced with adrenaline and big bangs, the film could have done with a 20 minute tightening.Shaw isn't an intimidating or imposing character, particularly when facing off against Hobbs and Toretto, but he is devious, ruthless and sharp, presenting an entirely new threat to the series.Those in the know will be aware Tokyo Drift threw the timeline entirely out of sequence, but the game comes full circle at the end of the film, and you won't want to miss the credits sequence that follows Originally posted at www.zentertainmentweekly.com7/10",zentertainmentweeklydotcom,"May 21, 2013"
9,Incredible! Thoroughly enjoyable!,"I still can't believe I am giving a 9.0 to a film that is #6 in a brainless action franchise!I am not aware of any other franchise (except maybe, strangely enough, f13) where #6 is the best of the series. Normally the energy, creativity are gone by then.Not this time.I simply cannot believe how much I enjoyed every single minute of this film!There was even a decent plot!! (hey, for a film that is basically made up of fast cars, explosions and fight scenes, that says a lot!)However, I won't go into the plot - because there are some REAL twists in it, and it is better to go in with a fresh mind.It does help if you have seen the prior 5, but no sweat if you haven't. What really pleasantly surprised me was how funny this film was!! I would say about 1/2 the film was gut splitting comedy. It is rare that most jokes work in a film. Usually some fall flat. Not in this one! every single joke worked. I laughed so hard that I know I missed some!This is really meant to be seen on the big screen with a large crowd. I can't remember the last time so many people laughed, went 'WHOA!"" and ""yeah"" even clapping during a film!The film starts off with a bang and ends with a post-ending that will make you grin from ear to ear.The film deals with criminals who are obsessed with fast cars and like to create mayhem with their cars.Wall to wall action, comedy with just the right amount of drama and love interest.This could be ""the"" measurement for the brainless-feel-good-summer- action film.The only reason I am not giving this a 10.0 is because 1) it was a little long.. the final scene was almost a movie in itself (but it was a hoot!), and 2) in general I don't think any film is perfect. In some scenes (thankfully only a few) there were too many close ups that made it a little hard to follow the action. But I am really nitpicking here, folks.If you like action, fast cars, explosions, comedy....run, don't walk to see F&F 6.(and this from a guy who has the Seventh Seal and Alexander Nevsky in his DVD collection)",fritzlang,"May 21, 2013"

6,A fun addition to the franchise,"As the Fast & Furious franchise continues with it's simple enjoyments of fast cars, well oiled muscles and sexy ladies. This film does meet expectations, and is your typical faster and bigger sequel. This time the story follows Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and the gang. Who are this time not being chased but being recruited by Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson). To bring down international criminal Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) who is aided by once thought of dead Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez).What is good about the film is Director's, Justin Lin's decision to keep the film in a action-oriented direction. With a slight nods to it's street racing past. But focusing on 80's big muscle, big explosions nostalgia. Also the continuing use of practical effects over CGI backgrounds and locations. Make the film look all the more impressive. The action is over the top and a little silly but i did very much enjoy it. The only poor bit being a moment where Vin Diesel's character saves someone life taking the ridiculousness a bit to far. With the ever expanding cast the writers i imagine do have their work cut out for them. But everyone in the film except Jordana Brewster who again is given the short shrift do get their moments. But some of the comedy does miss it's mark, and the return of Letty is given the thinnest and quite unoriginal of explanations for her return. Also because of the huge cast of good guys, there is a lack of development for the villains. Making it difficult for Luke Evans who is actually very good in his role, to make a strong impression and did not become the threat to the team as much as he should of. This is a fun film, so just turn off your brain and enjoy the ride and be prepared for a very decent post credit sequence hopefully setting up a possibly very exciting Fast 7.",paulsrobinson,"May 19, 2013"
7,Fast and Furious 6 review,"The previous installments of this franchise (specifically 1,2, Tokyo Drift and 4) was all about racing, sure there's a plot but it wasn't really shown well, then part 5 happened and the franchise took a different turn, it now became a heist film instead of the usual racing. I hated and I loved this turn of the franchise, I hated it because in part 5, the racing competition aspect of the film is gone, it became chases but I also loved this turn because it made the franchise take a different approach. My question is, will this formula still work with part 6? Find out below.Story: The story in this movie picks up after the previous one where it was known that 'Letty' (Michelle Rodriguez) was still alive and I admit that they handled her ""resurrection"" quite well but that is only the sub-plot of this movie. The main plot is Hobbs (The Rock) is chasing after Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). He then gets the help of Toretto and Brian's crew by using Letty as bait (or that's how I see it). The story is pretty simple and they told it without adding anymore sub plot but some of the sub plots that were made felt very crowded to the story even though it was solved. It just felt a little heavy and a bit too much for the movie.Acting: If you saw the previous installments from this franchise well then you ain't missing anything from their performance, it's pretty much the same but I have to say this though, Vin Diesel and The Rock displays pure bad-assery in this movie. That being said, I will give my two cents on the two characters from this movie which are Gina Carano who played Riley and Luke Evans who is Owen Shaw. Carano was able to hold her own despite having little dialogue and what makes her character seems badass is because of her action scene, this is actually one of the things I'm looking forward to upon seeing this movie because I loved her in 'Haywire' (awesome film, check it out) and I;m confident to say that I am not disappointed with her on this one. Next is Luke Evans, he IMO is one the versatile actors in the industry today, you can cast him in almost any role and he displays a good performance. In here is the main villain although he gave a good performance in this role I find it hard to find him as an effective villain, there is something missing with his performance here I'm just not sure what it is.Action: The Fast franchise is definitely known for having one of the best car chases ever and this one doesn't disappoint and it does not only have car chases but also fist fights, head bangin' and other sh*t. Even though some of the action scene were very over the top it was still entertaining and was handled pretty well. The action was not violent or brutal as it showed little to no blood and being a fan of R-13 I can say that this rating does not fit well to the style of FF and I'm happy and contented with it's PG-13 rating. IMO this is the most action-packed FF film so far.Cinematography: The cinematographer did a wonderful job here, the shots were just amazing and adds depth to the mood that is set within each scene. The shots were able to show scenery that really captures the beauty of the set and like I said the mood of the scene.Direction: I wasn't much of a fan of Lin's direction here, it was pretty slow which made the film a little boring for me despite having heavy action. Even though the movie is a little slow paced, Lin was able to tell the story with it's whole heart. I liked how he did the pacing in FF 5 though.Overall: 'Fast and Furious 6' was high-octane action movie injected with some humor. Using the same formula as the previous one made this film good and also bringing back the racing aspect of the original FF films. While I consider the FF 5 is still the best one in the franchise, I can still say that this is one solid addition to it. I give this movie a 3.5/5P.S. Watch the post-credit scene, it made me get hyped for Fast and Furious 7.",whoa17,"May 24, 2013"

7,Fuious 6,"I'm going to keep this short, simple and sweet because that is exactly what this film is. It's great summer fun for all ages that manages to succeed on the one thing I hate in horror movies; make an idiot of itself. It is where this stupidity in plot events comes from that gives the film its fuel to do nothing but provide brainless over-the-top popcorn fun. It is done so by having some of the best sound editing I have heard in a while with brilliantly paced action sequences, with one fight scene in particular that will surly be the best action scene of the year. I recommend Furious 6 if you're looking to have some fun, but whatever you do, do not walk in there expecting The King's Speech, because it is not what this movie is trying to be- which makes this film so admirable.Grade: B+",edwardscissorhands123,"Jun 4, 2013"
10,Film of the year,"I went to the cinema with quite low expectations due to the trailer. However after watching this film i was amazed by the outcome. There was so much thrilling tense action, at one point i was on the edge of my seat. The fights and the car chases were magnificent. The series seems to be getting better and better. Fast and furious 6 is by far the best one, and i can't wait for number 7. There was so much going on and the ending was awesome. I will definitely buy this on DVD when it comes out. Great acting from the casts. This is the most entertaining film of 2013 so far. There was epic cars, sexy girls and brilliant locations.10/10",losangcodbazzinga,"May 22, 2013"

7,"An Adrenaline-Fueled Action Ride, and a Good One at that.","The Fast and the Furious franchise has never been known for an engrossing story. No one goes to the movies to see character development and a complicated storyline. They go for the cars, the girls, and the explosions, and this installment has all of the above, including a fair story.A ghost from Dom's past, Letty, has come back from the dead, and Dom reunites the team from Fast Five (a team that works on all levels) in order to get her back. Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson provide some of the humor of the film, with their bantering back and forth throughout, but I found that the theater I was in laughed and cheered throughout the course of the movie. The action is good, and never lets up. For a film that is over two hours, I found myself only checking the time when I thought the finale was happening (to see how long it would be).What you want in this film is something as good as Fast Five. Something original and fresh. What you get is something that improves on Fast Five (and the rest of the series) on all levels. This is by far the best Fast and Furious movie ever, and it really shows how a series like this can turn around from something as bad as Tokyo Drift.And it has a nice set up for Fast & Furious 7 during the credits, where we get a little surprise for the villain of the next film.Bravo, this film is awesome, and should be viewed by fans of both the series and of action movies in general.8/10",Papatheodorou,"Jul 6, 2013"
8,Bold imagination and beautiful execution of some of the most exhilarating car chases ever done on film make this the unequivocal franchise best thus far,"Really, how many franchises can claim to be at their best the sixth time round? But that is exactly where the 'Fast and Furious' team are at with this exercise in pure exhilaration. Just when we feared that it might be difficult to top the jaw-dropping finale in 'Fast Five', director Justin Lin proves that he has reserved his best one yet for what has been announced as his final outing at the helm after four consecutive runs.Continuing what began as an invigorating transition from streetcar racing to heist film the last time round, resident scribe Chris Morgan ups the stakes by pitting our favourite anti-heroes against their most dangerous opponent yet. That man is Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), an ex-SAS officer turned mercenary who leads a nefarious gang of criminals bent on stealing the components capable of assembling a lethal weapon to be used by terrorists. As Tyrese Gibson's designated comic relief character Roman describes, Shaw's guys are pretty much the evil twins of Toretto's team, hence the return of other familiar supporting characters like Han (Sung Kang), Tej (Chris ""Ludicrous"" Bridges) and Gisele (Gal Gadot).Even as Morgan evolves the franchise, he understands that the character dynamics have been one of the highlights of each film, and this sequel to 'Fast Five' preserves and builds on the relationships that its predecessor established. Besides the budding romance between Han and Gisele (in our opinion, exotic and very nicely played) and the deepening of familial ties between O'Conner and Toretto's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) with the birth of their child, there is sensibly the return of Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), which through the last film, transformed from dogged adversary to unlikely ally.It is Hobbs who reunites Toretto's team together to pursue Shaw - the strategic equivalent of ""fighting fire with fire"" - with no less than the promise of full pardon if they succeed. Amidst the crowded ensemble, Morgan picks up on a new angle set in motion from the concluding events of the last film. Once presumed dead, Toretto's former squeeze Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) has turned up as one of Shaw's known associates, a good part of the quieter moments of the film spent rekindling the romance between the ex-lovers.Of course, this isn't a movie with many such moments - except for the occasional expositions about family - so you can forgive the lack of character development for new supporting additions Riley (MMA fighter and 'Haywire' star Gina Carano) and Jah ('The Raid's' Joe Taslim); the former Hobbs' new partner and the latter Shaw's kungfu-kicking henchman. Instead, both Carano and Taslim are there to add a different flavour of adrenaline in the form of close-combat fight scenes, and let's just say that they each get their own sequence to show off their respective moves.But aside from an impressive bit of tag-team ass-kicking from Toretto and Hobbs against one of Shaw's equally hulk-sized crew (Kim Kold), the bulk of the action is meant to unfold against broad open canvases, as opposed to close quarters. Lin neatly - and we might add, beautifully - choreographs three elaborate chase sequences with loads of automobile destruction that the franchise has been known for, even more extraordinary for how he manages to top one after the next.In chronological order, Lin begins with a grand introduction to Shaw and his gang with an intricately staged chase down the streets of London - although the fact that Shaw's military-styled vehicle looks like the Batmobile from Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight' trilogy might provide a hint where Lin could have gotten his inspiration. Yet any doubts about Lin's originality are quickly dispelled once we get to the second setpiece, a boldly imagined art of mass destruction matched equally in its stunning execution. As the trailer has amply teased, this one has Toretto and his crew behind the wheel in pursuit of Shaw and his men inside a tank on a Canaries highway.The most breathtaking of all he leaves for last, which though utterly ludicrous, represents probably one of the most awesome stunt pieces you will see this year. Since no other film has dared to use cars to take down a Russian cargo plane about to take off, Lin does just that. Not only do Toretto's team face off with Shaw's mob in cars racing at near impossible speeds, they attach their vehicles to the wings of the plane with gleeful abandon to any thought of their own lives - though as a warning, not all will make it through to the already announced sequel next summer. If Lin intends to go out with a 'bang', let's just say he accomplishes it many times over.The exquisitely staged vehicular mayhem is complemented by a firm sense of camaraderie amongst Toretto's group. Gibson's one-liners are snappy and more amusing than they were in 'Fast Five', and his banter with Kang and Ludicrous not only keep the film's momentum going while the plot pieces are put in place but also establish the kind of teamwork necessary for the subsequent action scenes. And not forgetting the brawny charisma of Diesel and Johnson, which enliven the film as much as they did in the last one.If you ask us to judge this against then-franchise best 'Fast Five', we'd say that this more than tops the fun and excitement that it offered. There are two qualities which make or break a 'Fast and Furious' film - how enjoyable is it to hang out with Toretto and his crew and how thrilling are the car chases. On both counts, this sixth entry surpasses the heights established by its predecessor, setting an even higher bar for its successor. But if the coda before the end credits is anything to go by, there's plenty of reason to get excited for next summer's follow-up.",moviexclusive,"May 21, 2013"
7,"Fast 6, Fast but not quite as Furious as the previous outing","The Fast and Furious franchise is one of the more strange ones – it improved the older it became. Coinciding with the 10 year anniversary of the The Fast and the Furious, Fast 5 marked the highpoint in the hugely popular series. Street racing culture was ditched in favor of a heist plot in Rio de Janeiro. To say it worked would be a massive understatement. Fast 6 is continuing where its predecessor left off, although with a little twist. As it has already been explained in the trailers, the team surrounding Vin Diesel's Torreto character is asked to help Luke Hobbs (played by the ever charismatic Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) capturing criminal mastermind Owen Shaw (portrayed by Luke Evans), this time around in London. The Good Working in its favor is the wonderful backdrop provided by the London metropolitan area. It offers a lot of variety and distinguishes Fast 6 from the previous entry. The chemistry between Torreto's crew is as good as it has ever been. Furthermore, The Rock really meshes well with any of the gang.Tyrese, without going into detail the banter he shares with Ludicrous or the aforementioned Dwayne Johnson is worth the ticket admission alone. It's obvious that his character serves as comedic relief, as has been the case in Fast 5, but he has to have the funniest scenes in any of the major (non-comedy) blockbusters this year. The action in the FF series was never realistic to begin with, so no surprises here. Still, it shouldn't take away from some impressive set- pieces. Justin Lin knows what he's doing. The Bad Fast 6 is too crowded; there are too many characters in the movie. Even the main villain, Owen Shaw, is underdeveloped, as is the Letty sub- plot. It just feels like the producers were gung-ho about reuniting the principle actors from the very first FF movie, at any cost. Gina Carano, though she can definitely hold her own in the action scenes her acting is wooden at best. If pressed for a comparison – she'd be a bad female imitation of notorious stoneface Keanu Reeves. There's little to no facial expression. Frankly, her character is redundant. She may have pulled a half-decent performance in Haywire, but given the nature of her character (a stoic, hardened, operative) it played right to her strengths (or lack thereof?). At this rate it's hard to see her carrying a movie anytime soon. Conclusion Fast 6 is one of the better flicks in the franchise, perhaps the second best, but some way off Fast 5. One can't help but feel that the finished product has been rushed into production. A little fine-tuning (no pun intended) here and there would've served the movie better. The ending in particular is a little underwritten; it's not as glorious or as satisfying as Fast 5.",j-pryde,"May 19, 2013"

7,Level of Absurdity,"2011's Fast Five was the franchise's glory for abandoning the sins that slows down their movies and excel to something crazier and suitable to what it is called. Fast & Furious 6 grows the scale with even more ridiculous car racing and stunts. Now it involves a fight between military and terrorism while it has a serious sentiment about family. Things can get way out of hand, but the film is so fun, it's hard complain about how stupid it is. It's not a classic, but the stuff that are supposedly awkward actually made the film a fantastically exhilarating ride.Before, there were just street racing and cartels. The last one is about an extreme heist. Now they are chasing down super terrorists, running away from tanks, and a character who faked her death. The more stories they tell, the sillier it becomes, but no matter how absurd these are, they are still a pleasure to watch. They are really forgetting the mistakes of the past(first four) films and think more creative ways to excite the viewers. The series also finally has a highlighting villain. A campy one as well that could fit in a superhero movie. The weakest parts of the story are the twists that are much inane than the craziness it was displayed. The sideline of the plot is about family. It contrasts between Dom's team who are loyal, and Owen's team who are careless. It's a fine speculation but nobody would care about it.We are here for the racing, cars crashing, and some fistfights. The last film had cars that can pull off a vault, now we see a bunch of cars pulling down a cargoplane. It shows how it insanely ignores the laws of physics. It's exasperating if you take it too seriously, but I don't think anyone would ever take a blockbuster like this too seriously. However, they are amazingly directed. The tank scene, which was already beyond ridiculous, was kind of inspired. And the early London chase was an energetic sequence. The performances are the same before. What's new about Vin Diesel is the swagger he makes in the end. Dwayne Johnson is always entertaining, but he is much entertaining when he was beating a guy around an interrogation room. Newcomer Luke Evans really makes a worth rooting villain. His character is not as well developed as any villains from big blockbusters, but he manages to make this one slickly fun.Fast & Furious 6 reaches the scale of blockbusters that have superheroes, super spies, aliens, or whatever. Except the cars are the ones that have superpowers here. These set of magnificently dumb action sequences reminiscence your standard blockbuster when this film is suppose to be smaller than those kinds of films. It's strangely grander and louder, but of course, it's also as fast as the title suggests. Verdict would still call Fast Five the best of the series, but honestly they are both equally good. This one just takes a new level of absurdity even though the characters are trying to be down to earth. Fast & Furious 6 is far from perfect but as a modern blockbuster it's an extremely entertaining film.",billygoat1071,"May 25, 2013"

6,Quirky humor and insane set pieces overcome its shoddy plot,"While it doesn't reach the same height as Fast Five, the newest and most ludicrous installment of the franchise thus far still packs a lot of noisy high octane entertainment in its engine. With increasingly expanding star-studded cast, Fast & Furious 6 exhibits a lot of value by just pinning these familiar names together in scenes, despite some of the script they use doesn't really work. It has good amount of humor, and also highly dubious amnesia plot. Quite frankly, it does its best when it doesn't try to be serious.Starring buff gents and ladies, almost everyone on-screen has weighty name, although they are heavily leaning towards action oriented rather than acting, which might've been the direction from the start. Plot revolves around Vin Diesel trying to woe the amnesic Michelle Rodriguez, thus involving the crew into a shady military operation in the process. It gives what people want in spade, the bridging between set pieces is fairly clumsy, but it does pay off with ridiculous amount of flying cars and bodies.Surprisingly enough, there are plenty of melee brawl across the movie. The addition of Gina Carano, the MMA star, is a good choice, she brings the rawness in these scenes. Several others will join the fray in close combat, obvious if they have The Rock and Vin Diesel it'd be a waste not to. However, there are some stunts that borderline corny and unrealistic, even by Fast and Furious standard, many wiring might look awkward as well. It's not a major concern, but I prefer the more structured natural stunts rather the high flying ones.Chasing scenes have been up-scaled, bringing ramp cars, tank and whatnot into the mix. Apparently, there's demand for even more over-the-top driving scenes to fulfill. This is where it truly shines, fast motion, carnage all around and seemingly impossible traits. The building up and finish are somewhat imbalance, sometimes resorting to incredibly odd coincidences. Script works adequately, some of its jokes are better than others, and definitely league ahead compare to the supposedly more dramatic scenes.Fast & Furious goes extra miles for crowd enjoyment. Action junkies or car enthusiast will be pleased, however the result is less organized pace. The movie is a blast, even if there are shortcomings, catering directly to the core audience.Rate 6.5",quincytheodore,"May 23, 2013"
6,Loads of Action!,"Review: I quite enjoyed this action packed movie, which had a decent storyline and loads of car chases and explosions. It's basically want you expect from a movie in this franchise, which was what I found a bit disappointing because there wasn't much fresh ideas. The tank and the plane was a bit different but that was about it. What made me laugh was the length of the runway for the plane scene and it was amazing how they made England look so glossy. Anyway, if you look at the money that the movie made, expect many sequels and with the introduction of the Rock in the last movie, he has obviously made a massive difference to the franchise. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Everyone in this movie has been in the gym before there scenes because it sacked full of muscles. Even the ladies show that they can hold there own against the men. The Rock is over pumped and in every scene he looks like he's sweating because he has just put the weights down. Anyway, the director done a good job with putting this movie together, especially as it was set in England. Some of the stunts were a bit over the top, but that's what you expect from a Fast & Furious movie. All the way through the film, Vin Diesel is sizing himself up next to the Rock, but I liked the chemistry between them. In all, there wasn't anything that really stood out about the film, but it does keep you on the edge of your seat and you just don't know what there going to come up with next. Maybe boats or horses, lol.Budget: $160million Worldwide Gross: $789millionI recommend this movie to people who are into the Fast & Furious franchise, which always brings loads of action and, of course, cars. 6/10",leonblackwood,"Sep 22, 2013"
8,In life Speed and Family are the two best things,"From the first frame of Fast and Furious 6 we realize that this is not really about a movie about heist and car chases (well okay it has this); no this is a movie about the depths you will go and the willingness to do whatever you can to protect family. Leaving off where Fast five left off, most of the characters are off on there, whether it be hanging in Tokyo, flying pretty ladies to manacu to making people feel low about there rough life to a new baby being born, the crew is in hiding and living the life abroad. It's at the point that the plot ramps up and we get a Dom Terretto going after a would be thief Owen Shaw ( a new type of villain) and trying to save the somehow resurrected Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) who has joined Shaw in his wanting to take over the world. Bring most people back from the Fast Five and you got yourself a movie. This movie isn't what I call the most coherent, it has issues and Owen Shaw's character is kind of one note, but this isn't the type of movie that you need to worry about great story. It's the type of movie that you go to watch and have fun , and watch the unbelievable happen. Everyone In this movie looks like there comfortable being there and seem to be having fun. It's what I would call an audience movie, the type of movie that feels In sync enough that everyone's on board There are plenty of laughs thanks to Tyrese and plenty of drama thanks to Toretto and Brian's relationship and history in the series. They pull together to do the subject justice. I don't want to spoil anything but this movie does lead up to a point that all the films finally have a connecting tissue and what you thought you knew with the bonus scene at the end will lead into an interesting 7th film. Lets just hope James Wan doesn't ruin the good will this series has gained.",buiredintime,"May 14, 2013"

8,Definitely Fast and Definitely Furious,"I'm not to fond a franchises that don't when it's time to hang it up and let it's running time leave a good memory in our brains but for some reason, the studios want to keep this franchise going but I must say I'm glad they haven't because Fast and Furious 5 was pretty dope and now I can say Fast and Furious 6 is just as equally amazing. I was actually excited to see this movie and believe me when I say, I wasn't disappointed in the least. I'm an action movie junkie, and this film had plenty of it. I've been enjoying the F&F transformation from being a movie about illegal street racing and stealing car parts, to heists, drug lords, undercover agents, the cartel and now, even terrorism. There was plenty of car chases, hand to hand combat, shoot outs and even a breathtaking ending scene hat involved an airport, a huge aircraft and a takeoff runway that was definitely awesome to watch. Doing six films would definitely bring the cast together, and you can see their chemistry on screen, especially between Tyrese, Ludicrous, the Asian dude and the south American beauty. There comedic banter was funny. I was pleasantly surprised with our antagonist, Luke Evans. I'm used to seeing him play the hero and aiding the good side, so seeing him as the bad guy was different but it worked. Not only is a beyond sexy with that shaved head but it totally worked. My favorite scene was with Riley (from Haywire) chasing Michelle Rodriguez through the subway and Tyrese and Asian dude's character chasing the other bad guy through the subway. My only pet peeve was the dialogue. You would think that after six movies, the writers could come up with more realistic things for the cast to say instead writing all these cheesy one liners that we've been hearing in 90% of all action movies for the past twenty years. Some of the lines really made me cringe and I had to whisper to myself ""really Justin Lin?! That's the best you got?!"" But the cheesy one liners were overlooked by a few unpredictable plot twists that helped the story move along.But overall I give this movie an 8 because it gives you everything an action movies is supposed to offer. Believable bad ass heroes and villains, car chases, big guns, explosions, shoot outs, hand to hand combat, sexy ass kicking women, beautiful cars, sexy men, funny moments, an unforgettable ending action sequence, and of course a post credits scene that makes you anxious for the seventh film. I would definitely recommend this film.",champjohnson29,"May 27, 2013"
6,"Brash, noisy, silly...and quite entertaining","FAST & FURIOUS 6 is a step up from its predecessor, FAST FIVE, which had the genius idea of adding Dwayne Johnson to the cast, but otherwise was a bit too soulless and flashy for its own good. Despite the lengthy running time, this one knuckles down straight away with a thriller-focused storyline in which Toretto and his team and allies travel to London to take down a master criminal by the name of Shaw. The hook is that the once-thought-dead Michelle Rodriguez is now working for Shaw's team.Inevitably, the plotting of FAST & FURIOUS 6 doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and instead it's all about the action. If you like seeing fast cars tearing up the streets of the British capital, then this is the film for you. You can easily play a drinking game and down a shot every time a London double decker bus appears in a shot; you'll be passed out by the time the credits roll.This film is brash, noisy, and quite exciting. It still suffers from being exceptionally cheesy during some of the really big action scenes, like the bits with the tank and the plane, but overall it holds together pretty well and offers basic entertainment value, which is what this series is all about anyway. The established stars of the franchise like Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are rather muted and subdued here, content to let newcomers like Luke Evans, Gina Carano, and a returning Johnson garner all of the attention, and I was pleased to see more minor roles for cult favourites like Clare Paget (BLACK SAILS) and Joe Taslim (THE RAID). FAST & FURIOUS 6 isn't a perfect film by any means, but it achieves what it aims to do and with one hell of a teaser during the end credits I can't wait to see the next one.",Leofwine_draca,"Jan 20, 2016"
8,Physics defying and entertaining,"This is a really good, action packed, physics defying and entertaining film. After Vin Diesels return to the series it has been better and better, yes they still drive cars, yes they still do heists, yes they make it look really easy and cool to race a car and drive recklessly, but it all works, it is very entertaining and fun.I also think the new not just racing cars work for this series of films, there has to be more to it then racing, the family aspect and action aspects really gives it something new and exciting.I don't know what is going to happen with the seventh installment of this, now that Paul Walker can't be part of the crew, he did a great job and will be missed, but I hope they continue in the same spirit and if nothing else finish it off in a nice way.",osj2507,"Jun 10, 2015"

6,Watch it with half the brain you used to watch Fast Five with,"Oh wow, this is what you call jumping the shark. It all started in 2001 with a low budget film about the street racing subculture. Now its become an action film franchise with over the top machismo. Each film progressively chipped away more logic and physics.Now I actually liked Fast Five because it actually had a believable premise given the context. Yes it was cheesy and over testosteroned but it actually had a well paced plot. However the cast has ballooned to a very large size, this film's become very unfocused. So much so that every character is now laughably one dimensional. There are numerous contrived plot points and no character ever questions anything. The Rock's character is after a bad guy but since the bad guy uses cars, oh, I need Vin Diesel AND HIS TEAM for this. And yeah, everyone is willing no question.I thought that Fast Five actually concluded the characters story arcs but they wanted to due a fan service by resurrecting Michelle Rodriguez. And it was done in the most contrived fashion as possible by giving her amnesia.The film did have some pretty good set pieces but sadly you saw all these action sequences in the trailer. And thats because the film slows down in the second act and it tries to liven up by even putting in a street race in the middle of a surprisingly empty London. And that's weird seeing how each film's plot revolves around how many car stunts they can put in.And the action scenes really make the vault drag in Fast Five physically plausible. There is so much flying around and defying gravity, I'll bet you'll see less in the upcoming Superman film. And the physics of this film is so inconsistent. In the tank scene we see the villain engage in casual murder by pancaking all the cars in a highway yet it seems to have trouble crushing Tyrese's car. Also the plane scene in the climax; that must be the longest runway in the world.I can see why Justin Lin took this franchise to that many films, because the initial ones weren't that profitable. However at over 2 hours long, you start wondering how you could take any of the cheesy dialogue that fills this film seriously.Oh well, its pure popcorn pleasure. It knows what it does, even though you'll be palming your forehead at many instances.",arnieiam,"Jun 4, 2013"
7,Above the Standard for This Franchise,"Back for their 6th adventure, the stakes have never been higher for the FF fam. With the introduction of Owen Shaw, the team gets faced with a criminal mastermind, unlike any they have met so far. Luke Evans bring a serious, but fun villain into the franchise, breathing fresh air into the forgettable villains of the previous installments. The FF team has a bond you can feel on and off the screen, as they are clearly having a blast reuniting each film. The action is just as strong as ever and we are treated to quite a few memorable action sequences, which stand-out against the once car racing franchise. While the story may feel somewhat repetitive of the predecessors, it's the charm of the cast that will bring you back in for the above standard Fast & Furious 6.",Ltufano23,"Nov 5, 2023"
7,This Time They're in London,"It seems as if these movies are getting better and better as time goes on (though not so good that they warrant anything more than a seven – they are mindless actions movies. In a way it seems like ages since I watched the first couple of movies and also, in a way, they simply seem to be nothing like the ones that are being churned out now. In fact, it seems that ever since Justin Lin took the helm the movies have simply gone from being rather dull cop movies to being a full blown, fully intense, action movie. Mind you, with this one having a tank roaring down a motorway it does make me wander how Lin is going to top the previous editions in numbers 8 and 9 (IMDB suggested that after number 8 there are another three movies but I suspect that this is a typo).Anyway, after striking it rich in Rio by stealing a hundred million dollars off of a drug lord, the crew have all gone their separate ways. However Hobbs as been tipped off that Vincent's girlfriend isn't actually dead, and in fact involved with some rather despicable characters that make Toretto, O'Conner and their team look like angels (and since they are the heroes of the film you could suggest that they are, but they are more like anti-heroes than anything else). Anyway Hobbs gets in contact them because he realises that the best way to catch a crook is with a crook, and of course Toretto is the first that comes to mind.Number six is set in London, which is a good thing because I have been to London – three times. Okay, I can hardly call myself an expert on the city, but I do have this attachment to the place, and do enjoy watching movies set there, even if they do stupid things, like having a drag race through the centre of the city, pass Picadilly Circus and finishing up at Battersea when it is impossible it escape the stop start traffic unless it is 6:00 am on a Sunday morning (okay, it isn't that bad, but try driving along Euston road and see how long it takes you to get from Islington and out of the city).In a way this film seems to deal more with a collection of anti-heroes, and sort of exposes Vin Diesel's roleplaying past – having people with different talents working together as part of a team is something that is central to most, if not all, roleplaying games, and they tend to work a lot better if you aren't constrained by a government organisation. Okay, Diesel and Walker are still the major characters, and also the precision drivers, and they still have a single drag race in the film (though there are plenty of car chases, including one with a tank), but we are now moving on to much bigger things – in fact no more drug lords because now we are up against mercenaries who are doing things that your average drug-lord isn't getting involved in. In the end, expect a pretty wild ride, but nothing incredibly deep.",The-Sarkologist,"Dec 12, 2016"
8,Pure Entertainment,"Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker) are asked by Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) to stop Shaw (Luke Evans) the leader of a criminal crew of skilled mercenary drivers who are acquiring parts to build a powerful gun to be sold to terrorists. Shaw needs one last chip to complete the gun. If successful Dom's crew will get a full pardon from their illegal exploits during Fast and Furious 5. I was told that F&F 6 was the best one of all the sequels, And, after seeing this I believe they are correct. Of course it was all the vehicle chases that made it for me. What I saw was almost unbelievable. I don't know how much CGI was in evidence, but I do know that over 70 stunt men were used (I counted them in the credits) so I would venture to say these stunts with vehicles were fantastic.You will see some things that you will have you saying, ""that's impossible."" Maybe so, but this is excellent entertainment. Suspend logic and enjoy yourself. The photography and editing were incredible to say the least. As you watch you may have wished your couch came with seat belts. Kudos all around. You go to these kinds of movies to see the vehicle chases, not for the acting which was okay for this is type of movie. For the most part , there is not a lot of dialogue in here. Oh, and for your viewing pleasure the director saw fit to throw in an Army tank and a big cargo plane. Wait until you see how they are used. Wow! This just gets better and better. So if you like car chases with vehicles and people flying thru the air, and explosions this is for you. Hey, I was entertained. Yes, there is a story here too, but it plays second fiddle and there is a twist you may not see coming. Also, Dom finds out that his former love interest, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), is alive and working for Shaw (Say What???). How can this be? Dom needs to find out. Oh, when it's all over keep your seat belt on because after many of the credits run, you will see that F&F 7 is in the works and you won't believe who will be in it. Stay tuned. (8/10)Violence: Yes.

No rating,Amazing! Awesome!,"Fast and Furious is an American series of action films. But I Think the best one is fast and Furious 6 by Justin Lin which was produced by ""Media Original Film"" and ""One Race Films"" and writes by Chris Morgan. It was made in 2013 in Untied State. It tells the story of Dominic Toretto,Brian O'Conner, Luke Hobbs, Letty Ortiz and Gisèle Harabo played by Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez and Gal Gadot. Fast & Furious 6 follows a professional criminal gang led by Dominic Toretto (Diesel) who have retired following their successful heist in Fast Five (2011), but remain wanted fugitives. U.S. Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agent Luke Hobbs (Johnson) offers to clear the group's criminal records and allow them to return home in exchange for helping him to take down a skilled mercenary organization led by Owen Shaw (Evans), one member of which is Toretto's presumed-dead lover Letty Ortiz (Rodriguez). I personally think it's an irresistible film, it's captivating and so exiting. I will recommend it because the acting is awesome and the script is bright.",elarfaoui,"Oct 23, 2017"
7,A surprisingly enjoyable film.,"Fast & Furious 6 is not the kind of film that I generally like. It's preposterous, absurd and completely in your face. But I enjoyed it! It's not really a good film, let alone a great one. However, that does not really matter. This is a film that does not take itself too seriously - and it's all the better for it. The director and the cast seem to know exactly what they're doing - and they deliver a film that won't live long in the memory but which nonetheless provides two hours or so of solid entertainment that allows the viewer to forget about the stresses and strains of modern life for a while. And, it does so very well indeed. Much of the film is set in London. The plot strains credulity and is full of holes. It took me a while to get used to some of the characters and what I assume were occasional references to their back stories (because I have not seen any of the 5 earlier films in this seemingly ever popular series). But, to be honest, the details of the plot are not really that important. Fast & Furious 6 is an almost wholly visual film about machismo, crazy driving sequences and adventure. Vin Diesel (that cannot be his real name, surely?) is very good in the lead role and he is ably supported by a cast that seems to have been plucked from the United Nations branch of central casting. I particularly liked Luke Evans (Owen Shaw), who plays the arch baddie.Fast & Furious 6 is the sort of film that defies rational criticism. It's a delightfully innocent, energetic and enjoyable romp. 7/10",roger-pettit1,"May 20, 2013"

7,Just another evolution of the series not the revolution,"Like a well-oiled engine, the Fast & Furious series can be counted on to deliver what it promises on the box: gleaming cars, thrilling chases, and buff stars who look like they've stepped out of the pages of a fitness magazine. The new installment, Fast & Furious 6 is just as dumb as the previous films, and its action scenes so furiously edited that it's hard to tell who's doing what, and to whom. But, as we've come to learn, that's the charm of these moviesthe stunts are outrageous, and the plot basic enough for an eight-year-old to enjoy.The new film opens with our heroes Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) enjoying their retirement, when federal agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) shows up to recruit them in a mission to capture professional hijacker Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). The incentive for Don is a possible reunion with his ex, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who was presumed dead at the end of the fourth film and who now may be working with Shaw.Director Justin Lin packs the film with back-to-back chases and set-pieces, never giving you a moment to ponder over the fact that you have no idea till the end, exactly what our villain is after – some codes are mentioned, but never clearly explained. The action itself is outrageous, and whether we're seeing real stunts or special effects, or a cocktail of both, it's pretty entertaining stuff. Cars are flipped like pancakes every few seconds, an armored tank creates carnage on a bridge, and an airplane is demolished in the climax.For those who enjoy their action a little more gritty, you'll be happy to know Gina Carano (Mixed Martial Arts star, and leading lady of Steven Soderbergh's Haywire) is cast as Hobbs' sidekick, and she gets down and dirty in a thrilling girl-on-girl fistfight with Rodriguez in the London Underground.Don't expect any improvement in the dialogue – the actors still mouth lines that appear to have been stolen from bumper stickers – and the performances are basically a range of stock expressions: angry, very angry, mad as hell.At 2 hours and 11 minutes, it's a little too long, and even the most devoted action-movie fans will sense the exhaustion creeping in. But don't leave until you've caught that post- credits cameo from a popular British star who sets up next year's seventh installment.I'm going with seven ratings for Fast & Furious 6. It's loud and noisy, and a lot of fun even if it doesn't make much sense.",visheshvijay,"Aug 4, 2013"
2,This is an opinion review,"I walked into the cinema expecting to write something about this being the must see film for the weekend, remembering the nostalgia of the original and the progressively worse but still kinda cool sequels (except for that abortion Tokyo Drift we'd all like to forget we saw) and the redeeming previous installment Fast Five that somehow redeemed and reinvented the franchise introducing 'The Rock' as a kick-ass anti-hero and started the franchise on a remarkably cool path with fast paced action that was grounded with a great balance of realism and ""plausible"" suspension of belief.What I walked away with was having my mind raped by the worse script (CENSORED) It is near impossible to believe this is the same writer and director duo from Fast Five - but then they were also responsible for Tokyo Drift. Firstly, for some reason they have dropped all of the iconic moments that we have come to love and expect. There is no action packed opening scene filled with car chases and metal carnage. Instead we are treated to being teased with a quick race where nothing happens and shown the aftermath of what must've been an incredible heist, and then, when we eventually do get to see some car chase scenes we quickly realize that they have also done away with those camera shots that weave in and out of the cars putting you in the center of the action.Gone is the great balance of realism and ""plausible"" suspension of belief and instead Furious 6 was written with absolutely no regard to physics or common sense. It's one thing to have cars flipped over by driving head first into them with a ramp attached to the car, its another thing entirely to have bobbies keeping pace with a super fast custom F1 type of thing and almost overtaking it. But that's small compared to the crap they actually came up with for this movie. Think super fast chase scenes with a tank (oxymoronic) and people flying through the air superman style like neo catching a damsel in distress mid air after being flung from... I'm just gonna stop there. Have your eyes raped spoiler free but don't blame me for the loss of reasoning skills as you're trying to forget to think all together just so you can soak up the visual aspects of this redonculous spectacle.It's actually infuriating to watch a movie with some cool bits while realizing the absurdity of what you are expected to swallow.At one point there's this huge cargo plane landing on a runway but keeps cruising so it can take off again and this 20min action scene develops with cars driving into the cargo hold of the plane and fighting erupting everywhere, in the plane, around the plane and it never runs out of runway, for over 20 minutes. Now call me crazy but at some point everyone in the cinema turned to each other and said this is ridiculous, we all as a unit got up and refused to have our intelligence mocked while expecting to sit through this crap and we burned the place to the ground.Here's some math: a typical airliner cruises at about 160mph for takeoff. 160 ÷ 60 x 20 = a 53.3 mile long runway.The best thing about the movie was the fighting between the female characters. That's probably because they cast MMA star Gina Carano opposite Michelle Rodriguez.Will this be one of those movies you love to hate or is it simply too mind numbingly $#*&?",dewetnmail,"Jul 27, 2013"
No rating,Sky's the limit,"This film tells the story of a gang of notorious criminals, who is asked by a government agent to track down and take down a dangerous criminal. The leader of the gang, Dominic Toretto, faces unexpected obstacles as this mission involves his missing girlfriend.It is amazing how every ""The Fast and the Furious"" films outdo itself. I thought the fifth one is pretty amazing, but ""Fast and Furious 6"" just outshines the previous ones again. The action sequences here are simple jaw dropping. The sky is the limit when it comes to action scenes. You think you have seen the most daredevil scenes? They push the limit even more just a few minutes later. I thought the really intense central London car chase scene was the climactic finale, but the film didn't end. There was still 30 minutes to go because the real finale involves many cars, a plane and many fights. The whole airplane scene is simply beyond my imagination. It is so good. Now that I have finally watched all 1-7 films, I am anticipating the 8th one.",Gordon-11,"Mar 26, 2017"
6,"Nail-biting sequel plenty of noisy action ; being mostly filmed in London and Canary Islands , Spain","The picture mingles action-packed , thrills , drama , exciting car pursuits , suspense , fights , a little bit of violence and spectacular sequences though won't mean much on little screen TV. It's a summer Blockbuster where reality , plot and dialog have no place . Since Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian's (Paul Walker) Rio heist toppled a kingpin's empire and left their crew with $100 million, our heroes have scattered across the globe. But their inability to return home and living forever on the lam have left their lives incomplete. Meanwhile, Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) has been tracking an organization of lethally skilled mercenary drivers across 12 countries, whose mastermind (Luke Evans) is aided by a ruthless second-in-command revealed to be the love Dom thought was dead, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez). The only way to stop the criminal outfit is to outmatch them at street level, so Hobbs asks Dom to assemble his elite team in London. Payment? Full pardons for all of them so they can return home and make their families whole again. As Brian goes undercover to infiltrate a prison to figure out dark secrets.This is an exciting follow-up with exceptionally fine camera work and great car chase sequences and crashes on the metropolitan streets , motorways , airport and several other places . The drivers, the cars , explosions are the real stars of this movie from the beginning to the end . Dennis McCarthy, the man behind building the vehicles used in the fast car franchise says that they used ""a whole fleet of BMW M5s"" in order to complete one sequence . Pulse-quickening action but plenty of clichés and lots of dirty driving and heavier on crashes than coherency . All stunts were performed by authentic experts without people damage . Drivers challenge their contenders for car races , through illicit street racing and highways , even less legal, with tank included ; causing wreak havoc racing 195 mph . The tank chase was originally planned to be created via CGI, but director Justin Lin insisted that it had to be done practically with some post-production enhancements . Several hero cars for the new film are being procured from California-based Lucra Cars . Very much in the B-movie tradition of the original ¨Gone in 60 seconds¨, ¨Grand theft auto¨ and ¨Eat my dust¨. Paul Walker does impress again in the role of a retired cop who goes back in action to help his friends . Again Vin Diesel as the patriarch-philosopher-thief character , the head of a tight-knit family or quirky thieves hopped on car exhaust adrenaline . Nice support cast such as Tyrese Gibson , Sung Kang , Gal Gadot , Ludicrous , Luke Evans , Elsa Pataky and Gina Carano . Thrilling and rousing musical score by the Spanish Lucas Vidal . Colorful as well as glamorous cinematography by Stephen F Windon . Justin Lin's direction (he previously made Annapolis and Better Luck tomorrow , The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift) is competent though the story eventually run out of gas . Two theater-sized units were used for post-production work overseen by director Justin Lin . The flick will appeal to adrenaline lovers and those young people looking for strong emotions. This is the kind of film in which the cars enthusiastic will enjoy immensely, it's a must see for car fonds.",ma-cortes,"Apr 24, 2014"
6,"A well shot, fun, ridiculous, dumb action movie","So let me ask you a question. Imagine there is a man who had been involved in dangerous criminal activities in the past. Having managed to survive and even earn some money, he now has a wife and a young child. An old acquaintance shows up and tries to entice the man to go back to doing dangerous work. What would be the man's reaction be and what would be his wife's reaction? If you answered something like, ""the man would decline and the wife would get furious and probably start yelling"", then you are a sane human living in the real world. That's not the world this film is set in.In this world, a British policeman shoots a submachine gun from the open window of his car on a busy street. Family and perfectly good lives are being abandoned for the sake of a questionable adventure. Pretty girls are running around with guns and driving fast cars. Everyone spits very cool moronic lines.The movie throws character and story development right out of the window and makes whatever shortcuts it needs to make to get you to the speeding cars as soon as possible.Because what Fast and Furious does well is its signature action racing. There is a good variety of speeding vehicles getting smashed and doing the smashing. All that action is really well shot. The cuts between the shots are fast but not erratic. The shots are made from interesting angles, often from the bystander's perspective. There are quite a few fight scenes and those are well choreographed and well shot. In fact, there are usually several fights scenes happening at the same time and you can tell who is punching whom, where and how. Compliments to the stunt team.To its credit, even though the plot only exists to get you from one action scene to the next and it is not very logical, on a micro scale, you do understand what is going on from scene to scene. As the movies progressed, the overall plot mattered less and less, and the situational narrative and the relationship between the characters mattered more and more. I wished the plot would stay away, but it raised its ugly head again towards the end.The acting from the leads, Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Dwayne Johnson hold up this film. Diesel and Rodriguez still have chemistry. If anything, these people got better at doing the Fast and Furious schtick. Dwayne Johnson as the lawman brings the much-needed fun to the movie, given the fact that Vin's and Paul's characters are always so serious, playing the same old puppy-eyed good guys.The character of the British villain played by Luke Evans does not bring much flavour besides being evil, but at least he does his job at appearing really cold and calculating.The rest of the crew are not as good, though neither is the script they are given to read, as the dialogue consists primarily of shallow one-liners. Interestingly though, the better dialogue is saved for the team of the British villain. In fact, I wish those guys got more screen time and development. The side characters are really at their best when they shut up and fight.What is really funny, whether intentionally or unintentionally, is the by now famous runway scene at the end. Somewhere in Spain there is a military base that has a runway that runs the entire circumference of the Earth.In conclusion, Fast and Furious 6 is a B movie from the 80s that received a huge budget and prominent actors, who were diligently showing up to work, in spite of reportedly getting sick of this franchise.",JaydoDre,"Jul 6, 2014"
7,"The Family, The Crazy Action, The Cars","American agents Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Riley (Gina Carano) are after super international criminal Shaw (Luke Evans) and his crew. Shaw is stealing components to assemble an electronic super weapon. Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and the others have scattered around the world after their heist in Brazil in 'Fast Five'. Hobbs lures Dom and the others back with intel that Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is still alive. With the promise of pardons, Dom and the family take on their evil twins.The family is back. So is the ridiculous story and the crazy action. And there are the cars, and the babes. If you're a fan of the franchise, then you'll love this. Even if you're not, you'll probably have a fun time. Having Gina Carano fight is a great addition for this movie. She and Michelle Rodriguez have a couple of great fights. The one in the subway is epic. The fact is Gina always looks real when she starts kicking. The action is bigger than ever. I was worried a bit with the bullet-proof super carts, but the tank is big time fun. And picking on Tyrese Gibson is so brilliantly enjoyable.",SnoopyStyle,"Feb 16, 2014"

7,About as dumb as big action flicks get. And quite a lot of fun as a result.,"At the end of part 5, the F&F crew split $100million between them; somehow, a share of that haul bought Roman (Tyrese Gibson) a lear jet, a luxury yacht and a penthouse apartment, with cash to spare. Talk about getting the most from your money. Still, this is one of the least unbelievable things in a film that doesn't just ask the viewer to suspend disbelief, but rather grabs them by the neck and demands that they do so or else.This chapter in the dumb but entertaining blockbuster franchise sees Dom (Vin Diesel) reassembling his crew to help special agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) stop an international criminal from obtaining the components to build a bomb that will be worth billions to the wrong people. To paraphrase one of the characters, it's some '007-type s**t', but taken to extremes, with action set-pieces that not only defy logic, but also the laws of physics.For some viewers, it will all be a step too far, although judging by the film's cumulative worldwide gross, this is exactly what many want in a summer blockbuster. Me? I fall somewhere in the middle: there are moments that are extremely well handled (Gina Carano's fist fight with Michelle Rodriguez is excellent); a few scenes are exhilarating popcorn nonsense that I cannot help but enjoy for their sheer audacity (the tank crushing cars on a Spanish highway); but others push credibility beyond even what I can accept in a silly summer action flick (the ridiculous finale on the world's longest runway).That said, I'd much rather watch this than another Michael Bay Transformers film.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for Carano (who should have nabbed the Wonder Woman gig instead of Gal Gadot).",BA_Harrison,"Jul 22, 2018"

6,"You get what you expect, as long as you don't expect much","Movies from the Fast and Furious franchise always bring up the same problem. If the cars are fast enough and the explosions are big enough, is the fact that there are uninteresting characters and a brainless story irrelevant? After all, people see these movies for the action, and in the case of Fast Six, it delivers handily. But newcomers to the Fast and Furious world that long for an intelligent story in their movies may want to stay as far away as possible, because the plot in Fast Six is a dud. What it all boils down to is that the most loyal devotees of the franchise will find lots to enjoy, but it won't be making many new fans either. This really is a shame, especially because last year's Fast Five made me a believer in a film series I had long thought had no sign of life.This isn't to say that the movie is terrible. In some ways it even exceeds Fast Five. Vin Diesel's (back as Dominic Toretto) stone-faced acting and deep monotone is an almost welcome sight at this point, as it has become a staple of the franchise; and Dwayne Johnson as Hobbs is as entertaining as ever. Like in all the Fast and Furious movies, the acting is best when the fists do the talking. The movie has some clever throwbacks to Johnson's wrestling days and just visualizing Vin Diesel's flying head-butt brings a smile to my face. An excellent call was made in casting Gina Carano as Hobb's partner Riley. She may have very few lines, but her fight scenes are incredible. If you haven't, see her in last year's Haywire which is tremendously underrated.The dialog, which has often inflicted this franchise like a plague, has been greatly improved this time around. Don't be fooled, it still isn't great, but the clichés and bad jokes have for the most part been eradicated. One of the most impressive amendments the film makes is the strength of the banter between the principle cast, which is among the most glaring issues with its predecessors. This is especially true in regards to the back-and-forth antics of Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Ludacris), both of which I had originally hoped they wouldn't bring back for this sequel. I was prepared to be annoyed by them, but was pleasantly surprised by their genuinely witty jokes. I also thought it was a smart move to not bring back every single character from the previous films. Fast Five was largely unsuccessful in juggling its many characters. This time, there's just the right amount of characters for the film to play with, so longtime fans needn't worry as most of their favorite characters are back and have more screen time.The problems with Fast Six are rooted in its story that defies logic and the absurd melodrama and pointless twists that accompany it. The plot reads as nothing more than a bad soap opera with Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) being brought back from the dead and suffering from amnesia. The amnesia ends up playing out solely as a vehicle for inconsequential drama with no regard to the actual affects amnesia would have. Equally outrageous, is the film's villain Shaw (Luke Evans), who is the antithesis to everything Toretto believes and stands for. His motivations are as unoriginal as they come and his actions are so questionable you wonder how this guy was so hard to catch in the first place. Let's not forget he also has his own ragtag team of criminals that mirror Toretto's. It's not a compliment. The film even refers to them (out loud) as their evil twins, so you know in true melodramatic fashion, they each have to fight their own counterpart in the climax. I really do wish I was making all this up.Far too often the film resides in sentimentality. Toretto constantly addresses how important his makeshift ""family"" is to him; a nice message for sure, but the constant reminders lessen the impact. In the film's most cringe worthy scene, Shaw argues the flaws of Toretto's belief, which begs the question of why he even cares. As is par for the course for the Fast and Furious movies, the characters have little depth. Only fans of the series can enjoy them, but only because they've been exposed to them for six films; it's merely a side effect.If you can stomach the bad, the movie can be very rewarding. After all, this is an action film, and that is what it does best. The film has more of the physics defying action that is so beloved in the Fast and Furious universe. Particularly, the two set pieces in the last forty minutes, which include a tank AND a plane, are worth seeing the movie for alone. It reminded me of why I liked Fast Five so much. Because the best parts of the movie are crammed in at the end, the rest of the film suffers as a result. It would have been better to see something more grandiose in the first ninety minutes that would grab my attention and hold it throughout the film, similar to Fast Five. I got the impression that after how over-the-top fun Fast Five's ending was, director Justin Lin felt that the only way to up the ante was to make everything bigger. But part of the joy of Fast Five's climax was how wonderfully original it was conceived. It is proof that bigger isn't always better.With all the highs and lows taken into account, Fast Six equates into nothing more than a noisy ""OK"". What is most frustrating of all is that after Fast Five injected some much needed energy into this lifeless franchise, that this one doesn't quite carry the torch. But with quite an intriguing cliffhanger (stick through the credits), I'm hopeful for next year's installment.",Engenius,"Jun 11, 2013"

Take a suggestion, leave your brain and facts at home and you'll have great time with this movie. Fast 6 well deserves 7.5/10",CaptKeshav,"May 27, 2013"
7,Ride or Die,"Review of Fast & Furious 6 http://www.yusufpoonawala.com/movie/fast-furious-6/ The gang is back,yet again. Fast 5 had taken this street racing franchisee to a new high and current series director Justin Lin, in what seems to be his last outing in this series, manages to say that elusive goodbyein style.This is pure adrenalin rush.The gang, living in early retirement after their 100mill heist in Fast 5, are reassembled by DSS Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and his partner Agent Riley (Gina Carano). Yes, its the cops asking the help of the thieves, since their latest case involves sophisticated thieves of a similar kind, but different class altogether. And the movie keeps on reminding us that class difference, repeatedly.",yusuf1976,"May 24, 2013"

9,Amazingly faster and more furious than ever,"From the first Fast & Furious these films has been a great success. At first OK and good entertainment, and undeniably a good idea. The second two was a let down with too much sideways driving, but then things started happening again. The fifth outing Fast Five was surprisingly the best so far. It WAS fast & furious! The pace was excellent, the story was good and the driving was amazing. This sixth outing adds a lot to the last success, which made 630 million dollars in the cinemas only. The world's biggest car film franchise!F&F6 which premiered in London a week before the rest, due to London being the base here, is ferociously faster and more furious than ever. The only thing that doesn't take off here, is the plane in the end! F&F6 is starring some of the most amazing sports cars classic car lovers adore. This time also European super-cars!The amazing British handmade Jensen Interceptor, the ultra rare Dodge Charger Daytona made in only 300 ex (though here in a replica) and the sporting legend of a every day classic, the Ford Escort RS2000 are tangled in together with the well known Mustang and Corvette. You'll also find a Plymouth Barracuda, a 2011 Dodge Charger, A Nissan GTR, BMW M5, Alfa Romeo and Aston Martin is also present. Put into the mix the most classic tank driving since James Bond drowned his in Russia, sadly enough crushing a Mustang, and you got a driving focused classic which is even better than the Fast Five!This is a continuation of Fast Five, and some kind of prequel to the first. Impressive action stunts, fast cars, sexy entertainment, well acted by the crew we've grown to like so much. Amazing driving action is the driving force of this film, containing a car chase on a long strip against a plane, and a long carcasses a city night. I love that Gina Carano is added to the crew. This is so right it can possible be. This seems to be an unstoppable success story, which will continue to bring classic drivers cars out of oblivion, making new fast for the old classics which should be preserved for the future in a world where cars are looking like bars of soap.As long as this franchise can keep up with the feel good action and showing the use of nasty cars and chic girls combined with an effective story which includes the classic car chases, this will deliver the thrills.What will be the cars in the seventh outing? I bet for a Monteverdi, most certainly a Maserati and a nice TWR. I'd sure love to see more of the Jensen Interceptor, so may I suggest a four wheel drive FF-battle between Jensen FF racing against a Ferrari FF? I suggest the name FF7 - Fast & Furious Four Wheel Drive!Don't leave the cinema too early. In an extra clip you'll get a little glimpse of what to expect in the next episode, and who's the obvious bad guy in this. Well, we just have to wait a year, because the seventh is on a year from now. Enjoy the rides! I sure did!",OJT,"May 13, 2013"

7,Action Overdose,"OK this film is worth watching, however the older you are the more you will be put off by the quantity of action in it.Everyone managed to have at least one worthy performance. Although some of the better actors managed to perform well throughout the entire film.For me the disappointment was with Bruce Willis and the quiet Chinese guy. They were the most unconvincing performances.Like bad roller coaster rides, the kind that do more than just excite/thrill you, by the end of the ride you feel sick and never want to go on it again. This also describes this film's viewing experience.If only they could beef up the script, tone down the action, stop putting in, so called ""cash magnet"" actors like Bruce Willis, (that really should retire.) Add some depth along with a more sophisticated soundtrack. They would have made a one-to-remember type film.I normally do not like ""the Rock"" however in this film he does one of his best and believable performances! I really liked Vin Petrol too, he was awesome in this film and I wish he would act in more credible titles. The guy that plays the baddie is very good, once again proving he is around to stay.Anyway all in all a good movie, one that requires zero brain power to process, yet not quite boring enough to send you to sleep half way through.Summary A cliché feel good action flick.Questions... Is it worth cinema viewing? - No; Is it worth buying? - No! Therefore wait until it is on the TV or hire it out when there are no more ""Big Titles"" left to watch. ;)",killgamers,"Jul 7, 2013"
5,I don't get how this and the previous installment were so well received. They're utterly stupid.,"A rare film that I saw in the theater and barely remembered I saw it just a few hours later. Honestly, I had no interest in it, was just with family over Memorial Day weekend and had a free ticket anyway. Still, what a waste of time. Who cares about the plot? Whenever the characters are talking between action sequences, it's pure torture. Who gives a crap what these people are saying? The action sequences themselves are somewhat amusing, but they aren't really that good. Too much editing, leading to occasional confusion. Physics are completely ignored. Momentum, inertia, gravity: fuhgetaboutit. When I watched the fifth F&F movie, which I did because it actually got very good reviews somehow, I thought to myself, eh, maybe I disliked it because I was watching it at home alone, which is clearly not the right environment. But hanging out with family and seeing the sixth one with an audience, yeah, I think they really do suck (though, truth be told, I remember enjoying the first one, which I saw on video with my brother when it came out).",zetes,"Jun 2, 2013"
7,Good movie dragged down by Hollywood stupidity,"This is a good movie. It is pretty much what you would expect from a Fast & Furious movie. It could have been a great movie but it is unfortunately dragged down by some of the not too unusual Hollywood stupidity and arrogance towards the viewers.Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson are perfect in their roles as old-fashioned, hard-hitting, fast-driving macho guys. Michel Rodriquez is doing a decent enough job as well but then I do like Michel Rodriquez so These guys are making a lot of the movie for me. The rest is not bad but more like filling out some empty space compared to Vin and Dwayne.This is of course a movie about fast driving, action and special effects. In those areas it does not disappoint. There are lots of fast driving and lots of action and special effects. Not all of it is entirely realistic of course. This is rather expected and I can live with it as long as it doesn't go to far into the realm of ludicrously unrealistic which it, sadly, did towards the end. Although the effects and fights themselves were quite cool the entire flight escape scene was just ludicrous. They were driving at take-off speed, both on the ground and in the air, for how long? 20 minutes? That must have been the worlds longest runway. This is what I call Hollywood arrogance towards the viewers. Do they really think the viewers are so stupid that they will just buy this? Or is it that they themselves are so utterly stupid that they do not realize how utterly wrong the entire thing is? For me this really dragged down an otherwise great movie.Otherwise the movie is a nice blend between macho talk, action, lots of fast driving, some humor, some more action, some more fast driving and lots of chars getting smashed. In short all the things that make up a good fun action movie. The story itself? Well, as far as I am concerned, fairly standard issue which held the action together reasonably although the basic idea and technical aspects, especially this ""EMP chip"", where not very believable.On the whole, it was a good and enjoyable movie which good have been great if it were not dragged down by Hollywood stupidity.",p-jonsson,"Apr 4, 2014"
7,"As if swanky cars weren't enough, Fast and Furious now have 'Tank' rampaging the roads—and, you are in for one hell of a ride!","Yipin (Justin) Lin nails another F&F movie. The 6th installment doesn't just pick the tempo where Fast 5 concluded; it gets bigger too, and straightaway—no lag on plot development or character insights as it is already all set. From scene one you have fast cars in action, trailblazing through some beautiful locales.F&F also provides what was amiss in Fast 5—a real villain of credibility in Shaw (Luke Evans), well supported by his sidekicks who match (even betters) Dom's crew blow-by-blow, i.e., until the climax of course.Action in the film, as it was supposed to, overshadows all other aspect of the film but comedy, overall acting, editing, camera work, special effects, etc. gel well in this in this high octane showdown.All in all, a perfect summer blockbuster for action buffs.If the sneak-peek of F&F is anything to go by then the F&F 7 is going to be even 'massiver'—the newest addition (current tycoon of action films) to cast/franchise certainly indicates so! What more. Being a huge fan of Diesel's 'Riddick', I hope the success of F&F avails him enough riches to decently market/promote another potent, niche-focused, action/adventure franchise of his.7.5/10",YasheshJ,"May 26, 2013"

8,Vin diesel and family bring a non stop thrill ride,"By now the Fast & Furious franchise was made in the eyes of Hollywood, following a massive box office haul for Fast Five, the picture that saw Justin Lin begin the transition from street racing car movie series to explosive action heist franchise, a transformation so many other series' would never be able to pull off five movies in. This one did and, remarkably, the films began to improve in quality - in that regard, Fast & Furious 6--arguably the most bonkers and joyously fun outing for the franchise to date--is the pinnacle of a series seemingly immune to the law of diminishing returns, where Vin Diesel, the late Paul Walker and their crew only seem to become more likable, more charming and more watchable as the franchise grows more confident, more explosive and more wonderfully insane by each film. This is the one where Lin, right from the off, lets everything off the chain - you'll be hard pushed to find anything made for the last few decades that's as gleefully, knowingly dumb, fun and exciting as Fast & Furious 6. For that, it's almost entirely a joy.What was originally known as Fast Six (a better title, arguably) was pre- visualised and written by Lin and series' writer Chris Morgan almost in tandem with the previous picture, hence that movie's post-credits reveal that Michelle Rodriguez's Letty was alive and well, and indeed seemingly had taken a dark turn, after apparently being blown to smithereens two films ago. Her reappearance sparks Diesel's gruffalo Dominic Toretto and his crew--now all freshly minted millionaires after their Rio heist in the last film--to this time team up with The Rock's badass DEA agent Hobbs in tracking down & bringing to heel the terrorist who seemingly has her captive - Luke Evans in full smarm mode as callous Brit-baddie Owen Shaw. Much like Joaquín de Almeida's limp drug baron in Fast Five, he's the villainous weak link here; Lin never much bothers to make him all that menacing and up against beasts of men like Diesel & The Rock, you need a strong villain. No matter because the picture has its eyes elsewhere - yes admittedly the attempts at injecting drama as Diesel monosyllabically tries to protect his 'family', but at the same time the humour and charm is plentiful amongst an ensemble who are very at ease with one another, nobody showboating to gain the limelight but all getting their moments in the spotlight. But forget all that, there's stuff that needs exploding and boy does Lin have fun there - be it a thrilling chase through London in souped up formula one heist cars, a truly insane freeway chase involving a runaway tank and an even more bonkers climactic plane sequence with the longest runway in movie history (honestly, it must be ten miles long!) and a series of fights that culminate in Diesel, literally, executing a flying headbutt. My girlfriend, a huge fan of Diesel and the franchise, admitted she didn't know whether to laugh or cheer. The simple solution is you do both, and Lin actively encourages it.While the end seems to resolve proceedings in a barbecue tinted bow, Fast & Furious 6 then unleashes a wonderful stinger of a post-credits sequence that not only resolve a bizarre continuity niggle (which has basically meant films four, five & six are effectively set before three weirdly) but tees up a thrilling and very recognisable menace for the next picture, which could possibly send a franchise already soaring with gleefully nonsensical and thoroughly enjoyable bravado into the stratosphere. The way it's heading, we are surely destined Fast & Furious 10 to see a geriatric Diesel & The Rock battling alien invaders orbiting the Earth. We can only hope.",Tyson14,"Apr 8, 2015"

9,Fast & Furious 6 Movie Review By Andrew Brauer,"It's crazy to see that this franchise has gone to a sixth entry, but what is even more surprising is that it's actually been getting better. The first four Fast & The Furious were pretty cheesy action movies that would cater to a certain demography, but when Fast Five came out in 2011, I was very surprised at how much fun I had with it, and If I did review movies back in 2011, that would've been on my Top 10 of Best for the year. Now two years later we have Fast & Furious 6, which takes place where Fast Five finished, Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew are living large as millionaires but Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) shows up and needs Dom's help, as a new group of criminals led by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) is after an important computer chip that could lead to a even bigger threat. But the big reason why Dom and his crew will help out, is because one of Shaw's right hand men is Dom's former lover Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) who died in one of the previous films, but turns out to not be dead. Dom, Brian, Roman, Tej, and everyone else returns to rescue Letty, and clear they're names for good. Now for starters, does this film have the greatest writing or acting in the world, of course not, but it is insanely fun and without a doubt one of the most entertaining films this year. This film is extremely well directed with Justin Lin (Fast Five) at the helm, the action sequences look incredible and every time something big and exciting was about to happen, I was pumped up and was giggling with excitement. In fact, the final action sequence is one of the coolest action scenes I've witnessed in a long time. The pacing is also quick and hardly slows down, whereas for the story is simple and hardly focuses on it, unless it involves the overall message about family and togetherness. Fast & Furious 6 has what was missing out of Pacific Rim, which the problem with Pacific Rim was too much story, not enough action, Fast & Furious 6 is all action, little story, and it works so well. The acting is fine, everyone has been doing these movies for a while so they know what their doing and they do it well. The humor is great as several times I cracked up (most of it is from the comic relief of Tyrese Gibson's Roman), the soundtrack is great, and although the writing is pretty silly, it does serve for some truly perfect quotes. Problems are that logic is thrown out the window for this film, if you think more than you watch, you'll just hate watching this because hardly anything makes sense. And some scenes around the middle go on a little too long, especially the prison scene. But Fast & Furious 6 is comfortable with what kind of film it is, a silly, over the top, but extremely entertaining crowd pleaser. I haven't this much fun with a movie in a long time, all you need to know is fast cars, hot girls, explosions, and muscles. Just leave your brain at home and enjoy the ride.",andrewbrauer96,"Nov 24, 2013"

9,Best In The Franchise,"It's so rare nowadays that sequels improve and franchises get better, well Fast & Furious shows us it's truth. This sixth addition lives up to it's speedy natured title yet again with furious action sequences that will excite audiences from the epic scale convoy heist to the knockout plane finale, it's all so over the top and that's exactly what you want. This addition spans the globe from the streets of London, the busy roads of Tenerife and back and forth from the USA. Justin Lin is the ultimate director for this franchise, he keeps every aspect sharp from the beautiful camera-work, the expertly crafted stunts to the fantastic character chemistry. The best thing about six is that it goes in a new direction, heading towards a more action drama, as the main focus is family, and the crew are closer than ever, and whenever a character is in peril you feel for them and you begin to hope everything turns out alright. The cast deliver fine performances, all of which are the best in the franchise, there's genuine chemistry and strong interaction, and when Mia is kidnapped you will gasp. Owen Shaw, played by Luke Evans, is hands down the best bad guy in the franchise, he's menacing, motivated and very sly and he aims at the protagonists weak spots, pushing their buttons resulting in fantastic face/offs. Gina Carano is back and better than ever, I last saw her in Haywire and she is still electrifying, super sexy and a spectacular fighter, the cat fights between her and Rodriguez are enough to stand up to the ground breaking force of the Rock and Vin Diesel. The story is tightly packed, the camera-work follows the pulse racing action and there are tonnes of shocks and twists, this is a top notch addition. Plus, the credits feature an epic-beyond-words cliffhanger that will leave you in awe, and ready for part seven.",JamesIan2021,"May 14, 2015"

7,The Best One Yet!,"Yes, I am aware of the fact I have written ""The Best One Yet!"" and only gave it a seven out of ten. Yes, I loved the movie but it did not exceed all my expectations. The length, well, it was very long. I wouldn't be bothered about the length but this film did not amaze me, and I wasn't prepared to see more. The plot. I liked it, but there was a flaw. Yes, it was about cars and racing, but unlike all the other ones, this had the least of it. It definitely shouldn't have been titled ""Fast and Furious 6"", it should be ""Chasing Shaw"", which includes a hint of cars, but the main idea of this film. The acting. It was good. But, it didn't make me feel like I was there, to be honest, I felt the only scenes that blew my mind were the very visual ones that included stunts, action, or humor, but otherwise I felt it was to..to self-centered on the plot, (MUCH different than what I expected) where the characters weren't able to do what they were meant to, and it made a big impact on the movie.In conclusion, Fast & Furious 6 was an outstanding film with some flaws that definitely effect my opinion, but yet I do encourage you to see the film yourself. Most people liked it much more than I did, and with the box office total just for the past few days, I think that you would like it as well as mostly everyone else.",jagsports01,"May 28, 2013"
7,Cars vs Planes:Dawn of repeatedly saying family.,"I've said it many times before, but one of the main reasons why the F&F movies failed to reach mass appeal before Fast Five was because of their villains. They were always forced to take on low end drug dealers and people who have little to do with their line of work; driving cars really fast and stealing things. With Fast & Furious 6, the team gets to take on Owen Shaw & his own crew, who are equally as good at doing crazy stuff on wheels.Dom regathers his team, including Brian, Han, Gisele, Roman, and Tej, after Hobbs comes to him with an offer he can't refuse. The chance to save Letty from Shaw and take him down, in exchange for full pardons all the way around. After quite a few films on the run and unable to return to his home in Los Angeles, there's no way he could turn down this opportunity, even if it meant going up against his former girlfriend thought dead, Letty. Fast & Furious 6 has even more muscle, explosions, faster cars, and just downright insanity. But it isn't as clean cut or polished as Fast Five. Granted, a movie like this doesn't necessarily need to have a concise story or developed characters, but they've done a much better job at doing those things within the last few films. The 6th film feels a little slower and maybe even a little too long, with the end product still putting a huge smile on my face. But when comparing the two, a second watch definitely exposes some of this film's minor flaws.The one thing this film, and pretty much all of the films since 4, is that each keeps topping itself. Just when you think they couldn't top stealing a vault and dragging across the streets of Brazil, they take down planes with cars. The tone deafness of the series is gone and the new breed of F&F is here to stay. The crazy thing is, you buy into all of it. I bought into the family from the beginning and I one-hundred-percent buy into the series embracing it's goofiness. The film also manages to implement more humor into the 6th film which is something the franchise has been missing. Or at least, humor that actually makes people laugh. I won't count those horrible attempts at humor in the 2nd film.What makes this film stick out his that it's the first time the crew gets to go up against an entirely new crew with the same set of skills. Luke Evans is great as Owen Shaw, The Rock has never been better, and who doesn't love watching Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson crack one- liners at each other. Better yet, every word out of Vin's mouth is a one-liner. Overall, the ante is once against raised and the series punches its way through another smash hit. Fast & Furious 6 is an insane thrill ride from the beginning to end.",ryanskywalker-87402,"Apr 20, 2017"
7,What I think of Furious 6,"It did not disappoint. If you are familiar with the franchise and who isn't. It's everything you come to expect. Just more of it. Not looking for no deep meaning, just fun. Some of the stunts are unbelievable but I expect spectacular from this franchise. I don't know how much longer they can keep it up and keep something that fans will spend their money for. I loved the comic relief. Hope there's more of that in the next movie. Good to know people are still making movies just for fun. Every film does not have to have social commentary just great cgi! Don't get me wrong there is a plot & a story. Same basically as all the others in the franchise and for subsequent movies in the Fast and Furious line.",alekitten1,"Sep 30, 2015"
8,What a great surprise!,"I'm a big fan of the Fast & Furious franchise, but since the last movie (Rio) i was like ""it's a good action movie, but it had lost its essence"". Now, after watching F&F 6, i've the feeling that one part of the original story is back. The cars have a bigger role (now they can be called secondary characters), but still isn't the same as F&F , F&F 2 and F&F Tokio. All the characters (specially Dom, Brian, Hobbs and Letty) were well created, respecting their origins and explaining some important details from the past movies. I've rated 8 for some reasons: 1) action sequences that goes against gravity in so many ways; 2) it's a little too long; 3) the cars and races still have a secondary role.In general it's a great action movie, with a good plot, nice races, really funny (thanks Roman!) and exciting. If you're a big fan of F&F, why haven't you watched yet?? If you're not a fan, but like action movies, i strongly recommend it!Hope this review helps!",lucena-neto,"May 25, 2013"
7,The coolest gang is back !,"Following Fast Five and its post-credit scene, this was the most hyped summer movie. And it did justify it somewhat, with me being edged to the seat throughout its 130 minute run.Its different from any other action series for having a gang that is family and has a code, primarily laid out by Dom. It increases its grip by nostalgic moments from its prequels (""We Own It"") and is incredibly fast (amazing action sequences). Some of it is non-realistic, but we won't term it as no-brainy. Yes it does have its weak moments, but it'll still be termed as 'Must Watch'.Though best movie in the series still remains the 2001 original, this is pretty awesome. Without revealing much, do enjoy this and whatever you do, don't leave your seat till the credits roll, believe me!",iamshauryataneja,"Jun 3, 2013"
8,Totally worth it! and gets you ready for Fast 7..,"Unlike other movie series, this movie wont disappoint you for a bit. Keeps you on the edge of the seat most of the time and at times takes you to totally relaxing mood, like coming back home.Action packed, fast paced with a touch of romance and giggles, Fast 6 opens up an entire new platform for explosive movies. Though you will find Vin Diesel getting older he still has got some good fights to enthrall you. Rock is as usual his best, you may wonder if he is just coming out of gym working out. There are 2 action sequences that you must not miss. And also the last 1 minute... and finally a piece of advice. Its one of the movies that you should not miss watching on the big screen, so don't wait for the DVDs/torrents to come out.

8,Kept me at the edge of my seat,"Although I'm not a hardcore fan of this franchise, I did watch all of its titles and frankly speaking this installment kept me at the edge of my seat for a good two hours of actions, except maybe for the somewhat lengthy and awkward but fortunately rare conversational scenes. I like the breath-taking and adrenaline rush of the 'unusual' car-chase scenes, which have already been revealed in the trailer, involving F1 cars, a tank and even a plane. As for the speed rush, you'll just have to watch it yourself. I also enjoyed the little bit of reminisce in classic scenes here and there, as well as some humorous scenes involving mostly Tyrese. Got to give it to him for the laughs.I don't mind the fact that there's more of Dwayne Johnson but I'm actually quite disappointed with Paul Walker's underplayed role. Vin Diesel could also use a bit more facial and non-verbal expressions. Overall I find it as one of the best installment of the franchise, and definitely a good watch if you're a typical action flick fan. 8 from me as it certainly tops my action movies list of the year, but pretty straight-forward and not quite yet to reach a 'legendary' status that movies like The Matrix and Rambo enjoys.Oh and special credits to the production team for the bridge scene and the teaser for the next installment (remember to stay seated when the credit starts to roll!)",tzmmalaysia,"May 27, 2013"
7,The sixth film has arrived!,"Fast & Furious 6 is the sequel to Fast Five (2011) and the sixth installment of the FAST & THE FURIOUS franchise. This film was in development by February 2010 as the first film in the series to move away from the underground car-racing theme of the previous films in the series which was considered to have placed a barrier on audience numbers. The film was released on May 24th, 2013 and grossed over $780 million dollars worldwide.The plot follows Dominic Toretto and his crew who has retired following their successful heist in the fifth film, but remain wanted fugitives until they return to the USA at the end of this film. USS Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs offers to clear their records and allow them to return home in exchange for helping him to take down a skilled mercenary organization led by Owen Shaw, one member of which Toretto's presumed-dead lover Letty Ortiz. They save Letty, but Mia is kidnapped by Shaw's team and this leads into a super-intense conclusion.The story is really well-thought out, but there are a few flaws but that does not stop this movie from being really good. Some of the dialog does not make any sense, but some of the jokes and dialog by the cast makes a lot of sense in some of the movie really cool. A few lines are also really quotable lines especially with our main antagonist when he reminds Dom and the crew saying, ""This code you live by, is the very reason why you weren't even in the game."" The action is a little over-the-top but it stills keeps me interested. However, the second car chase in the middle of the film was way too destructive in this film, but I really liked it though. But did you really had to try and kill Letty by throwing her off a tank? No. I will admit, the ending 12 or 14 minute climactic car-chase sequence is pretty awesome with a mix of CGI, pre-visualization, stunt work and live-action footage.The acting is a little confusing, but I will give credit to our main actors: Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner, Dwayne Johnson as Luke Hobbs, Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz, Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto, Sung Kang and Gal Gadot as Han Seoul-Oh and Gisele Yashar, Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous as Roman Peace and Tej Parker and of course, Elsa Pataky, Chris Hemsworth's real life wife, as Elena Neves. They all do a good job. John Ortiz returns as Braga and he does a good job, but he is only in the prison scenes. Gina Carano plays Riley and she does a great job as a villain, at the end, but even then she's a mixed-martial arts fighter and her performance is over-the-top in a few areas, but she keeps me interested in her character until she is killed by Letty.Our villain is British newcomer, Luke Evans as the role of Owen Shaw, the brother of the next villain, who is revealed as Han's killer at the end of this film in a post-credits scene that sets up FURIOUS 7 fantastically as the evil Deckard Shaw, who calls Dominic with a threatening message: ""Dominic Toretto, you don't know me. But you're about to."" The music is composed by Lucas Vidal and I am confused because I like Brian Tyler's musical score for the other films in the series, even Furious 7. I don't like half of Vidal's score, but I am glad some of Brian Tyler's music is present in this film.Also, I am very sad to see Gisele die. That part when Gal Gadot's character sacrifices herself to save Sung Kang's character, Han was a little bit over-the-top. Also, we see Han die again and this was shown in Tokyo Drift, the third Fast and Furious film, that was released in 2006.So, overall, with FAST SIX or FAST & FURIOUS 6, I both love it and hate it. The movie does a few things right, but the whole idea of kidnapping Mia was a little bit crazy, but this is FAST and FURIOUS, so I'll give credit to the director Justin Lin and writer Chris Morgan for coming up with a great climax. I give it a 7.9 out of 10. It's not the best Fast and the Furious film ever, but it could have been a hell of a lot worse. And I do mean worse, I'm referring to the fourth film, simply titled Fast and Furious, which was released in 2009.",joshuadrake-39480,"Apr 23, 2015"

Quit after you've sucked every golden egg from the tired golden goose until you kill it might be the creators of Fast and The Furious philosophy.I truly think that some die-hard fans are so fooled by there own limited views that they really think this thing is a good film. The sad thing is that they really believe the nonsense they are peddling. More's the pity. Apparently, they'd rather lie to both you and to themselves. If your thought process is child-like and you're not very intelligent, you may find Fast and Furious 6 to your liking but even then I have my doubts.Awful at every turn.",megaknocker,"Jun 22, 2013"

7,Perfect Recipe for a summer blockbuster,"Great sequel and the best series ever. And the good thing, there is more to come. I hope the creators of this movie franchise keep up the good work, they have been doing. This movie franchise works on the formula of - Fast Cars, Hot Girls, Fast Action, Grey shaded Characters, Comedy. But since the FF5 movie, something changed. Things got bigger and better. Dwane Johnson joined the crew. And what a boost he gave to this franchise. Dwane and Vin Diesel, face to face was awesome. Also the main attention in the movie has shifted to action scenes involving huge vehicles and environments. Sometimes unbelievable, but 100% enjoyable. Also the level of special effects has improved. Also the background music and songs are good. Perfect time-pass movie.",alexander-khalkho,"Nov 8, 2013"
7,"Just for entertainment, nothing more","There is nothing I could say about ""Fast and Furious 6"" besides a fun movie with dumb storyline. I must admit that the action scenes in this movie is bigger and cooler than other previous series but in storyline, ""Fast Five"" is much better. ""Furious Six"" undeniably has more action sequences, car crashing and bigger explosions which is fun to see in the summer season. It's what all ""Fast and Furious"" fans expected to be. Besides that massive action stuff, there's nothing left you could expect from this movie. The quality of storyline is so bad and dumb that makes this movie goes nowhere and no different from their previous franchise. The more you think, the more you feel silly about this movie. For example, the scenes when Brian pretending goes to jail for searching information about Letty that even their team and Toretto himself had already known about it before Brian told them, so what does he go to jail for? The cast in ""Furious Six"" are also flat and standard. As Indonesian people, I'm really proud of Joe Taslim for his first Hollywood movie debut. I know that he doesn't speak much but it's just enjoyable to see him fighting and taking quite important role. Overall, ""Furious Six"" is kind of good movie to see this summer and one of the great one from the series. But if you're searching for a good quality movie with strong storyline, it's not that kind of movie.",aldri-feb,"May 23, 2013"
9,Number 6 is a Winner,"You probably think most reviewers gave this film high marks because of Paul Walker's sudden death soon after it's release, but that is not the case, it is a great film. Maybe not as good as Fast Five, but number six does have a good story.However, it is unfortunate that Paul Walker died so suddenly, because the future of the franchise will ultimately be different. It really won't be the same. Especially since his character is explored so much in this film, becoming a father and having a family. I won't go too far into that though.The cliffhanger ending makes you really want to see number seven, as it is the penultimate film in the series, revolving around story-lines that also include those in Tokyo Drift. Like what happened to Han? And what will become of Dom and Brian? Guess we will see the answers to those questions on April 3, 2015. See you there.",Hollywood_Yoda,"Feb 6, 2015"

8,Brainless.... but so much fun,"This movie must be one of the most brainless movies I ever saw in cinemas, along with the expendables that is. However it was just so much fun.What makes the Fast and the Furious so great is without a doubt the incredible team that is behind this series. It must be said there isn't much of a story in this installment of the series. However after having seen five brainless fast and the furious movies one does not expect a strong storyline. The really lovely thing about this movie is that the viewer really can see how the actors actually must have had a great time shooting this film. As in the previous movie there is a great cooperation between Vin Diesel and The Rock, now teaming up in one of the greatest bad-ass end battles in movie history.But also the character of Roman gives an extremely witty feeling to this movie. As said it is not the immense stunts, the incredible special effects or the beautiful soundtrack that makes this movie, it is simply the great acting team behind this movie that makes it so entertaining.A must see for every fan of action, comedy and just pure entertainment.",Goodfellasz,"Feb 1, 2014"

8,Contains what we loved from the first movies....Street racing!,"After many years, won't the ""Fast and Furious"" makers give up the series. They have always wanted to keep their fans close and updated, by making more movies. The problem by making more movies to a series, is that they always have to bring something new to the movie. They get fewer new ideas, and end often by ""copying"" another movie from the series and make it a bit different. Those movies get hated and sells bad. But in the 6th movie of the ""Fast and Furious"" series, they give us something old and new, and it's exciting at the same time. In the 5th movie there were more action and a lack of street racing. In the 6th movie they've tried to go back to the street racing, and they succeeded! I felt like I was back in the first movies, the cars, the noises, hell yeah even the chicks were back! They even tried to combine both street racing and the action, WHICH was not a disappointment at all! The story is simple, stop the bad guys from doing something bad, but even if the story is that simple, it's pretty good told. There is always something that happens that will keep you focused. The effects are really great. There is nothing that is half done. Every actors and actresses play their roles excellent, especially hilarious Tyrese Gibson and the leading Vin Diesel.In short, the movie is great! I will recommend it for everybody that loves a good action movie, and for those who are big fans to the ""Fast and Furious"" movies. This movie is something you definitely should see.8/10",sander123-548-869941,"May 25, 2013"

3,Utterly Ridiculous,"I'm sorry, but suspension of disbelieve is not possible for me with this movie. There's only so far you can stretch a rubber band before it snaps, and with this movie, they stretched the rubber band about a hundred times past snapping point and expect the audience to believe it won't snap.Take the scenes (yes, plural) involving the plane near the end of the movie. After it had achieved takeoff speed, it was still struggling to take off for the next, what, 15 minutes? Was that run strip really 50 miles long? Note I didn't time the sequence, so my numbers might be off, but that's just an example of the extent of the ridiculousness. I don't give it a spoiler, because part of this was in the trailer I saw.Besides the ridiculous overly exaggerated action scenes, I thought the acting left much to be desired.It would, though, make a good video game.",brillig-2,"May 29, 2013"
7,Furious entertainment unleashed by cars and stars,"You won't queue up for it's first show. You won't gather a group of 10 friends to go watch it on Saturday evening. You won't spend extra on 3D and IMAX ever on this series but you will surely buy some popcorn because 'Fast and Furious' is one of the most entertaining franchises ever. By now, you know what to expect in terms of some sizable destruction of cars and assets, stunts that defy laws of physics and the scorching pace at which you can drive through densely populated cities. None of which is possible in reality but yet, there is something about this group that makes you want it to be real. Justin Lin has directed 3 of the more memorable F&F movies and this time too, he gets the combination accurately with just the right amount of hot women, sexy cars and high octane action. Buckle up for this fun ride. The opening sequence seems like a James Bond movie with a Dodge Challenger and Nissan Skyline racing along the Spanish coast, reflecting the carefree lives of now millionaires, Dominic and Brian. Shortly thereafter, Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) surprises Dominic with a visit and a motive (Letty lives!) to join forces to crackdown on Owen Shaw (Luke Evans)'s mercenaries who have performed a series of audacious heists to assemble a devastating weapon. Hobbs attempts to re-unite the team to take on Shaw on the street level and win full pardons for their past crimes. The action proceeds onto London's streets with Dom and Brian in hot pursuit of Shaw's mercenaries. Thereafter, Dom and his blast from the past, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) scorch the streets of London in an epic race that leads to the revelation that she survived the explosion a few movies ago but lost her memory. Shaw was the one who rescued her and hired her as his top mercenary. Following such an emotionally pleasing scene, we move on to Spain where the components of the Nightshade device are being transported to a secure location but the convoy is brutally attacked by Shaw's forces who also tear through the oncoming traffic in a tank along the highway. The team defy the laws of physics, create more destruction than some Decepticons and save each other in the name of being a family. The climactic action is on a never-ending military runway with the massive bomber aircraft being kept on ground by a handful of super-cars and heroes. The inaneness of the action is jarring but the actors make it all entertaining by giving their best in every ridiculous scene. One can also credit Lin for reviving these characters in 'Fast Five' and adding some richness to their bond to make us feel for them every time they defy physics. Justin Lin's fourth F&F venture is a super-charged engine aptly titled 'Furious 6' for it takes action, storyline, characterization and vehicular warfare to a higher level. As ridiculous as they may sometimes be, the sequences are bigger and more explosive with actors partaking in most of them. Hundreds of cars are sacrificed in the devastation that follows this team in their pursuit of Shaw and in their journey, we are given a better insight into their characters. When your expectations for a silly engine revving franchise are modest, the cars and humans can provide quite a rush of entertainment. Dwayne Johnson looks like the Hulk. He can only fit into army grade vehicles including the Hummer now but with G.I.Joe and F&F franchises, he's made his mark in the genre as the massive Rock of action. Vin Diesel's career is all about Dominic Toretto now. With few dialogues and more stunts, his talent is optimized by this franchise. Paul Walker could've been an unknown were it not for his partnership with Diesel in their car chases. With fewer dialogues and subtle emotions of being a father, Walker does justice to his role and no more. Michelle Rodriguez is badass in this film. Apart from some MMA fighting with Gina Carano, Letty also gets to shoot and drive some while her character gets a grasp of her past and present. Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous are funny but limited in exposure on screen. Luke Evans poses as quite a formidable villain, but we do not get to see much of his ruthless aggression since most of it is manifested in the manner of tanks and flip cars that create the destruction. Oh and please bring Gal Gadot back.... please.With some crazy car chases in London and physics defying sequences in Spain and the airstrip, Fast & Furious 6 packs quite a few horses to satiate the enthusiast. The plot is typical and is played out in banal fashion with occasionally cheeky dialogues. But that's not the point of this franchise. It's the super-cars, women, action and hip hop music that the protagonists roll out to in the drag race arena that will bring you back for more.... Speaking of which, there's a nice cliff-hanger to F&F 7 after the end so remain seated with the belts still on.7.853 on a scale of 1-10.",kunalkhandwala,"Jun 1, 2013"
6,"It is what it is - 5,9/10","Fast & Furious 6, what can I say? I mean, my expectations were really low and boy were they met. I'm not saying the type of low like ""This is going to be bad"", more like ""Hmm, I might give this a shot"". The director Justin Lin doesn't try to do anything else other than sticking to the trashy film that it is, and I would give him and the movie credit for that. But more? Nope, I think people are giving it too much credit for that. Sure, there were some ""good"" trashy action set-pieces in there, some muscle(cars), a tank, big guns, and... Nothing more. Maybe Vin Diesel flying across a very big gap between two bridges to save Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and landing on a car breaking the laws of physics - why? Because ""She is family, and family stick together, you don't turn your back on them even if they do"", or something. One thing maybe worth mentioning are the physical performances by everyone in the movie, especially the ladies.Everything ""good"" that was in the movie was already in the trailer, so what I ended up doing was just waiting for the scenes to pass by. There was a sequence in it where they had to drive after an airplane, and then they actually brought it down with some hooks and whatnot. That sequence goes on for about 15 minutes, which means that the runway must've been very, very long. And of course after that sequence they get to the end of the runway. A lot of innocent people also died in the scene with the tank (where it just runs over random cars with unimportant people in them).A lot of people did laugh, and they laughed a lot. The only thing that made me chuckle was probably The Rock himself just him being there. The only time I actually laughed was when the title ""Furious 6"" (If you have seen the movie you'll know which one I mean) came up because some guy in the back shouted ""6 Furious"". And I am not joking when I tell you that it was the only time during the movie that I actually laughed.This movie left me very uninterested and bored because of the plot, story, badly written characters and the dumb dialogues. I couldn't enjoy the big action set-pieces because I was so bored. So in general, this is a boring movie in every kind of way. And the fact that people in the audience gave a it big round of applause after the movie ended just made me wanna stick my head in the sand.",yaldish,"May 24, 2013"

9,Fantastic movie from an almost died-out franchise,"We've all seen our favorite movies churn out those forgettable and often straight-to-video sequels; Death Race, Wrong Turn, Resident Evil. (Really, not Resident Evil???). And with The Fast and the Furious series, you were starting to see the decline after 2 and most definitely 3. So for Justin Lin to bring back this series from the dead, even to use the weird sequels as a part of the story in his new trilogy, is incredibly impressive.As for Furious Six, I thought it was incredibly enjoyable. Few movies are actually this fun to watch. The action felt very well paced, never dragging on or repetitious in any way. The dialogue was humorous and the story was very interesting to see played out.I feel like the only movie I could compare this to is Transformers 3. Coming from a series that I felt like was convoluted and ""missing the point"" of a fun action film, Transformers 3 and Furious Six alike really meet what they were striving for. An incredibly fun film.This next part is mainly for people who have seen the movie already, though not a spoiler.I've seen a few reviews that say that last action packed scene in the film's climax was too much and could have been cut. I could not disagree more. I feel like the filmmaker mislead everyone to think everything was fine and dandy, all wrapped up, but I could not help but feel that the action was over too abruptly, and I still needed to see more. And then there is that last, incredibly epic action scene. The filmmakers made me feel like I needed to see more, so that they could deliver that last scene specifically for me. Great filmmaking, great film. Very impressed.",Ginnysababe,"Jun 9, 2013"
7,Lots of action but too much punching and kicking,This is a grand and extravagant looking production. The exotic locations are good. The car vs car action is what you'd expect and doesn't disappoint. Things go even further with tanks and planes. The car race in London was a bit artificially sped up. Who knew tanks could drive so fast. The attempts at humor are weak and mostly unfunny. But who care if some things are unreal thats part of the charm.Sadly the cast has aged. Paul is looking older = needs to stay out of the sun. Vin looks a little flabby. The Rock looked a bit too pumped up. Doesn't he know steroids are out now. The long drawn out obsession with Michelle Rodriguez's character is a bit tiresome. Jordanna is looking a bit gaunt. Luke Evans as the villain is a bit forgettable.Can there be too much action in a movie like this? In a way yes. The punching and fighting has come to equal the vehicular action. Enough of the fighting and punching back and forth! I know they had to use Gina Carano's skills but it felt like overkill. You can see that in any other action movie. Felt like a Hong Kong action flick.Overall things are quite grand and large scale especially looking back to the earlier ones in the series. Worth a watch.,phd_travel,"May 30, 2013"

7,Every sequel has been a little better than the last!,"'FAST & FURIOUS 6': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The sixth installment in the ever-popular action movie franchise brings back all the stars from the previous films including Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Paul Walker, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Sung Kang, Jordana Brewster, Gal Gadot and even Michelle Rodriguez (who's character was killed off two films ago). MMA champion (and rising female action star) Gina Carano (of 'HAYWIRE' fame) and Luke Evans also join the cast this time around. Justin Lin (who directed the last three sequels as well) returns as director and Chris Morgan (who wrote the last three installments) returns as the film's writer. This chapter has DSS agent Luke Hobbs tracking down Dominic Toretto and his team to enlist the gang's help in bringing down a team of deadly mercenary drivers. Toretto reluctantly agrees to help Hobbs when he discovers his old love, he thought was dead, is still alive and working with the team of mercenaries. The film is of course bigger and more action packed than ever and delivers everything die-hard fans of the series have come to expect.The movie begins with Dom (Diesel), Brian (Walker) and the rest of the car racing crew living around the world, on the lam, while spending the $100 million loot they scored in their Rio heist (at the end of the last film). Hobbs (Johnson), now working with his new partner Riley (Carano), tracks down Dom and convinces him to help him capture a team of mercenary drivers led by an ex-British Special Forces soldier named Owen Shaw (Evans). Hobbs offers Dom and his team full pardons if they help him stop Shaw but it's the info that Dom's ex-love Letty (Rodriguez) is still alive that persuades him into doing the job. Action and carnage ensue.I was never a huge fan of the original 2001 hit but I've liked each sequel a little more ever since (although I still haven't seen 'TOKYO DRIFT'). I think the franchise got a lot better with the last chapter when it added 'The Rock' into the mix. That's when box office for the series really skyrocketed and it also reached it's critical acclaim peak; how many movie series can one say that about (I can't think of any). It's great that this film added Carano as well and they also add another big action star at the end, in a post-credits scene, that should build even more anticipation for the next film in the series (which is already planned for next year). The franchise is still just a series of brainless action scenes strung together with no real plot or involving character development but they do keep getting more and more spectacular. This film does have some amazing car chases once again (including one involving a tank) but it still couldn't top the best car chase of the year (or just about any year) from another long running action movie franchise: 'A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD'.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge23zs5RPrM",Hellmant,"May 29, 2013"

No rating,vertigo thrilling stronger sequel,"pretty good movie that would force you to sit straight and upright through the whole nine yards when it played on. yes, rarely a title possessed franchise could be this good, there were TV episode-like movies like 007 or mission impossible, but some of them just felt weak, either affected by weak screenplays, bad directors or newly replaced main characters, but fast and furious seems to not only be able to maintain the quality of each one, it is actually getting better and better. the last Brazilian heist was a rarely accomplishment with bolder and crazier scenario but turned out to be very thrilling. if you think dragging and pulling a huge bank vault around citywide in a firefight is crazy, watch this new one, tank, cargo plan, fast cars....you might need to take some tranquilizers to calm down your nerves and resettle your blood pressure after you back home from the theater. and again, you'll see some highly unlikely scenes in this movie like any other fast and furious movies: after digged a Russian made high power military standard bullet out of his right front should-chest area, the guy never needed to recuperated and didn't need any blood infusion, just wrapped up and beating his opponents like nothing happened. an at least over several tons super tank could drive as fast as all the fast cars and crashed them like eggs. the high speed of the tank on the freeway was some scene that i simply could not believe at all. then the firefight on the runway inside a cargo plane. well, since it carried out so over-the-top crazy, i have nothing to say no more. this is indeed a crazy movie but nobody won't dislike it.",rightwingisevil,"May 19, 2013"

""The Family"" has gotten increasing big (but at least they get rid of a few characters for this film) and the themes haven't changed (which makes it all a bit dull and predictable) and the best thing about this film is Tyrese and Ludicrous (whom seem to get all the best lines). As much as I love Luke Evens, he's wasted in this film as is The Rock (who is in true supporting character mode). I wasn't impressed with any of the action sequences (except for maybe the tank sequence as that was the most entertaining sequence in the entire film). I can't even say that through all the blandness that the cast was pumped and energize as most of them seemed to be phoning it in.

7,The Best Fast & Furious Yet!,"Never have been a fan of this series, but after seeing the trailers and hearing some positive things, I decided to give this one a shot. And ya know what? I actually had a pretty fun time. I like the direction Justin Lin took with this one just making it big and stupid, but totally self-aware of what it is. The action set-pieces are an absolute blast to watch with each one topping the previous one before it. The last 2 scenes are worth the price of admission alone. I also enjoyed the chemistry between all the actors which added a surprising amount of laughs to the film. Still, the film has plenty of flaws that the series has shared. There is a bit too much down time in the middle where the film starts to drag when it begins to build on it's incredibly thin story. There's also some moments of dialogue that are so poorly written it's hard not to notice them. Overall, while it's not great by any means, I would defiantly say that this is my favorite of the series so far (although that's not saying much). Nothing special or all that memorable, but as a summer popcorn flick, it gets the job done. Fans of the series will most likely love it while even the non-fans will still be able to have some fun with it. I do have to admit though after the post-credit scene, I would be lying if I said I wasn't incredibly excited for the 7th installment!",Rebel_With_A_Cause_94,"Jun 1, 2013"

7,Fast and Furious 6 (Film Appreciation),"Car chases, car wrecks, fight scenes, and down-shifting is director Justin Lin's Fast and Furious sequels. Hobbs (Johnson) has a case that deals with Letty (Rodriguez) who is suppose to be dead and the love of Dominic Toretto (Diesel). Hobbs goal is to track down Letty's leader, Owen Shaw (Evans), who has a device that can cause widespread destruction. Toretto's goal is to find Letty and bring her back home to her family that includes: Brian O'Conner (Walker), Roman (Gibson), Han (Kang), Gisele (Godot), and Tej (Bridges). There are a lot of action and comedic moments that make the movie very entertaining. There are many fight scenes that are unrealistic and hard to believe events could actually happen. Overall Fast and Furious 6 is a very entertaining movie that held your attention throughout the entire movie.",bigeflockhart51,"May 29, 2013"

7,One of the best F&F with good story,"Summery : This is one of the best movie in series.It was all about cars. This time, it is not just cars, it's more on speed with less cars. Story is nice to make you seat. Movie is quite fast with some mix action. Some fight scenes made realistic but some are not. Anyway, at few things you think about how could they do it ? But they are doing it.All the cast and crew have worked great. Action sequences are awesome, breathtaking. Plot is good & keeps you with it.Why watch: This movie is not about cars as I said before. It has a story. Really good actionWhy not: It's an entertainment with hardly at few places you think it's not possible or why they ? For that I won't say anything about story, you must watch it.Overall: 7/10",phadvijayanand,"Jul 7, 2013"
8,My Personal Favorite Fast Film,"Fast and Furious 6 is my favorite film in this franchise thus far. I will say I enjoyed it even more than Fast Five. While Fast Five, from a critical standpoint, is better I had a bit more fun with this film. It is amazing to see where this franchise has gone throughout the years. This franchise went from films about street racing to straight-up action and adventure films, starting with Fast Five. Some people might not care for the change but I, personally welcome it. This film continues in that direction and I found it to be the most entertaining. There is nothing deep about this film. This film will not win any awards but it is not supposed to. This film, as well as the other Fast and Furious films, is meant to entertain, and I think it definitely succeeded.The cast from the previous films all reprise their roles here. The characters are all still enjoyable and play off each other very well. I love the banter between the characters. I thought this film had some of the best comedy of the series.Unlike the previous films, this film feels more like Vin Diesel's movie. In the first two films Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) was definitely the main protagonist. In Fast and Furious and Fast Five I felt Paul Walker and Vin Diesel were dual protagonists. Here Toretto feels more like the main protagonist. I do not mind this because of the plot of this film and because I like Toretto better than Brian anyway. I especially like his scenes with Letty. Brian is still important though, and goes through his own arc as well.Letty, played by Michelle Rodriguez, is back in this film. The way they explain how she survived in Fast and Furious, I thought was lame and implausible. However, she does have more to do in this film. In the first film she was one of the side cast and did not do much. In Fast and Furious she was only in the opening. However, in this she is given more screen time, more to do, and a pretty decent in the middle and end of the film. The scenes she shares with Toretto I liked as well.The villain Shaw I really like in this film. He's easily one of the stronger villains. This is probably because he has so little competition. The Fast franchise's main problem was its villains. The villains have always been weak and uninteresting. Shaw, I think is a big step up. I like that they make Shaw the antithesis of Toretto and his code. The incorporation of Letty makes this a very personal story for Toretto like Fast and Furious, which I like.The action is very loud, fun, and intense like in Fast Five. The effects are great too. There is CGI, but I think it is used effectively. Like in the last film, this film puts more emphasis on action and gun fights rather than racing. However, there are still one or two races that are incorporated, which I found to be enjoyable. Since my theater only shows movies in 2D, I cannot comment on the 3D aspect of the film.Overall, this was a great time at the movies. If you are a fan of the Fast Franchise, definitely check this one out. The ending scene during the credits was also amazing. Like Fast Five it won't win any awards but, for what it is, it's at the top of its class as far as action movies today.",mitchell5954,"Aug 17, 2019"
6,The Vidiot Reviews,"Fast & Furious 6The best way to curb street racing in your community is to generate constant gridlock.Mind you, the racers in this action movie are inclined to go off-road.Dominic (Vin Diesel) comes out of hiding to help DSS agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) stop a rogue solider (Luke Evans) from selling an EMP on the black market.In exchange, he and his crew (Paul Walker, Gal Gadot, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Tyrese Gibson, Chris Bridges) want amnesty for their US crimes and the freedom to return home.The fifth sequel in the series, Fast 6 doesn't dazzle like its predecessor Fast 5 but it does maintain the franchise's new espionage angle.And while street racing takes a back seat in this one, there are enough overblown car- chases, unexpected cameos and sudsy melodrama to propel the series onward.But, as always, this series ignores the real victims of street racing: ran-over flag-girls.

6,Good Fun,"Fast & Furious 6 is a perfectly enjoyable film with some laughs and spectacular action set pieces. Despite being completely ridiculous in some spots, especially the long climax scene. But in spite of this, the film is satisfyingly entertaining and at times thrilling. The performances from all of the cast are good , if a little hammy in places. Some of the banter between Chris Bridge's and Tyrese Gibson's characters gave the film some comic moments. Fast 6 doesn't live long in the memory but it's good fun while it lasts , despite being a tiny bit too long.Overall this is a solid entry into the fast & Furious franchise that will keep you entertained throughout.6/10",ginga145,"Jun 14, 2013"
6,Bring back the nostalgia,"The original F&F1 sparked the import scene in North America, with at the time seemingly accurate depictions of street cars and performance modifications. The movie was a car film in and out and as another user stated each movie has been getting progressively worse, this evident with the sixth instalment of the fast and the furious.Fast and the furious movies need Performance import cars that the common man can relate too, anything else could be lacking and the film would be just as nostalgic as the first movie. It really is sad to see where it came from and where it is now, I will not be watching the seventh if that so happens and I advise everyone from doing the same. Unless you couldn't give two flux about cars then watch it for Vin diesels boobs and a bullshit storyline.Bring back the nostalgia and RIP Paul Walker.",loganbentley,"Dec 10, 2013"
6,Not as good as the previous...,"When I saw the ""Fast Five"" movie I thought and expected that ""Furious 6"" was going to be a better movie than that, but it was not. And that's because this movie far surpassed some ordinary things that in all of ""The Fast and the Furious"" movies happened and I mean things with cars and not only.I have to say that in this movie seemed bad (not say ugly) not all but some of it the visual effects which were used on it. I like visual effects but when they used in moderation and not in a hole movie.Finally I want to tell you that in ""Fast Five"" I liked the interpretations of Paul Walker (Brian O'Conner), Dwayne Johnson (Hobbs) and Sung Kang (Han).",Thanos_Alfie,"Nov 19, 2013"

7,Enjoyable mayhem,"Keeping up the momentum from the previous film, the sixth film in the Fast & Furious saga sees the return of Brian (Paul Walker) and Dom (Vin Diesel) as they're once again pulled into doing a job. This time to save Dom's supposedly dead girlfriend, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez). And I have to say, it's good to have her back.Pretty much everyone from the previous film is back, which means that the dream team is still holding strong and this film continues to build their bond together. Both one on one and as a team. And it's easily the best part of the film.Furthermore, it's still a Fast & Furious film. Meaning fast cars, hot chicas, good music and great action scenes. The fifth film took the action in this franchise to a much grandiose direction and this film keeps up the trend. And I have to say that I love it. The first few films were fine for what they were, but these last few films have simply been in a class of their own.As for the villain, played by Luke Evans, I have to say that he could have been better. Evans is a talented actor and I've seen him pull off some really impressive characters, but this time he swung and missed. Part of that is the writing, no doubt. I'd actually go as far as three fourths. But some of that is on Evans as well. I simply didn't find him that threatening.Still, if you've liked the franchise so far, this is more of the same goodness.",Vartiainen,"May 18, 2020"

It had everything that you associate with this franchise. Even they part where the throw physics out the window!!! It starts out with Dom and O'Connor in there retreat in Spain when Hobbs come to ask Dom for help in bringing down a bunch of highly coordinated street races cum thieves. He also shows Dom a recent photo of Letty so that he just cant turn down the offer. From the streets of London to an army base in Spain. Its one roller coaster ride of fast cars.. incredible action sequences... A couple of girl on girl fights which were pretty awesome by the way.Total entertainment guaranteed.",sriramsrinivasan91-314-830752,"Dec 27, 2013"

9,***k yeah that's the way its done baby !!,"Wen you have Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson in the same movie and the whole audience goes nuts when these two figures arrive, its safe to assume the movie is hit. And yes it is.Leave performances, Ludicrous got the cheesiest of lines and man I almost laughed my heart out. Paul Walker, Sung Kang, Tyrese Gibson, Michelle Rodriguez and rest of the cast fits in perfectly.The antagonist of the movie keeps up to our expectations of being a complete bad-ass. The movie has its fair shares of twists and turns and the car chases and chick fights really keeps you glued to your seats.The post warning and before the credits roll out,the cut scene has a delightful surprise. Better watch for yourself. Just the one complaint, the time line of the movie has put me in a doubt and people who have seen and remember Tokyo Drift are going to agree with me. Cheers.

6,"""Ride or die, remember?""","FILM : 6.0
Rewatching the 2013 film Fast and Furious 6, I find myself with mixed feelings. Ugh. Just when things were heading in the right direction. Justin Lin sure knows how to make entertaining films, but the constant escalation of action pushes things so far past the point of realism that you think you're watching a Marvel film.Here we have Dom, Brian, and Co. Doing crazy stuff with tanks and planes which defies all reality. In the first film, it was a struggle for both of them to get Vince off a truck. Now, they're involved in stunts that seem to laugh in the face of physics. Don't get me wrong, it's fun and entertaining, but I just wish I didn't need to completely check my brain at the door in order to enjoy it.The film continues to deliver on the promise of high-octane action and thrilling set pieces. The cast's chemistry remains strong, and it's always a pleasure to see them working together. However, the sheer absurdity of some scenes, like the infamous runway sequence, stretches believability to its limits. Oh, and don't get me started on the length of that runway!Despite these over-the-top moments, there are still elements to enjoy. The humour and banter between characters add a light-hearted touch, making the more outrageous stunts easier to swallow. The story itself is engaging enough, even if it relies heavily on the ""family"" theme that's become the franchise's hallmark.While the film is undeniably entertaining, I can't help but feel that it loses some of the grounded charm that made the earlier entries appealing. The balance between action and realism tips too far in favour of spectacle, leaving little room for the more intimate, character-driven moments that I appreciate.Overall, it's a relatively fun ride that offers plenty of excitement, but it sacrifices too much in the pursuit of bigger and crazier stunts. For fans of the franchise, it's worth a watch, but it doesn't quite hit the mark as well as some of the other entries.FORMAT: Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.5

7,"More of the same after Fast Five, but still satisfying.","I watched this back to back with Furious 7, which does a disservice to Fast & Furious 6, because there is much more to talk about regarding its follow-up. That's the gut-punch Fast and Furious movie. That's the one where we have to say goodbye to Paul Walker. I'm reviewing what's a solid/fun action movie and I don't know what I can say about it substantially, because the seventh movie lingers most in my memory. But I'll do my best.The sixth Fast & Furious movie feels a lot like the fifth, perhaps too much so. Now, the fifth Fast & Furious movie was awesome, so I understand wanting to hit the same beats. It hits those beats and gets a little sillier with them, which I found fun to an extent, but there is a sense of things coming close to shark-jumping, at a point. It's a consequence of the repetition narratively speaking alongside what the filmmakers felt was a need to top Fast Five, as far as ridiculousness was concerned. I don't know if they needed to do that. Replicating the heights reached in Fast Five might've been enough, because the perfect level of stupid was achieved in that one. It's a high I'm okay with the series not reaching, from this point forward (some of those criticisms can also be applied to movie #7, but the inclusion of Kurt Russell, Jason Statham, and that powerhouse ending helped... but I'm getting ahead of myself).On its own, Fast & Furious 6 is still good. It's still entertaining. It's still my third favorite so far, after only #5 and #7. A little fatigue was setting in at this point, but #7 hit hard... and, honestly, the ending of Fast & Furious 6 was emotional enough in some ways, too. I am invested, though not entirely confident with where things will go from #7. But #6 and #7 back-to-back were fun. The former's overshadowed by the latter, but the pairing still made for a ridiculous and entertaining double feature.",Jeremy_Urquhart,"Aug 24, 2024"

7,Maybe the best in the franchise,"Five was the movie that changed the direction of the franchise and brought about a lot of changes that people loved, so when this came out most people must have thought it was just trying to be bigger and not better. I think I was the same when I saw this from the theaters 10 years ago and thinking this is not as good as five. Now, rewatching the franchise, this is the best in the franchise along with the very first one. This doesn't have the awkwardness of trying to find what it is like its predecessor, it just starts right off and goes on in top gear. There are a lot of stupid ideas in the plot itself but all of those were already established in the previous movies and everything they tried here is perfectly calculated and balanced with respect to where the franchise is. Of course, it's nothing great but they know precisely what it is and did exactly what needs to be done. Everyone knows what their roles are. The Rock has found his charming screen persona here from his rigid outing in the previous movie. Michelle Rodriguez sells the impossible job that is her role, which could have been nothing but cringe if done any differently. And they finally made the Tokyo connection which is still very weird timeline wise but at least they didn't further lengthen it.",Jithindurden,"May 9, 2023"

6,"Good, not great","This will contain some spoilers.I thought this was a good movie but not great. I definitely liked Fast Five MUCH better. I thought this movie was VERY HIGHLY predictable. I had Hobbs' new partner tagged as a traitor from the second she came on screen, that one was WAY too easy to see. Also, the second that Dom and Brian left Mia alone with the baby, it was obvious that Shaw was going after her to use as a hostage (that was easy to see as well). I thought it was also easy to see that one of the team was going to die, although I did have Han pegged as the obvious choice, I didn't see Han AND Gisele both dying. I liked the action and the stunts, even if they were sometimes ridiculous (it IS a Fast & Furious movie, the stunts are always going to be ridiculous). I had a problem with the predictability of the script. Entertaining ...... Yes. Best of the series ....... No. Best of series is definitely Fast five. One last thing......

6,Racers Avengers,"The sixth chapter of the ""Fast and Furiou"" saga continues the concept of the last two chapters, so it's configured as a generic action movie without the concentration on street racers like in the firsts movie. This means that, as all the chapters after the third, risk to make the saga just an action saga like another million in the world. Infact, in this sixth episode, in which a kind of Avengers of racers have to defeat his nemesis made by analogue criminal group (and the trait d'union is Letty on the other side because of her amnesy), races are introduced just as a spectacular element, useless for the plot, as in the fifth. The scenes with supercars are simply fights against police, and could be done also with normal cars. Moreover, the dialogues are full of infodumps and unmotivated rhetoric (especially the family one, sometimes really annoying), the characters few analyzed. In conclusion, an action movie sometimes funny sometimes bad done, anonymous as a lot of other films of this genre. You can also not call it ""Fast and furious"", like you could for the previous movie.",anthonyf94,"Sep 5, 2019"

8,The 'Fast & Furious' franchise getting better and better,"I think it's getting better and better after 'Fast Five', since the introduction of Dwayne Johnson into the franchise. After stylish 'Tokyo Drift' I loved very much this and one before it from the series. There were not many movie series that pulled the franchise from average to awesome like this one did so the credit goes to the writers and director as well as the actors.As expected finally the action babe arrived, Gina Carano. After seeing her in 'Haywire' I thought she would be next Lara Croft. I mean the next big action lady, the one after Angelina Jolie but not as I expected role though okay. There was a death of one of a main character in the movie, I kinda doubt that because of surprise re-entry of Michelle Rodriguez into the series.It was a well written script, engaging characters except one scene where Dwayne Johnson and another actor who make a British man go stripped. The movie missed having some nice action sequences from the Dwayne Johnson a little let down from that perspective. But the rest of the stunts were breathtaking. Who cares whether it is graphic are real I just enjoyed especially the final one with the aircraft which long lasts for over 20 minutes. I guess there won't be that long runway anywhere in the world :p. The movie will be more enjoyable by hardcore action movie fans so why don't you try if you have not seen yet.7.5/10",Reno-Rangan,"Nov 16, 2013"
7,Never a bad thing when a franchise can get better and better every movie.,"Wow. Fast 6. Six! And there's gonna be a seventh one too! The fast and furious franchise has never been a real favorite of mine. Since I'm in 8th grade however, I do enjoy a good turn- your-brain-off film that is oozing male testosterone from every corner, whether it's big guns, explosions, hot chicks, or body builders crashing into each other with cars. Despite all this, I've never really been a fan of the franchise until it's 5th release. Directed by Justin Lin, it was the first well shot, well paced flick of the franchise. Although it was dumb, I had a ton of fun with it. So this new one was what I needed to kick off the summer blockbuster season. And it did just that. It was still pretty stupid. The acting, overall, was pretty bad too, but there were surprisingly some pretty great performances and dialogue between some of the main characters, which was actually somewhat enjoyable and funny. Probably funnier than the actual ""comedy"" opening right alongside this one, The Hangover Part 3. The thing I enjoy most about these films, though, is the stunt work combined with pretty decent special effects. These movies are so over the top but the it's good to know that although the plot to these things aren't well thought out, the technical aspect of it all is stellar, and some of these scenes, especially with some friends, can be a blast once you see them. This movie gets so over the top that it takes away from what I liked about fast five so much: how tension built up to the unbelievable action sequence at the end. This time around, Lin puts in so much action that there's literally no room to breathe. This is why I'm still debating whether fast five or fast six was better. Fast Six definitely had a better clan, but the steady pacing in five makes me like the 2011 release a little more. It still does not change the fact that fast Six is so fun to watch. I'd say, ignore the critics and take this movie for what it is: dumb manliness portrayed on film. This movie is loads of fun. 73/100",TheSoFlyGuy1359,"May 25, 2013"

7,"Good action movie, but doesn't fully live up to its past","I am a a big fan of the Fast and Furious franchise, I own them all. Typically I rank them according to my beliefs as to how well they were done. In my mind, from best to worst: 5,4,1,3, and 2. When I look at Fast 6, I would have to put it somewhere between 4 and 1.Here's why I think this: the Fast and Furious franchise was based on the premise of fast, gorgeous cars and the shades of gray between good and bad, mostly marketed towards the gear head segment of the population. With Fast 5, we see that they are now trying to re-brand the franchise as a heist series with cars as the central method for pulling off these heists. Fast 5 did this spectacularly in my opinion, but Fast 6 was a step down. First of all, the cars were not given as much emphasis as even Fast 5 did. The fact that many of the driving sequences in this movie happen at night and the cars are mainly painted dark colors shows a distinct movement away from the car culture that made the series so popular.Secondly, this movie seems to try too hard to be funny at times. In the previous movie, there was a definite light-heartedness about the characters and their banter, but in Fast 6 the humor is not that funny and tends to be forced into inappropriate times and places.Bottom line: if you go to this movie expecting it to be a perfect continuation of the excellence of the previous movie you will be disappointed. However, if you go to see beautiful cars crash, things blow up, and epic fistfights this is the summer movie for you.",regula1,"May 24, 2013"

On the other hand, Furious 6 has a nice storyline, and the London surroundings give movie a nice Classy touch to it...

It's directed by Justin Lin, starring Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez and MANY more.The film starts off with Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) approaching Dom (Vin Diesel) about a case involving Shaw (Luke Evans) and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) who was assumed dead in the 4th segment of the series.NOTE: This review is written by a Fast & Furious fan.SO, the trailer of Fast & Furious 6 was everywhere by the time it came out and it literally caught everyone's attention, whether they were a fan or not. I, as usual, booked my ticket for the movie and hoped for the best... which isn't what I got.Now this is quite hard to explain, so I'll do my best. According to me, this film is great, no doubt. It has the fast cars, the hot chicks, the action, yet it is quite forgettable. Now, I've seen Fast & Furious 6 twice, so far, and I've tried my best to engross myself into the film, but FF6 fails to do that for me. It's like, a chase sequence will take place, and 20 minutes later, you try your best to remember what happened during that very sequence. So, to me, it has all the elements of a Fast & Furious film, yet, it fails to captivate and by the time you leave the cinema and reach home, the film just remains faintly in your head.Second problem of the film is: WHERE ARE THE CHASE SCENES? Oh my God, this is what makes a Fast & Furious film, and yet there were only 4 of them in this one. Alright, one involves a tank, and another involves an airplane, yet it does not suffice, compared to the earlier Fast Five which had plenty of chase scenes to get you engrossed in the film.But apart from the flaws, Fast & Furious 6 does have some enjoyable parts, like whenever there is an action or chase scene, it is quite fun. The comedy is quite entertaining at times and the post-credits scene is quite a cliff-hanger, involving a star who is going to make a great villain to Fast & Furious 7.In conclusion, I feel Fast & Furious 6 is half-baked. Honestly, from a Fast & Furious fan, its quite sad to say this, but FF6 doesn't hold a chance compared to Fast Five. It is fun at times, yet its extremely forgettable which makes it quite difficult to focus your attention on the screen.FAST & FURIOUS 6: 6/10",andre_rox99,"Jun 8, 2013"
6,Some thoughts...,"I'll refrain from breaking down the entire film for you given that you've either seen it or are curious about watching it. So instead I'll just hit what I considered a few of the movies strong points and not so strong points.THE GOOD: The tank scene was surprisingly awesome to watch. I didn't expect the carnage they actually showed in the film, given it was a popcorn movie. The hand to hand fight scenes were also quite well done (most notably in the train station). Obviously the movie had tons of car chases that were well handled.THE BAD: The story was very weak. So tell me again why Diesel's team is the only group of people that can take down this bad guy? It's like they predicted that there would be tons of car chases. Why would you even assume that? Besides lots of plot issues the dialogue itself was a bit hard to get through. I will say that Tyrese's character was the high point of the film for me. Thank goodness he had his little quirk. It was definitely nothing special, but if you like the franchise you'll enjoy the movie. Not one I would necessarily recommend tho.",artistgp,"Jun 7, 2013"

6,How they going to out do this one?,"Fast & Furious 6 brings the series back to its action-packed roots with impressive car chases, high-stakes heists, and intense fight sequences. The movie is undeniably fun and delivers on the thrill that fans of the franchise expect. The addition of bigger stunts and over-the-top sequences is exciting, even if it sometimes stretches plausibility.The story, however, lacks depth, feeling a bit too predictable and formulaic. Character development takes a backseat to the action, and at times, the dialogue feels a bit forced. Still, the cast's chemistry and dedication to their roles keep things entertaining, and the introduction of Letty's storyline adds an interesting twist.Overall, Fast & Furious 6 is a solid addition to the franchise that delivers plenty of high-octane excitement. It's not groundbreaking, but if you're in the mood for pure action, this movie has you covered.",Bmore-Hero,"Oct 26, 2024"

The scene with the airplane in the climax is one of the highlights of the movie. I will give this a 10/10 rating right away. Don't miss it. go and watch it right away. I am very eager for the next installment now. the film is filled with all the high-octane speed chases and close combat scenes we've come to expect from the franchise. I think this is one of the best film in the franchise. As is the trend nowadays, the closing credits provide a teaser of what's to come. In a Tokyo-set interlude we are introduced to yet another popular action star who will likely join the fast and furious crew for joyride number seven. Keep those seat belts fastened.

7,I'm going to be very straightforward,"I'm usually descriptive in my reviews, but I'm not going to do that for this movie. This movie is simple entertainment. It does not require any brain power to understand the storyline in this movie. Beautiful cars. Beautiful girls. Hunky men. Yeap. Epic.The second you start using your brain while watching the movie, you start noticing the idiocy that had taken place. For instance, how huge will Dwayne Johnson go before he just turns from the Rock into the Boulder?Also, at the very last scene, how long is the damn runway? I mean seriously?Regardless, I still enjoyed the movie. It entertained me, and as a petrol head, this movie is definitely enjoyable.Should you watch it? Yeah, why not.",bugus92,"Jul 8, 2013"
2,Gone in 60 Secs...,"This movie should have been called Gone in 60 secs because that's when i felt like leaving. I'm giving this movie a 2 star rating because it was pretty cool when the 2 semi's crashed on the highway and exploded in slow-motion. Otherwise this franchise seems to have died off long ago. Its no longer about the cars and racing, but horrible subplots about people id rather see written off then saved. Paul Walker is as bad as ever, but good thing is he was barely in this. Vin Diesel is getting to old to act and its showing. The rock also seem's juiced up like always. Paul Walker is so bad i wanted to say it twice. If you are familiar with the newer Mission Impossible movies then you've pretty much already know the story. I would rather XXX then this POS. I still don't understand how the series has gone so very wrong since the 1st film was only half bad. You know how at the end of the 1st one... where Vin Diesel flips the cool classic car?

6,Furious 6,"I really quite enjoyed F&F5 (2011), but this one has sunk back into the routine car chase and endless pyrotechnics series of scenarios and despite retaining the stalwarts in Vin Diesel (""Dom""), Paul Walker (""O'Conner"") and the more recent arrival ""Hobbs"" (Dwayne Johnson) it is all very so what? The germ of the plot is that the gang travel to London to find ""Letty"" (Michelle Rodriguez), long thought to be dead. Now it appears she is working with the nasty ""Shaw"" (Luke Evans) - but is she? Who can trust whom? It is refreshing to see that the Metropolitan police are no better at stopping the streets of their city being used as a race track - with carnage ensuing all around; even some big red buses take a hit. We have some fun with a tank, and a plane - indeed it's really only an ocean liner that is missing from this quickly paced, action effort. Sadly for me, Evans is not in the least menacing and the ending just goes on for far, far, too long. I did quite enjoy it on big screen, but I can't think I would ever bother to watch it again.",CinemaSerf,"May 15, 2023"
6,They Tried!!,"Though the movie was not that bad.. I don't think it was all that good either. It was just a movie with action...... When compared to some of the others in the series it stays with them....... I was expecting more... hoping that they would top fast 5. but they didn't.There were some good driving action scenes that's classic fast and furious but the movie felt unfinished. The teaser at the end of the movie was actually more exciting to me than most of the scenes in the movie and that's saying something.If you love the franchise don't miss the movie as it answers some questions, however if you are looking for a good action movie to kill a couple of hours.......

Seeing Jason Statham at the end was a great surprise too. I'm hoping the next movie will have a great chase scene. This is one of few franchises were you don't want any of the characters to die, I like all of them, especially Han, he was one cool cat. keep the films coming guys, Vin you are a smart business man I tell ya, put me in a film too.....how about an audition for a new character on the team, who is longing to be part of a family, I do my own stunts to.",derekholloway,"Jul 18, 2013"
6,Fast & Furious 6,"Watched this one in the local multiplex, honestly I am not an avid fanboy of this money-maker franchise, I am even not an advocate of racing vehicles, but the turning point comes when FAST FIVE (2011, 7/10) surprisingly catapults itself into a new level of sensory entertainment with its roller coaster ride and triumphantly revives the series' mass appeal to a younger generation and has grossed a series-high income means it has yet overstayed its welcome. Still helmed by Justin Lin, this 6th sequel reunites all the cast, including one of the ""original four"" Michelle Rodriguez, whose wacky insomnia and vague backstory stirs the most untenable veneer of the plot if one can excuse the physics-defying action sequences as an utmost drawing power to allure new genre lovers and retain its core audiences. So a large drawback of this one is it is solely made for one's eyes only, one should completely ignore what is the convoluted plot going on by the villain and his cohorts and plainly indulge oneself in the great stunt work to find it is worth your ticket. Unequivocally it is a tough job for any writer to create new blood for the franchise since it allows very limited leeway to inspire from the original cast, and due to the aesthetic fatigue, sooner or later, a younger cast must be mustered so as to invigorate a healthy metabolism for the faded set pieces. In this one, the newcomer is a strapping Luke Evans as the main villain, whose temperament presages a brighter future as a leading man candidate in world cinema, but unfortunately this film is not his breakthrough, at most a stepping stone permits him to be seen by more people and hence enlarges his fan base. Everyone else is pigeonholed with their respective task, Johnson bullies scumbags, Diesel emotionlessly sweet-talks with his comeback battle-axe, Walker retreats into a family man, Gibson and Ludicrous are the pair of cutups, the ass-kicking martial pro Carano is here for girl fights while Kang and Gadot cannot run away from their functional exit, which plausibly introduce another bankable name as the next villain for the next chapter, due next year and will be transferred to be under the reign of horror-genre whiz James Wan, let's pray for a miracle to sustain its longevity and if we are lucky enough, a better one next time!",lasttimeisaw,"Jul 31, 2013"

7,Justin Lin's Fast & Furious 6 (2013),"Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his friends are chillin' all over the globe, enjoying la dolce vita, after their successful heist in Fast Five (2011). However they're also longing to return home to America. Agent Hobbs (The Rock) offers them the opportunity to do just that: A clean slate in exchange for one last job. The mission includes taking down a villainous character (Luke Evans) in London, finding Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and driving fast cars, while doing crazy stunts, shooting and beating people up and stuff.Justin Lin's fourth entry in the franchise is mostly successful, thanks to an amiable cast, a cheesy, but sweet writing and some breathtaking action set pieces. The characters mostly derive from the actor's screen persona, which is not a bad thing per se, but some of the acting is stale and the screenplay doesn't really allow for much room for them to breathe and develop in a satisfying way. The action is very intense and interestingly shot in some instances, though you can sustain tension only so long, and so the last act results a bit too long. The film in general could use some leaner editing. Some scenes are basically useless, like Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) going to prison. Gina Carano's wrestling skills are impressive, but her character's twist at the end is completely pointless.Personally, I am biased to like this film, for purely nostalgic reasons: I grew up with this franchise. The film had me from the very beginning with the great opening title montage. In my estimation this is one of the few interesting franchises out there today. Borrowing too much from last year's box office hits The Avengers (exploiting the team of ""superheroes"" aspect, featuring a ""similar"" villain and also copying structural elements) and The Dark Knight franchise (the villain seems to be driving something out of a Christopher Nolan film); Furious 6 could have been better by doing its own thing like in the previous installment. The villain and his motivations are dubious and weakly executed. The result is a formulaic story. To its credit Furious 6 has a good sense of humor, but also a beautiful message about the importance of family. What I disliked was how some characters were treated, namely Roman (Tyrese Gibson) being reduced to comic relief, Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) hardly given anything to do and Elena (Elsa Pataky) completely ignored up until the end. The potential conflict between Dom's new girlfriend Giselle (Gal Gadot) and Letty also remained unexplored. The film ends on an upbeat note, but I just have a hard time buying that Brian is a father now. Stay tuned for more action to come – #7 was already announced.Verdict: Recommended. Especially if you're an action junkie, love the Fast & Furious franchise or just enjoy having Corona with your buddies and turn off your brain for 2 hours.",TheDelusionist,"May 31, 2013"
9,"Fast Five reignited this series, Fast & Furious 6 has taken it even further.","The Fast & Furious series has seen some good times and not so good times. The series has been up and down since The Fast and the Furious released in 2001, and seems to have finally decided on a permanent name for the series. When 2011's Fast Five ushered in a new vision of the franchise, brought huge success and now Fast & Furious 6 has driven that success to heights I never thought I'd see in this series.This series is really supposed to be about two things: fast cars and furious action (pun absolutely intended) and this movie provides both on a large scale. Though some of the action scenes are a bit unrealistic and clichéd, they are intense and exciting enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. High speed highway chases, big time shootouts, and some excellent hand-to-hand combat are all in full effect here and make for some very entertaining action sequences. A little more on the fisticuffs, they really were quite exciting and very well choreographed. The build up to the eventual showdown between two female characters and two juggernauts is fun and the clashes are great. The cars and other vehicles in the movie are fast paced and never leave a dull moment where something is dragged out (except for the end of the movie). So again, some of the action scenes are clichéd and predictable, but are overall a joy to watch.Now the plot and the villain. The story again revolves around Dominic Toretto and his crew who accept one last job to ensure their freedom. Things go awry, and the crew is forced into a much larger conflict than originally expected. The story takes some unexpected turns and keeps you interested for the vast majority, but at times was a little too rushed and got confusing. It wasn't the best story in an action movie I've ever seen, but it wasn't the worst either. The movie's romantic sub plot involving Dominic and Letty was good. It never made you bored and added to the emotional side a little bit. The villain, Owen Shaw, is a good antagonist. At first, he doesn't seem to pose a huge threat and is sometimes boring to get into, but eventually really shows his dark side making up for his lack of character development in the early parts of the film. The cast is great. Vin Disel (Toretto), Paul Walker (Brain O'Conner), Dwayne Johnson (Hobbs), and Luke Evans (Shaw) among many other do a great job of bringing the movie to life. Some of the supporting cast such as Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous bring a solid slate of humor to keep the film fresh while Michelle Rodriguez (Letty) and Gina Carano (Riley) provide strong female roles that aren't often seen in action films. A shout out as well to director Justin Lin, who has taken an almost dead series after Tokyo Drift and reinvented it into the fast-paced action- heavy movies we again know.I love this series. The Fast and the Furious was a highly entertaining film while the next two movies were weak. Fast & Furious in 2009 was a step up and then again, Fast Five was a new and improved direction for the series which spanned F&F6 and the already announced Fast & Furious 7 slated for a July 2014 release. This movie may at times suffer from minor cases of clichés (and the longest runway in film history), but the top heavy action sequences, highlighted by terrific fight scenes and fast paced vehicular mayhem, plentiful and entertaining humor, great cast and acceptable story more than make up for those corny parts. The Fast & Furious series (which is hopefully the name they're sticking to), is back on the map and at top form. An end credits scene connects the dots between Tokyo Drift and the since announced Fast & Furious 7, so stick around to build up even more hype for next summer's big blockbuster.8.5/10 (my score is rounded to 9 on the website's rating)",slicedbread117,"Aug 29, 2013"
7,Average,"Fast & Furious 6 keeps up the series' rapidly escalating pace. Enriched by visually captivating settings and action-packed sequences, it draws viewers in. The team battles global heists, further strengthening the bonds between characters.The action scenes, particularly the car races and fight sequences, offer an exhilarating experience. The film succeeds in immersing the audience in the action, serving as a satisfying continuation, especially for those familiar with the series.However, at certain points, the film can lean into speculation. The plot falls short in character depth by not delving sufficiently into some characters' pasts. Dialogues occasionally come across as ordinary and clichéd. Additionally, instances where the laws of physics are stretched may disrupt the sense of realism.Moreover, the film's runtime can be lengthy, and some scenes could have been more effective with tighter editing. Character motivations and certain decisions could have been better explained.In conclusion, Fast & Furious 6 emerges as an engaging film for action enthusiasts. Delivering a visual spectacle and dynamic action, it provides an enjoyable experience. However, there are weaknesses in terms of the plot and character development. While satisfying for fans, those seeking more depth might notice its shortcomings.",uhudsavascisi,"Aug 18, 2023"
5,We've fallen a long way from simply boosting cars,"CIA agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) returns and asks aid of Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew in taking down a ex-military mercenary who plans to steal a microchip capable of ruining an entire country.Following on from the previous installment Fast Five, director Justin Lin hasn't let up his intention to give this series some sort of conviction. Most of the characters return (the film even begins with a montage of all the previous films) yet for all of its efforts to make a malleable universe, we are still dealing with the most uninteresting, good-looking people. For example, Tyrese Gibson just eats stuff and laughs, while my favourite character Han still just talks about ""going to Tokyo"", it is actually getting insulting now; these films only exist as prequels to the third film so they can include him yet his only characteristic is ""I want to go to Tokyo"".Even Michelle Rodriguez returns (due to fan outcry) yet the writers couldn't think of any better excuse to bring her back than the tired ""selective amnesia"" fall back; she doesn't remember the love of her life, but she can still drive and tune a car. Don't even talk to me about the villain I have no idea what his motivations really were, and he was never threatening when up against Diesel and JohnsonThe film does do some things right compared to the deplorable Fast Five. Some things. The chase sequences here are better, specifically the chase through London and a race between Dom and Letty. But for every good race there's a over-the-top, nonsensical scenario. The crew face off against a tank. Yes, a tank. Why? Because the villain needs the microchip that is (for no good reason) stored inside the tank, inside an armoured transport. Or the final encounter that involves a carrier plane and the longest runway in the world!The film isn't terrible, but it certainly isn't good either. I have no idea why it is praised as highly as it is, but it can only be for the action sequences, fight sequences alone, which are at times impressively far-fetched. The dialogue is terrible too; all of Dwayne Johnson's lines are metaphorical nonsense: ""To catch a wolf, you need wolves. Let's go hunting!""The series is a nonsense now.",CinemaCocoa,"Apr 13, 2017"

But if you can sit back and enjoy a good action movie without giving to much credit to those scenes then you're up for a kick ass time with Fast and Furious 6. The characters are very good and keeping ""The Rock"" on the movie is very positive. I think he makes a great duo with Vin Diesel. The story isn't very elaborate, and that's the way it should be in this type of movie, but it deliver's. Fast and Furious 6 is one of the best action movies around these days, so give it a shot. 7 out of 10 !",beyonder-3,"Sep 17, 2013"
8,Just when we thought that it couldn't get bigger,"""The Rock"" is not the only one who got bigger. The whole movie goes to a massive level never before seen in the franchise. The creators of this franchise must ask themselves with each movie: How do we make this bigger? Because is getting ridiculous how massive are the racing scenes on Furious 6 (yes, that's the title showed in the intro). Well, there are not exactly racing scenes on this one (safe for one), it their place the writer puts a lot of car chasing scenes. There are so much persecution scenes on this movie that every character suffers at least one big accident in which, of course, none of them gets hurt. Everyone survives accidents that could finish with all the nine lives of a cat, without a single scratch. Between that and sort scene on a bridge involving certain characters flying on the air, the phrase ""Oh common!"" is useless in this one. That said, it is clear that we are not talking about an Academy Award Winner movie. We are talking about the Die Hard of racing cars. All the car sequences are great, full with action and emotion. Every single fan is going to be pleased at the end of the film. The story is very simple. There is a bad guy. Letty is working with him. The crew must bring Letty back home. The truth is that it works. The focus point of the film is to discover how she survives and why she didn't came back home. At least I can say that they came up with a good explanation of how that happens. But it must be clear that everything here has been made to please the fans. In other words, there are some decisions made in this film that if you think about it you will probably be disappointed. So is better if you just enjoy the ride and don't think about it too much. The theme is the family. That's actually how (finally) the cast is feeling. On Fast Five there are characters knowing each other, but in this one everybody knows everybody. So they're one big family in the film and it is perceive as if they have become one big family outside the set. Even Hobbs feels like part of the family, even being a cop. The new guy is the villain, Sebastian Shaw (Luke Evans). He did a fine job and maybe that's because he is a good actor or because at last we have a bad guy who isn't a drug dealer. Shaw is more like a terrorist, so he is more memorable than the others. Universal Pictures has confirmed the seventh film for July 2014 release date. That means that, even when we got a close ending, if you stay 10 more seconds you will witness an extra scene. In that scene we close one character gap (sadly but at last), and we're introduced the new bad guy. And he makes an impression on both, ladies and men. With that scene the producers make a statement: Fast & Furious 7 will be bigger than this.",damh_frikinlater,"May 23, 2013"
7,Tank Abbot,"If ""Fast 5"" was the reboot, by this film were well into the 'laws of physics don't apply' section of the franchise now and it's all the better for it.Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) recruits a retired Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) to help him bring down a skilled terrorist Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). Hobbs believes that the Familia might be motivated to help him, as Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is not dead, as previously thought, but working as part of Shaw's gang. Shaw is stealing technology to build a device capable of disabling electrical functions for a large radius. They track him to London, when after a failed capture attempt Dom and Letty come face to face.OK. So maybe it's not the first time that the series has defied the laws of physics. That safe would almost certainly have dragged the cars all over the place in the last film, but Dom's superman moment in this one feels like 'the' moment the series went, ""OK, anything is on the table now"". This is not criticism, by the way, movies can and should often be big dumb escapist moments and no series has captured that ethos more than this one.Where the series is less successful, and this one is no exception, is in the dialogue department. It pushes banter in the direction of Ludacris and Tyrese again this time, but it's not good stuff. I think that The Rock is perhaps the only person in this franchise capable of delivering comedy, but it doesn't really suit the Hobbs character. No fewer than four characters in this film would come back from the dead at some point in the franchise, which has to be some sort of record. There were a couple of recognisable faces in Shaw's team, including Clara Paget, from ""Black Sails"" and David Ajala from ""Supergirl"" and ""Star Trek: Discovery"".As I say, this is the first one that feels like it fits in the full madness of the franchise, it's a fun film that I enjoyed rewatching.",southdavid,"Jul 9, 2023"

6,Worth the ticket,"Fast and Furious 6 is quite on par with the rest of the movies in the series. Not the best, but definitely not the worst. The first hour and a half were quite good, and I didn't understand what the other reviewers were complaining about. It felt just like the other movies, and some parts were even better. But the last two action sequences were exaggerated.The good about Fast and Furious 6: All the members of the team were busy and had their parts. This is the first time that they were actually matched with a tough rivals. Luke Evans played his character well, and he had a crew that was physically tough, sophisticated and well equipped. The return of Letty is good thing as well. Michelle Rodriguez was perfect.The bad: The exaggerated last action sequences. It's not that Fast 5 had a credible last scene. It didn't have, but I didn't think about it when I was watching it. It was just fun. Here I found myself thinking 'this is too much'. Another think is Hobbs. I liked him in the fifth movie. Here I find him slightly annoying. And some fights in the end felt redundant.

7,"A Brainless, Souped-Up Guilty Pleasure","The series that just can't quit - ""Fast & The Furious 6"" is about as preposterous as they come (and I've seen Pacific Rim!), but all is forgiven when there's so much idiotic car chase action and nice scenery.Like the souped-up muscle cars in the movie, it's noisy and it all goes by very fast, and a few hours later, I couldn't quite connect what the whole James Bond plot was about, or really care. It does have at least 4 good action set pieces, and by good I mean physics-defying, Wile E. Coyote-type - but the film is somehow cheerfully silly/good none-the-less.

6,"Fast & Furious 6 copies what made its predecessor so rejuvenating, just set in London.","'Fast Five' was a franchise high, transforming a forgettable street-racing montage into an action extravaganza that disregards all laws of physics. This sequel doesn't add too much to Hollywood's popular soap-opera, but it didn't need to. ""Family"" and absurd set pieces is what you want, and Lin certainly delivers them. Just a shame the fluffiness in between marks for some dangerous pacing issues. More swerve-inducing than a learner driver thinking they could outrace Dominic Toretto! The infamous team of criminals are recruited by the beefcake that is Luke Hobbs, in an attempt to retrieve a world-threatening component back from another team of criminals. Oh, and Letty is alive working for the opposing team. So it just got personal!This sixth instalment waves the usual traits found in this franchise right in your face. Babes in skimpy attire almost pleasuring themselves on top of muscle cars before a street race? Check. Vin Diesel grumbling his way through dialogue? Definitely. ""Family"" being the most commonly used word in the third screenplay? Probably. And enough delirious action set pieces that forces you to question every physic known to man? Absolutely. Pushing aside CGI Dom launching himself through the air to catch Letty across a bridge and landing safely on the bonnet of a car, it's just an enjoyable action film that knows exactly what it is. Audiences came for outrageous and memorable set pieces, Lin delivered them. Viewers wanted interactions between their favourite character, Lin granted them to us.This is the pivotal instalment that solidified the direction of the franchise, so it made perfect sense not to change up the overall tone. That being said, some captivating substance in between the blistering action would've been appreciated. It's just heavy-handed storytelling, spelling out the plot with magnetic letters one may find on their fridge door, and some forced humorous moments for Gibson's character. Not nearly as tantalising as a tank decimating oncoming traffic or cinema's longest runway in existence (nearly fifteen minutes of full throttle acceleration). Consequently, this does produce several lulling moments, perhaps forcing you to look at your watch. The cast are all enjoying themselves and rarely push their talent, although Evans was probably the first memorable antagonist in the entire series, but they didn't need to in all honesty.The high-octane gear changing speaks for itself. There's enough diesel in this sequel to produce a rip-roaring fun action blockbuster, if you can get passed the inconsistent pacing in its elongated runtime. Oh, and Rita Ora...",TheMovieDiorama,"Jul 20, 2019"
6,Very wild,"F and F 6 is just a masala film for fun. No morals to be learnt. Film follows its prequels wherein Hobbs seeks the help of exiled Toretto to stop a megalomaniac criminal form executing his plans to destroy the world. Toretto agrees for the sake of his own interests, but soon the team are upto more than they expect.Like said before, a 'masala' film - action, comedy, violence, sleaze and women, thrilling car rides....it definitely keeps you hooked.

6,The Soap Opera Continues,"I don't even say it like it is a bad thing, but this series has definitely become a soap opera. I said it in my last review when the plot seemed to be extended too far, but now we have complete memory loss factoring it which absolutely sounds like a plot from the soap operas my gram would watch when I was young. This was a pretty easy movie to rate. If you are looking for action, it delivers. If you are looking for plot or humor, it doesn't. There are enough scenes to like for me to rate it about the same as others in the franchise, but that is considering the audience and not its absolute cinematic quality. You get what you expect with these movies, but their target audience seems pretty small once we get to the 6th one in the franchise.",jaredlemin,"Feb 1, 2025"

6,"The daftest entry yet, but shows no signs of fatigue","There was once a time when this franchise retained a shred of realism. At the climax of the first film, The Fast and the Furious (2001), there is a moment in which a character must make a life-or- death leap from a moving truck into a moving car, both travelling at super-high speed along a straight road. Following the series' and its characters transition from lovable rogue criminals who dabbled in robberies and drag racing, into a super-group of international ass-kicking Robin Hood types, such distractions as the laws of physics are no longer an issue. Yes, this is the daftest entry yet, but the series shows no signs of fatigue, and, judging by the ever- increasing box office receipts, it won't be throwing in the towel any time soon.After reaping the rewards of their multi-million dollar heist in the previous film, Fast Five (2011), the Fast & Furious gang are scattered and enjoying living the high life. Dom (Vin Diesel) is shacked up with Elena (Elsa Pataky), and Brian (Paul Walker) has seen the birth of his son Jack with Mia (Jordana Brewster). Han (Sung Kang) is in Hong Kong with Gisele (Gal Gadot), and Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Taj (Ludacris) are indulging in a life of private plans, expensive suits, and an entourage of babes. However, their retirement is interrupted by the arrival of D.S.S. agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), who brings Dom the shocking news that we were teased with in the post-credits scene of the fifth movie.Dom's former girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), believed to have been murdered in the fourth movie, Fast & Furious (2009), is in fact alive and kicking, and working with international terrorist Shaw (Luke Evans), a Brit whose criminal philosophies come into direct contrast with that of Dom's. To Shaw, his team are little more than moveable pieces to be manipulated and sacrificed for his own gain, while Dom believes in the sanctity of 'family'. After a thrilling set-piece involving Shaw escaping in a custom-made racing car through the streets of London (clearly the film-makers have never seen the traffic in the capital), Dom comes across Letty for the first time, who in return shoots Dom without blinking. It appears amnesia is to blame.You have to hand it to long-serving franchise helmer Justin Lin, who is given the task of increasing the ante with every film, and always having to involve cars. And what better road vehicle to employ to increase the carnage than a tank? We get that and a plane, in what feels like the longest runway take-off ever seen on screen. As long as the plane is still on the ground, it doesn't stand a chance against Dom and co. With their evolution from petty criminals into fully-fledged heroes comes an inexplicable ability for hand-to-hand fighting. We get Letty take on series newcomer Riley (Gina Carano from 2011's Haywire) with roundhouse kicks and wrestling moves, and a slow-motion leaping headbutt from Diesel in what proves the film's giddiest, must ludicrous moment. And with the series finally catching up to the events seen in Tokyo Drift (2006), we are offered a glimpse at the next film's antagonist, which, I'm rather ashamed to say, is an exciting moment indeed.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",tomgillespie2002,"Feb 14, 2015"

8,Fast & Furious 6 Review,"Fast & Furious 6(2013) Starring: Paul Walker, Vin Disel, Dwayne Johnson, Jordana Brewster, Luke Evans, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Gal Gadot, Sung Kang, Ludicrous, Kim Kold, Thure Lindhardt, Elsa Pataky, Johannes Taslim, Shea Whigham, John Ortiz, Gina Carano, Clara Paget, and Jason Statham Directed By: Justin Lin Review All ROADS LEAD TO THIS. Dang this series is starting to be the action franchise to go to, it's the equivalent to an 80's action movie. But only it's a series with sequel after sequel after sequel after sequel and guess what they've been getting better. Ever since I saw the first four Fast movies I thought they were terrible but they had a fanbase so they kept making them of course and then came five which is what this series should be and it's also one of my favorite films of all time because it is one of the best action movies in years that isn't based on a superhero. Fast & Furious six delivers a badass action flick as well. The film has Hobbs assembling Dominic and Brian reassemble their crew to take down a team of mercenaries: Dominic unexpectedly gets convoluted also facing his presumed deceased girlfriend, Letty. The opening sequence and credits alone to me would have been worth the price of admission. It's one of the best opening sequences I've seen in this series in particular since Fast & Furious which no mind you is a bad one. Any fan of this loved this one which is great cause with word of mouth they got the naysayers attention and they see well you know what the last one was awesome and this one is just as good too, so know everyone is on board wit this series. This series was always had the purpose about being fun action movies, but in this day and age if your going to be an action film in a growing franchise your going need to step up your game. That's exactly what this series doing now. It has an interesting plot with the return of the one characters, Letty played by Michelle Rodriguez who was presumed dead in Fast & Furious. She has lost he memory and is working with the films villain played Luke Evans. The Performances are good for the most but at moments can be a little stiff, and Gal Gadot what little dialogue she does have in the film she still can't act. I liked most the main cast they were good actually they were great but yet again at times stiff. The acting is still good for the most part. The direction from Justin Lin hast Vastly improved since Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift and I'm guessing that what's happening in the series was either his plan or the writers plan or I don't know someone who works with him on these movies. Fast & Furious six contains all the greatness of the previous chapter in this series with an interesting story, good acting that at is stiff at times and has one bad performance from one actress but good direction and the most intense action sequences you'll see with crazy stunts, I'm giving Fast & Furious six a four out five.",Spideyfan-963-246215,"Sep 9, 2016"
6,Dom is at it again,"Having resurrected the series after the critically panned sequel – 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS - returning director Justin Lin rigs this sixth installment with an action packed cocktail of nitrous oxide and adrenalin; a perfectly blended chemical compound that will have you laughing out loud even as you clench your toes through the film's high-octane action sequences.Picking up where FAST 5 ended, US Diplomatic Security Service Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) grants fugitives Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and former FBI Agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) a full pardon if they help him take down criminal mastermind Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). Toretto is of course uninterested, until Hobbs reveals that Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is alive but working for Shaw. A far as the synopsis goes, that's all you need to know, because that's all there is to it. To be fair, the FAST & FURIOUS saga has always been about high speed races and chases and less about character development or a mindboggling story. And Like the preceding films, the background story in this sixth installment is literally in the back seat, with emphasis on the ride rather than the destination. Neither is FURIOUS 6 the type of film inclined towards rocket scientists or viewers searching for logic. George Smiley burrowing after a Soviet spy within MI6? No. Regular doses of humour, peppered with death-defying stunts? Yes, and there is a truck load of it and it comes at you just as the title promises. This, essentially, is what makes FURIOUS 6 subjectively indulgent, with or without the popcorn. However, there is food for thought and fans of the series could be split debating whether or not this film is the best in the series. Although Lin injects a fresh canister of cinematic nitro, this latest episode lacks a worthy antagonist even though this film has the largest character ensemble in the series. On that note, characters don't die and dead ones are brought back. While there is a timeline-unknotting-explanation for that, the fact remains that Shaw is heavily outnumbered, and it shows. After five globetrotting adventures, Dom's 'family' has increased in size with many characters reappearing from previous films. In addition, Hobbs is no longer an advisory and along with his team of Special Forces sharp-shooters, becomes Dom's souped-up armory on wheels. There are also issues with continuity amid rip-off moments from iconic action films (think Lethal WEAPON 3). Through all the vehicular carnage, characters can take a beating, and still appear unfazed and unharmed. This carries on till the final skirmish onboard a cargo plane on a take-off run, on what has to be the world's longest runway! Real pilots in the audience would probably wet themselves laughing. But despite its flaws, some even absurd, FAST & FURIOUS 6 is a high energy action movie and competently made. Fans are treated to having Rodriguez back and there is a whole subplot about her 'new' character. Tyrese Gibson is also back but this time, more than ever, serves one real purpose and that is to shoot out some well-timed one-liners. As a summer opener, it not only revs up the fun-o-meter but also hurtles past the competition as a lucrative action film franchise. Bruce Willis - kindly heed that last line. While it is unusual for sequels to get better with each release, the FAST & FURIOUS franchise seems to mature with age and there is a very strong suggestion of a seventh installment. An end credits scene confirms this with the introduction of a new character. Pay attention to the film's baldness joke and you might just figure out who joins the cast in the next movie. If you do, you might also win premier passes for FAST & FURIOUS 7!",LloydBayer,"Sep 8, 2013"
9,Incredible 6th installment,"Despite a poorly handled character death, Fast and Furious 6 is an incredible sequel that continues to build on the franchise high of the previous installment. Justin Lin's direction is once again great. The returning cast are all great and their chemistry is fantastic. The action is incredible and some of the best in the franchise. It even fixes the problem with the previous installment with Luke Evans, who is an extremely good villain.",masonsaul,"Jul 28, 2019"
6,Not worth all the hype,"Following the success of Fast Five, the sixth installment of one of the longest running and most profitable movie franchises ever had some pretty big shoes to fill in, however, this was not accomplished this time. To keep the series going and attract the audience the franchise was turned into an action series with some car chases here and there to please everyone, at the expense of almost everything else.Despite this change the fifth movie was somewhat original and brought something new, while remaining faithful to the basics that made this franchise known all around the world. Personally I think the ""it's an action movie, what would you expect?"" type of arguments are just lame excuses to cover up the flaws, and Furious 6 has a lot. From a poorly written script with a character that is brought from the dead and magically learns how to fight UFC style, despite serious injuries and an amnesia (no, couldn't have learned it with the other guy, they weren't that close...) to the action scenes themselves there's nothing new to see here, except more of the same mindless action sequences and even more unrealistic stunts (yap, too much, even for this series). For a vast majority this will be enough, for everyone else it won't. The writers could have made a better job IMO by keeping Dom in his new relationship (which was more than just a mere ""rebound"" apparently...) and not using constantly the ""got to get rid of a certain character to complete the trilogy"" philosophy. Fast Five still remains the best. so far.",nunophoenix-683-948557,"Dec 8, 2014"
1,You will love this movie... if you're 12 years old,"I got suckered/tricked into watching this movie with friends, otherwise I would never have watched it. I quit watching the F&F series after the second movie; so I haven't seen parts 3,4 and 5.The whole concept and the plot of these movies are of course completely ridiculous. But obviously many people don't care about that. At the time of writing this movie has a rating of 7,7 at IMDb. This high rating can easily be explained. Since it's part 6 of the series, most people know what to expect. People who don't like the previous parts, will not bother to watch part 6. So I'm assuming mostly die hard F&F fans have watched it in the cinema and they have given the movie a high rating. You can't rate a movie if you haven't watched it...I won't go into details of the movie, but trust me, if you're an adult and not easily impressed by all things shiny, this movie is not for you. I watched this in an IMAX theater and still not a single action scene could impress me. Don't get me started on the plot, humor, dialogue etc.Since many people use IMDb ratings to find out whether a movie is any good, I have voted 1 out of 10; to offset the high ratings that a lot of F&F fans have given. Otherwise I might have given it a 2.",diniz-702-167623,"Jun 3, 2013"

8,Review of the movie Fast and Furious 6,"Fast and Furious Keeps Getting Better The action-packed saga Fast and Furious adds another sequel to the collection that exceeds expectations. ""Fast and Furious 6""; starring Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, is set in a new country with new boundaries to overcome. Director Justin Lin is at it again producing another great movie that is entertaining. ""Fast and Furious 6"" hits all emotions and makes you feel like you're apart of the adventures taking place. The Fast and Furious franchise has improved their movies from the first one in 2001.Retired street racers Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) have started calm lives with their family in foreign countries after pulling off a major robbery in ""Fast 5"". Throughout every Fast and Furious movie, it is shown that Dom's main concern is his family because he believes family will never let you down. Since family is very important to Dom and his group they decide to help Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) in exchange for amnesty to return home and to possibly save one of their own.While watching this movie you will experience all kinds of emotions. Like all the other Fast and Furious movies, this new one of course has a couple high intensity car sequences that will have you on the edge of your seat. The special effects used to make these shots do a very good job in making each scene feel believable and real. From flying through the air to car crashes, each scene looks authentic and convincing. There are also many scenes that will cause you to tear up a bit and lay heavy on your heart. In addition to a having a notable plot, the main characters Vin Diesel and Paul Walker show the ease of committing to their role. Since they have played these characters for 6 movies in 12 years, Diesel and Walker have great chemistry on screen and are able to successfully become their characters. These two main characters are also best friends off screen and use that relationship to make their characters seem very close. Vin Diesel does an especially great job as portraying the tough street racer with a hard exterior yet is able to have a soft spot when it comes to his family because of his mannerisms and tone of voice. With all the action shots during this film, the cinematography does a very good job in each scene. By having close up and long shots at the right time, it is easy to see the emotions and body language of each character during the shot. This is especially shown in the major action scenes involving a tank on a highway and a plane crashing. The angles used help display the full effect of how intense and extreme each sequence is ""Fast and Furious 6"" makes each viewer want to be apart of the film. Being the second most successful Fast and Furious movie, ""Fast and Furious 6"" is a great one to see. It is impressive for the Fast and Furious franchise to still be producing movies in the saga. By improving each new movie, the franchise has become very successful and have created a fan base that is excited for each new movie created.",hotamolly,"Oct 4, 2015"
6,The one with the longest runway ever,"From an action perspective, ""Fast & Furious 6"" is everything you could ask for in a movie. There are tanks, airplanes and an insane bridge jump, among many fast cars. If you can throw logic aside, the action is exciting and fun.I liked seeing the whole gang together and clicking. While I'm not a huge fan of the ""not dead but with amnesia"" plot point, it works decently well in this movie.The action editing is strong, but the rest of the editing is a bit clunky. The acting gets better with every installment, though Ludacris' performance is particularly bad.Best Character: Brian

9,Upping the Ante,"I've said it many times before, but one of the main reasons why the F&F movies failed to reach mass appeal before Fast Five was because of their villains. They were always forced to take on low end drug dealers and people who have little to do with their line of work; driving cars really fast and stealing things. With Fast & Furious 6, the team gets to take on Owen Shaw & his own crew, who are equally as good at doing crazy stuff on wheels.Dom regathers his team, including Brian, Han, Gisele, Roman, and Tej, after Hobbs comes to him with an offer he can't refuse. The chance to save Letty from Shaw and take him down, in exchange for full pardons all the way around. After quite a few films on the run and unable to return to his home in Los Angeles, there's no way he could turn down this opportunity, even if it meant going up against his former girlfriend thought dead, Letty. Fast & Furious 6 has even more muscle, explosions, faster cars, and just downright insanity. But it isn't as clean cut or polished as Fast Five. Granted, a movie like this doesn't necessarily need to have a concise story or developed characters, but they've done a much better job at doing those things within the last few films. The 6th film feels a little slower and maybe even a little too long, with the end product still putting a huge smile on my face. But when comparing the two, a second watch definitely exposes some of this film's minor flaws.The one thing this film, and pretty much all of the films since 4, is that each keeps topping itself. Just when you think they couldn't top stealing a vault and dragging across the streets of Brazil, they take down planes with cars. The tone deafness of the series is gone and the new breed of F&F is here to stay. The crazy thing is, you buy into all of it. I bought into the family from the beginning and I one-hundred-percent buy into the series embracing it's goofiness. The film also manages to implement more humor into the 6th film which is something the franchise has been missing. Or at least, humor that actually makes people laugh. I won't count those horrible attempts at humor in the 2nd film.What makes this film stick out his that it's the first time the crew gets to go up against an entirely new crew with the same set of skills. Luke Evans is great as Owen Shaw, The Rock has never been better, and who doesn't love watching Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson crack one- liners at each other. Better yet, every word out of Vin's mouth is a one-liner. Overall, the ante is once against raised and the series punches its way through another smash hit. Fast & Furious 6 is an insane thrill ride from the beginning to end.+Owen Shaw+Team vs Team+Rock & Vin working together+Always pushing the genre and series to a new level-A bit slower & a tad too long9.1/10",ThomasDrufke,"Apr 13, 2017"
7,Exaggerated Villains....,"First of all, this movie is quite awesome, but not as good as Fast 5 which IMO is the best of all FF franchise. The plot is more simple with a predictable twist in the end. The story also serves for wrapping up all the FF series for a grand finale in FF7 so it loads with lots character and effort to tie those loose ends (but not convincing enough) in previous sequel and rearrange the series in order so we can see now that FF3 is actually the FF6. So no wonder, there are some unnecessary scenes (ie Connor meets Braga in jail) which make less portion of actions scenes.The FF team become more solid in this sequel, everyone has a good portion to show their character and role in the movie. I think Han & Gisele relationship here somehow is more subtle & memorable than ""it'a all about family"" excuses that Dom and others bragging about throughout the film.However, the villain team is under my expectation. They are not as Hobbs, Braga or others picture them to be. They don't look scary, mean or dangerous to me, they just look tense and a bit nervous, except Shaw and that big Russian guy. While Shaw indeed is a cool and thinker mastermind, it's hard to believe that he is as powerful as Braga said. He doesn't have that powerful and dominant charm/aura.So 7 out of 10 from me.",adhipar,"May 27, 2013"

7,Middle-of-the-Road FF Entry,"The series starts to get kinda dumb again here, but it's not too dumb to enjoy yet.

Even their characters clearly hate each other. Keep getting a Ron Burgundy / Wes Mantooth vibe (""I cold, dead HATE you...but dammit, do I respect you!"").",matthewssilverhammer,"May 15, 2020"
2,Unbelievable how this movie has such a high rating.,"This has to be the worst movie I have ever watched. I should mention that I have not watched any of the previous movies in the series. I sure hope they were better.the target audience for this must be 8-12 year olds.Bad Acting, Cheesy lines and the complete absence of logic/physics literally left me face-palming at one point in the movie.I tried to go along with it, I really did.

6,Boom Boom bam bam!,"First of all I cannot believe this is the 6th of this franchise!! Wow.Well, the movie was exactly what I was expecting! Fast cars, and boom boom action! Regardless of what the real franchise was meant to be this movie was OK. But only because there was some good action sequences most of which looked real to me not like the animated looking action we see these days! But guys, this is suppose to be a car racing type movie! Which suddenly dissipated since the 3rd movie! Well you can find so many flaws in this movie that i don't even need to mention! But that runway thing was totally i mean tooootally stupid.You want good action? Go see this movie. You want to make sense of it? No buddy this movie isn't for you.",farhad-cfc,"Jul 7, 2013"
7,"""Fast & Furious 6"" is a crowd-pleaser which will leave the crowd anxious for more.","""Fast and Furious 6"" is everything fans of the franchise have come to expect and should probably please most fans of action movies, regardless of whether they've ever driven fast or been furious before. I admit that I came late to this party. The older I get, the less interested I am in movies that seem to exist just to blow things up (which is why I can't stand the ""Transformers"" films), but the previous ""Fast and Furious"" movie looked so good, I thought I'd give it a shot. I'm glad I did. It was a lot of fun - and so is the most recent sequel.In this latest entry in the series, the gang is talked into trying to bring down another gang out to steal a highly sensitive computer chip. They're also trying to rescue a character who supposedly died earlier in the series. As the stakes between the dueling gangs of drivers rise, so does the adrenalin. The action and the stunts are bigger and more spectacular than in the previous film, which is no small accomplishment. Of course, in this series, you have to keep pushing the ""I believe"" button, but if your button is still functional by the end of the film, you will have had a great time. You'll also be looking forward to the next installment. The last scene in this film feels like the first scene from the next one was slipped into the credits by accident - and the apparent villain in that scene is one most action movie fans will recognize and be anxious to see join this increasingly popular franchise. I give ""Fast and Furious 6"" a ""B+"" with the possibility of an even higher grade for the next one, based on the last scene of this one.",CleveMan66,"Feb 24, 2015"
7,"""Furious 6"" Review","Let's get it out of the way, ""Furious 6"" is an insanely stupid movie. The acting is horrendous, the writing is worse, and the plot is thinner than a playing card. However, despite all of these flaws, this film is immensely entertaining. It's fast, full of energy, and one liners that will have you rolling on the floor. It's a film that knows exactly what it is and what it wants to achieve. It isn't afraid to mix over the top action with sappy melodrama. The film has its own unique style and is filled with what young people today refer to as ""swag."" Justin Lin has done wonders with this franchise. The racing/car chase sequences are well shot and edited. The audience really feels apart of the experience. Along with the fast and adrenaline infused car sequences, this film has the best hand to hand combat so far this year. The fights are well choreographed, shot, and edited to a point were I almost feel every punch and kick being thrown. There are some ridiculous set pieces in this film, but they are exciting and entertaining as heck. I was literally at the edge of my seat even when my brain was telling me that what is happening is totally idiotic.I feel that I don't really have to talk about the actors or characters at this point. Mainly due to the fact that they've been around for so long and also because they're not the main reason for why we go see these films. I know they have a special place in our hearts now, but they aren't all too interesting or filled with enough depth to go into detail. However, I do love how we feel apart of their family.Overall, ""Furious 6"" is a very entertaining and fun film. The plot, writing, and characters may be dumb, but hey, this series is like family and no matter how stupid or dumb it can be, we love it no matter what. Especially when we have physics defying stunts, a great soundtrack, and The Rock. I give it 3.5/5, a popcorn flick that knows exactly what the audience wants.",TheConnoisseurReviews,"May 29, 2013"
8,Just a great action movie,"Great cars, fine actors, amazing fights and OMG the actions scenes from the car chases were good enough to make me happy and put a big ass smile on my face. Even if you don't like cars, this is a great example of a good action movie, fun, simple but with nice twists and...if you really don't like cars, with this franchise you will start liking them, and a lot! Can't wait for the next one. Finally this movies, the fast and furious franchise did something other franchises should do, mix the recipe, change the story, present new and exciting characters and make a new great feeling for the movies to come. Hope other franchise do the same, if necessary!",girarrazaval,"Apr 16, 2015"

8,MY REVIEW: The Sixth Gear of Fun and Action!!,"Furious 6. Made on a story that can be detailed in single line ""Hobbs has Dom and Brian reassemble their crew in order to take down a mastermind who commands an organization of mercenary drivers across 12 countries."" Furious 6 is a mad enjoyable watch or some sort of guilty pleasure. Lack of a thrilling storyline is covered by grand canvas, ruthless action, races and chases, peppy background score, man on man fights, woman on woman fights, cars against tanks and even planes. Some action scenes go over the top and you need to avoid applying logic every now and then to enjoy the sequences. All actors play their part OK and their conversations are mostly laced with delicious one liners. So, Furious 6 delivers what it promises, fasten your seat belts and enjoy the ride.",saytosandeep,"Feb 7, 2014"
6,Incredible action sequences.,"Justin Lin is yet again back as director, for the fourth film in a row. 'Fast & Furious 6' follows directly on F5. Dom's team is now living the good life, having received $100 million each after a successful, daring heist in 'Fast and the Furious 5'.The series is starting to play like a soap opera. Letty - thought to be dead in F4 - is back - with amnesia. Braga from F4 makes a small appearance. Hobbs is back as well, and this time he needs Dom's team to help him with a case. The antagonist this time around is Shaw (Luke Evans), whose team Letty joined when she was found alive.The series is no longer about cars. The films have become highly intelligent spy films, but also a lot more complicated. (I so enjoyed the simple premise of the original film). F6 features excellent action choreography and photography, and the action sequences are incredibly fast. The tank scene is incredible and is best seen to be believed.Some of the scenes are unbelievable, though, and for effect only. The film is starting to look like a superhero movie with the characters doing stuff that's not humanly possible. Some practical effects made way for CGI, which is clearly evident throughout the film. They're starting to push action to the boundaries of reality, but it was still rather exciting.The film has in incredible finale as they're trying to stop a plane from taking off. Nail biting suspense and action all the way during this stunning climax. (F6 links with 'Fast and the Furious 3: Tokyo Drift', which was supposed to be a standalone film).'Fast and the Furious 6' is another great addition to the series, indicating the series still hasn't overstayed its welcome.",paulclaassen,"Aug 5, 2020"
1,terrible,"I cannot believe that someone can give this movie 5 or more stars and says it is great. Ha, ha. I give it 2 stars, but I rate it 1 to counter balance the other overrated reviews. Basically terrible script and terrible story. Acting is a joke. Let's see one example. Terrorists want to grab a computer chip from the military base but soldiers instead of protecting it in the base send it out somewhere. Very stupid idea generally since military base is a fortress. But OK, let's pretend that this is some kind of protocol. So what does this convoy have? One truck and two jeeps. Really??? Come one, the whole movie is like that. One big joke. Scenery looks good however, but that is not enough to give it more that 3 stars.",vardown,"Jul 9, 2013"
7,Worth a watch for Dom and Brian,"The movie is a fast paced action packed movie, as expected!Fast 5 ended with Letty being shown as alive, so obviously the curiosity was high regarding the suspense. The second thing to look forward to was the partnership between Dom and Hobbs.The suspense regarding Letty was nicely built up but probably ended up being weak in the end. Dom and Hobbs, together had a nice going with muscles and bashing all around. They find an able enemy in Klaus and Shaw.For me, the revelation of this movie was the chief villain Shaw, played by Luke Evans. He brings a certain arrogance, suave and menace, as expected from any villain who would be fighting against the likes of Dom. He does a good job. The movie has nice suspense in between and the end. It does go a little slow in between but that is a relief as it will gave u time to catch your breath amongst all the fast paced action with cars speeding and flying all around. The movie does not fail with the core of the movie, car racing! New cars, new stunts and new tactics. Some of the scenes, although, were blown out of proportion! Overall Justin Lin and Chris Morgan do good justice to the series.And yes! The movie does answer the question whether there'll be another one in the series. Go watch it for the answer, mine got ruined because of the social websites, go and watch it before someone spoils it for u (if it still hasn't happened already!)",ankitbahri,"May 31, 2013"
7,Still not believable in action but ups its story one more than Fast Five (2011),"By this point in any movie franchise, if a series of films all related and connected to each other reach beyond two sequels, there must be a loyal following behind it. That also means something is being done right to the franchise (for some). Now although Universal's The Fast and the Furious (2001) feature film debut and subsequent sequels all do not have glowingly positive and overwhelming reviews, the production managed to find its demographic. When The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) came out with writer Chris Morgan and director Justin Lin handling the project, who would've suspected that they would have collaborated for three more films in the franchise. Amazingly even with writer Chris Morgan back tracking by introducing a later sequel earlier, the franchise persuaded its loyal fans to stick to it and keep following the later entries.After breaking free of the law and living in a secluded life from trouble, newly appointed father Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), wife Mia (Jordana Brewster) and Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) finally could enjoy the time they always wanted together. Or so they thought; Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) returns to Toretto showing him recent pictures of what Dominic thought was his dead girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguiez) who turns out is working for a group deadly mercenaries headed by a man named Shaw (Luke Evans). Upon this newly discovered information, Hobbs and Toretto agree that if Hobbs gets Shaw, Toretto will get Letty. So in order to capture Shaw, Toretto regroups once more with the crew he gathered from Fast Five (2011) in hopes reclaiming Letty and helping Hobbs out. For what started all the way back in The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006), Chris Morgan's screenplay finally,....finally realigns itself to the timeline it initially broke from. Out of all things, this was one of the most crucial things that needed to be fixed and by golly it's wonderful to see everything add up again.But aside from this, Morgan shows that he had an appreciation and respect for the films he did not write for earlier because of how he treats the characters. Dominic Toretto's underlining factor to why he's so good is because of the family he has. In the early entries it was about racing, hot girls, slick cars and understanding one's place among all that. Later on, it turned into revenge and then fleeing the law. Now, it's just about family. It doesn't get anymore selfless than that and it feels more genuine than ever among all the previously established characters (including the recently new ones). Now everyone works together for a common cause. There's no second-guessing this anymore and that's just the writing alone. The fact that this is written into the script and the actors can pull it off without having to act as so much as being themselves is also a plus. The installments before this did have emotion and arguments related to family matters, but this film feels authentic in every sense of the word when it comes to feelings.Every actor plays off each other like it was another day in the life of the job they do daily. There's no tension at any point between any of Toretto's crew because they know what makes each other tick and that makes it all the more preferable to see when it comes to interactions. Luke Evans also feels like the most formidable villain Toretto and O'Conner have ever come up against. Not only is he smart, agile and callous but also tends to be one step ahead of Toretto and Co., even Hobbs. For once, Toretto can't keep up and to see him challenged is definitely a new thing. The action that ignites between Toretto and Shaw's gang is much more interesting to watch this time too. Although it is still way over the top (if not more than before) and the physics behind such reactions remain unlikely, the sequences feel much more creative this time. This is probably due to that this particular plot is no longer a heist; it's more of a rescue.However that still does not go over easy when people go flying into things or roll around in cars and handle walking it off only with a few scratches. Some of these particular events are simply impossible for the human body to withstand at once or all in one day. Sometimes it feels almost like a superhero movie because of how invulnerable some of these characters are portrayed. Again though, it's only for certain scenes. Stephen F. Windon again gives his audience the usual airy and spacious cinematography that almost every other entry in the franchise has received. Lots of road and aerial views for audiences to see how big of an issue these chase scenes get. The music is a puzzling choice however. Instead of Brian Tyler scoring the film, this time composer Lucas Vidal is doing the job. This is Vidal's only mainstream film score and to be honest it sounds a lot like Tyler's anonymous music. I guess Tyler was over scheduled for other films this time. Nothing sounds that much different though; it does sound good but not memorable in any way. It's just there like all the other scores to this franchise. All in all though it is still one of the better films.Justin Lin's latest entry contains lots of the same generic music and over-the-top action that feels physically flawed, yet it entertains better with Luke Evans' imposing presence and a story that is more about unity than it is about who has the faster car. Also after watching this, the confusing timeline will finally come into place.",breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,"Jan 19, 2015"
7,one of the better ones,"So, I am rewatching the fast movies again and this one is one of the better ones. Everyone says these guys are just street racers and how can they be this good or do these things but if you watch the movies in order they learn and become better in every movie. I like this one having some comedy and good action and if you just go into it with wanting to have fun and see Paul, Vin, and The Rock kick some ass then this movie is for you.",bosimmons-44782,"Nov 30, 2021"

8,Occupy that room for improvement!!,Based on the amount of running time I think the plot was well executed. Apart from a few goofs here and there I think the car chases were superb. Also the character would need to get facts right on cars especially the V12 American muscle! Most of the scenes repeat in terms of cars on the road which are seen on multiple scenes. The introduction of newer cars is also superb typically the Nissan Skyline driven by the Late Paul Walker. I think Hobbs role has also been well done. Many factual errors occur especially in the last bit of the tank scene and the chain that hangs on the bridge together with reality versus action. The Antonov also takes too long to lift thus causing an unrealistic situation concerning runway length. Its a great title but not necessarily for anyone obsessed with facts rather than fiction mostly on the last quarter. We would also have loved it better in 3D the 3rd dimension of things would bring a bit more realism and adrenalin. All the same I think that was nearly excellent. Good Work!!,lesolonkah,"Jan 17, 2014"
7,They got a tank.,"This story about super-heroic street racers is really about friendship, just like those enduring sci-fi geekouts. The purpose of all the fancy terminology and delirious spectacle is merely to make the essential information more understandable to a younger audience.In the same way, ""Fast & Furious 6,"" arguably the most sentimental of the ""Fast"" movies, is a case in point. All of the regular cast members are in their forties or close to it.This time, the former street racers and carjackers who have become the A-Team resurface to assist in a global counterterrorism manhunt. What could persuade these millionaires, who are now all residing in remote tropical hideaways, to assist the federal government?Although ""Fast 6"" is enjoyable, it could have been even better if it had acknowledged that human touch is uncommon and that once you have it, there is no need to keep clenching it into a fist.",Mysterygeneration,"Aug 25, 2022"
8,Good but not the best,"We're at the sixth movie of the high speed franchise. Dom and his gang are recruited to capture mercenaries who want to create a weapon that will destroy the world. I might as well tell you guys how I feel about the other movies. The first one is good, I know it's a Point Break rip off but it still feels different kinda like Home Alone 2. The second one is good or decent, not bad, I can write one or two paragraphs on this but I won't bother. The third one is decent for sure and it's the worst. It's a spin off, not exactly a sequel and it easily could have a straight to DVD movie. I allowed myself to see it three times and I won't watch it again. The fourth one is good and it's the first true sequel because Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are in it, not just one of them. The fifth one is the best, it's a heist movie and Dwayne Johnson's character Luke Hobbs is introduced. Back to Fast Six, it's bigger than the previous movie but not better. The plot is thin, it's bloated and Hobbs is no longer an antagonist. Before the premise was announced, I thought Hobbs would still be chasing Dom and his gang and maybe they would be forced to work together again. Hobbs is still interesting, he doesn't have any boring conversations with Dom but their previous relationship was better. Who knows, maybe they will become antagonists later on. The action is good and yeah it's ridiculous. Dom is like a superhero and the Iron Giant just popped into my head. There's no shaky cam bullshit and there a lack of CGI. The villain is insane mercenary Owen Shaw played by Luke Evans. He is cliché but still threatening. He doesn't say why he wants to destroy the world, maybe he feels some destruction will help improve the world later on. Unlike the last villain, he doesn't sit around doing paperwork, he drives around and hurts a few people. He smiles during the tank scene which shows he's sadistic. This movie is lighthearted, it's not gritty like Fast Four or the Dark Knight trilogy or the upcoming Need For Speed movie which I'm looking forward to. There are some jokes and most of them work. I didn't write this review earlier because I didn't feel like writing any reviews and I recently decided I should write some reviews because I enjoy writing. Fast Seven will be coming out on April 2015 and only time will tell if Brian will get killed off. James Wan is the director, Justin Lin dropped out because he naturally wants to do other movies. I read James wants the action to be more realistic and I like that idea. I also like Jason Statham who is playing the villain and I read he doesn't want to destroy the world. Okay I'm done yapping.",ty-jensen,"Dec 23, 2013"

If you want to watch a properly crap film then this is the film for you, and when the titles start rolling just run out of the cinema. The acting was pretty lame, and I am sick of seeing Dwayne Johnson in all of these sort of films. i haven't yet seen any of the previous Fast and Furious Films, but I do not plan on, judging by how bad this film was. i am quite glad that the next films in the series will have a new director, for humanities sake, I also think that a new cast, and crew, definitely a new writer, or even just cutting the films altogether would make a massive improvement!",edwardo-walsh,"May 24, 2013"

7,Amazing furious,"Selection of Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson, and the line-up of actors from the previous films makes this film very impressive. Through this film, viewers were exposed to what actually happened to Letty in the fourth film (Fast & Furious). The film begins with the introduction of the cast with gazette from the previous Fast franchise playing in the background. This is very creative as viewers get a glimpse of the previous story lines. The car chasing scene between DK and Han on the road of Tokyo and 'Jason Statham' appearance at the end of this film is not only surprising to the audience but also provides clear picture of what's happening and creating exciting new plot for this movie sequel which is also the sequel to The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift.",murgy86,"Sep 24, 2013"
6,Status quo,"""Fast & Furious 6"" gives the series' rabid fan base pretty much everything it could possibly wish for: an array of uber-expensive, souped-up racecars; a heavy helping of in-group camaraderie; a bunch of super-macho posturing (even from the women); a bevy of scantily-clad, slow-motion groupies; a moderate dose of tough-guy sentiment (nothing too girly though); a smidgen of comic relief; a raft of ear-piercing gun battles and, of course, the series' patented trademark, a whole mess of turbo-charged chase scenes.The plot - since contractual obligations demand there be one, I suppose - involves our favorite band of car racing outlaws (Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Sung Kang, Tyrese Gibson, et. al ) coming out of ""retirement"" in various foreign lands to help Dwayne Johnson's DSS agent take down an international heist gang in exchange for full immunity for the crew back in the States. There's a lot of talk about ""the family"" and much romantic palaver between Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez, but that's basically just filler between all the spectacular (if scarcely plausible) race sequences - which is as it should be when you're fast and furious.""Fast & Furious 6"" ends with one of those ""don't try this at home"" provisos, which in light of the recent tragic fate of series star Paul Walker, seems more vital and relevant than ever (not to mention ironically prescient).

7,Fast & Furious 6: Nitro in the Veins and Punches to the Jaw,"Ah, the return of the brothers of motor oil. When Dom Toretto says ""Family,"" you better brace yourself, because at any moment, he might drop a presidential-level speech between two high-octane chases. Here, Justin Lin isn't holding back. We've got a team of mercenaries straight out of a Call of Duty mission, chases that could make Mad Max blush, and fight scenes that hit harder than a shonen anime mid-power-up.Critics said they'd drifted too far from street racing? Buckle up and shut up, because this movie is fueled by nostalgia and diesel injected with Red Bull. The chases are choreographed like the final battle of Street Fighter, complete with mangled metal and explosions galore. Special shoutout to the tank scene-the moment you realize that gravity is just a suggestion Justin Lin chose to ignore.Between Vin Diesel delivering lines like an NPC in Skyrim and Dwayne Johnson slapping people so hard he could send Thanos into early retirement, the team is stacked. Add in the return of Letty, who we all thought was six feet under back in Episode 4 (like a video game boss who refuses to stay dead). Tyrese Gibson handles the one-liners, while Ludacris plays the tech genius hacking systems like he's Neo in The Matrix.If you're looking for deep dialogue, go watch Dead Poets Society. Here, conversations are just pit stops between stunts. The shootouts are as precise as an aimbot, the explosions are tuned to wake the dead, and the car chases... Think Mario Kart on cocaine with tanks and planes. Yeah, that's Fast & Furious 6.The real star of the movie? The concept of family. Dom could probably solve geopolitical conflicts with his speeches about how ""together, we're stronger."" It's borderline religious. You half-expect him to bless you with the holy trinity: Nitroglycerin, Fistfights, and Family. And somehow, it works. You'll find yourself getting misty-eyed during a reconciliation scene... until a truck explodes and reminds you why you're really here.Fast & Furious 6 is like a greasy kebab after a night of heavy drinking. It wrecks your stomach, but damn, it feels good. If you're craving deep reflection, go watch an indie film about Norwegian existentialism. But if you want flying cars, sweaty muscles, and explosions worthy of a Dragon Ball Z finale, then step on the gas. Dom Toretto is waiting, with a tank full of nitro.",OniFR,"Feb 8, 2025"

Since the first time I saw 'The Fast and The Furious' 12 years ago, I knew I found my car/mayhem fix. Although I never thought it would last to see iteration #6, I was more eager this time around than for the first. No surprises, besides the unpredictable nature of Owen Shaw. The only real curveball was the substantiation of an Internet rumor that Jason Statham joined 'Fast 6'. Well, sorta -- end credits. After the audience ""ooooohh's"" at Statham's revealing, I couldn't wait, yet again, for the 7th! Fun factoid: This movie marked the reuniting of 2 'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' characters.

6,Finally feelings took over the muscles,"We all know up to now Fast & Furious has been one of the most successful movie franchises. I remember the time when I watched the first part of Fast & Furious. I really fell in love with this movie! I loved every single detail about it: story line, actors (that was when I knew about Vin Diesel and Paul Walker and got addicted to them), cars, but mostly car races. Then there was the second part of Fast & Furious that was not less interesting and exciting. I thought there wouldn't be any continuation, but deep inside hoped for that. And then, some years later, Universal Pictures announced the release of Fast & Furious 3, then 4, and 5. I was anxious to see those parts and loved them. But, frankly speaking, already starting with Fast & Furious 4 I was getting bored. There were less and less new things in the movie and it looked like this franchise started to be exhausted. With the release of the 5th part, honestly, I hoped it would be the end. But, as you know, this year we saw Fast & Furious 6.I admit, I expected too much from this part. I believed the director and producer would add some new things, new intrigues, but in reality everything was the same, just like in previous series. Here the story repeats again: in order to get freedom and clear his crew's criminal records Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) has to cooperate with the agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) to help him to take down a criminal organization led by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) and in which Dom's presumed-dead ex-girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is involved. Of course, there are fights with superman deeds (for example, when Dom saves Letty from falling out of the track), a bit of car races, shoot-outs, some humor scenes. Everything is just like in previous parts. But at the same time there are some attempts, unexpected though, to insert into the story line moral and human notions, such as love, feeling, freedom, betrayal, friendship. I can't say it worked. For me it looked a bit awkward. Imagine the scene where the fight is at its highest point and suddenly a jockstrap declares his love to the girl (the moment when Dom is talking to Letty when he finally meets her). And there are lots of such scenes. What I am trying to say is that for many people Fast & Furious is an action movie where people are not only used, but they require action, a lot of action. And now the director in order to prolong the existence of this franchise tries to turn it in some kind of soap opera by adding all this moral and emotional elements that don't match at all even with the characters. When you expect tough races and fights, but instead you get gentleness and tears – this is a bit confusing and disappointing and even boring.Well, my general opinion is that Fast & Furious has exhausted. It doesn't have anything new to suggest to its audience. Now, this movie is not about the cars and action, but about the morality. So, if you want to see a film full of fights and intrigues, you'd better chose something different. And I don't think the 7th part will be different, don't have any expectations from it. But we will see",eatakmakova,"Dec 30, 2013"

7,Film #6: Letty's rescue mission that takes the franchise to England and Spain.,"This was a solid entry and film number six in the Fast and the Furious franchise. It joins Brian and Mia in The Canary Islands for the birth of their son Jack...and it brings Federal agent Hobbs back to ask for help taking down a new bad guy by the name of Shaw (Luke Evans). Why would Dom and his crew help out? They are rich and in countries with no extradition treaties with the U. S....but Hobbs brings a photo of Letty alive and well. That is all it takes and the crew is reassembled to join Hobbs in London for a one time opportunity to rescue Letty and get pardons.Great stunts, a cameo by singer Rita Ora, fun comedy like the vending machine bit, and the crew back together are what make this a must see for fans of the franchise. This film reunites Dom, Hobbs, Brian, Mia, Roman, Tej, Han, Elena and Gisele with appearances by Stasiak and Braga for franchise fans. (Oh! And a big call back to the first film and 1327.) I actually really liked how they started this film with a little visual run through of all the films in the series thus far. It was fun to see and helped everyone get on the same page as far as what has come before.Typical hot cars and muscle cars...but new to this entry a tank and a cargo plane. They seem to be upping the ante with bigger and bigger bad guys. Shaw is the mastermind behind some plot to take down the world...almost James Bond villain-y, in fact there is even a Bond joke thrown in. Which was appropriate since they were in England. By the way I loved seeing a British pawn shop.Must see for fans of the franchise and still probably a recommendation for fans of action films. This probably will not topple my favs in this franchise...but might still beat Tokyo drift and the second film which introduces Roman in Miami.My order of favorites in the Fast and The Furious Franchise:
1. Remains the most memorable and the tightest story...the original The Fast and The Furious film in LA
2. Film #5 The whole crew reunited in Brazil
3. Film #4 Letty's revenge and Brian and Don's reunion back in LA
4. Film #6 Letty's rescue...Brian and Mia are parents, England and Spain
5. Film #3 Tokyo drift aka the franchise goes back to high school, Japan
6. Film #2 Roman's introduction, Miami.",cgvsluis,"May 31, 2023"

But still absolutely ridiculously stupid & can barely be called a film.Not sure what we are supposed to take less seriously: Paul Walker's acting, Vin Deisel's monotone delivery, or that this is the 6th one of these pieces of garbage. Is this all Hollywood has to offer us these days? Reboots, remakes, and sequels? May as well continue the theme of making board games into major motion pictures because this is just absolutely horrendous. Fast and Furious is slowly becoming the Police Academy of our time.

7,The best of the whole franchise!,"I have seen all the movies and this one is always my favorite! It's thrilling to watch it scene. You think the movie is done at the end but they have a complete twist that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
Paul Walker is always an enjoyment to see, Vin Diesel not so much. I hated how he had no emotion in every scene. I remember seeing him in the Pacifier and he had so much energy when acting. It's just a disappointment. There weren't any stand out actors/actresses in this film.
The fights scenes were insane and awesome. Everyone did a great job. The scene with the tank was pretty unreal when watching it. However, the one scene I hated was when they killed off a character that had more meaning than the others to another character.

They tweaked the formula, and suddenly a franchise of over-glorified music videos became entertaining popcorn flicks. No, the plots aren't great, the dialog is cliché and the acting won't win any awards (unless you count The Razzies), but I can't recall having more fun watching a straight-up action movie in a long, long time. A lot of it doesn't make any sense if you think about it too hard, but then again it's a Summer action movie. You're not SUPPOSED to think too hard. My advice; Buckle-up and enjoy.

7,"Good fun, as far as you don't compare it to Fast Five","After having watched the trailer to the new addition in this exciting, edge of the seat action, it immediately went on my list of 'Must watch' titles. 2013 had a lot of interesting films coming out, but after the post credit scene of Fast Five, which according to me was the perfect action film that would appeal to almost everyone, with its great cast, heart pumping car races and solid plot, I obviously had big expectations for this one...But having said that, the first half of the film was a bit of a let down. I understand that they wanted to re-establish the characters, and try and emphasize on the concept of 'we don't turn our backs on family', but I'm not sure that's what audience usually expect in the Fast and Furious franchise. And the villain gang, despite it's potential, weren't established properly, and we didn't get much of a chance to create an opinion on them. With the slight disappointment of the first half, there came the second, which made up for all the lack of cars and speed up until that point. And it was completely worth it. Here, I can say that the trailer didn't show all the best parts, and there was way more to 'They got a tank' and the super cool scene with the car bursting out from the plane. As far as the cast goes, Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson were great playing their tough guy roles and they did fairly succeed in their attempt to match the Dom-Hobbs face off from the predecessor. Michelle Rodriguez reminded us what we felt was missing in the series after she was assumed dead. All in all, it was good fun, and does prove to be entertaining despite it's flaws; as far as you don't compare it to its predecessor. And watch out, for this one has a surprise ending as well, and you will not be disappointed (This time placed before the entire end credits, so you shouldn't miss it, like you probably did in Fast Five...not unlike me)",sanjna-polamarasetty,"Jun 9, 2013"
6,Same movie over and over again,"This is the sixth installment in the Fast and the Furious franchise, so fastened your seats and enjoy this 2 hour and 10 minute thrill ride that has real movie car chases at top speeds, real movie stunts and join Toretto and his gang as they go on a high stakes adventure through Picadilly Circus, Moscow, the Canary Islands, Tokyo and Hong Kong. There's British guy who wants to buy their old-fashioned garage car business while their in England and Russian villain who doesn't want them to have a happy ending. The cast includes Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Chris Ludarcis Bridges, Dwayne the Rock Johnson, Tyrese Gibson, Michelle Rodgrieuz, and Sung Kang. The film feels rushed but that's alright by me, it's supposed to feel rushed and fast. I really enjoyed this movie, you got supercops and supercriminals going way over their heads and keeping it cool and straight and out of the jailbox. The cinematography and camera-work is outstanding and the sound effects are vroom. This is even better than ""Fast Five"" and better than that movie ""Erased"" that I saw on On Demand. What I learned about this movie is that if you trash a old-fashioned car and you could always put it back together again or fix it with the powerful mechanics and tools we have today.",jpc8024-956-993529,"May 28, 2013"

7,Still enjoyable but not on par with 5; Would Recommend,"Directed by Justin LinStarring Paul Walker, Vin Disel and Dwayne JohnsonPlot Overview: ​At the slight chance of his presumed dead girlfriend to be alive, Dominic Torretto(Vin Disel) gathers his old crew to find his love, and stop terrorist Owen Shaw(Luke Evans).While I did enjoy this, I think that it tried too hard to improve on things that didn't need improving. Granted it helped in some areas, such as the villains, but that doesn't mean everything needed improving. It does have its moments and when it shines, it shines, but it's not as good as 5. It is better than 1-4 and I can recommend you seeing it but I just feel it wanted to go bigger and better but only went bigger, and that thought hurt the film.The story for this movie was over-bloated and it tried to go bigger than 5 but that harmed the movie. I really enjoyed 5 partly because it was Torretto and co doing what they do best and the fact it was just a great, fun heist movie that mixed the franchise up. 6 tried to turn them into international spies which tries to give bigger stakes and make the movies seem more grander than what they are. I do like how they attempt to interconnect all the movies 'individual stories' which one 'overarching narrative' and think it was pretty smart to do so.Paul Walker was decent as Brian O'Connor. Vin Disel was not good as Dominic Torretto and I don't think lightning can strike twice. Dwayne Johnson was great as Hobbs and is still the stand out character. Michelle Rodriguez was fine as Letty but her twist was pretty lazily handled, as far as I'm concerned. Luke Evans was good as Owen Shaw and made Shaw the first good villain in the franchise. Technically, the movie was passable. Some of the effects were pretty great but aside from that the cinematography and whatnot was fine.This movie needed to provide fun action scenes and set pieces. This movie had SIX movies of bad villains weighing on its shoulders and it managed to create a passable villain in the form of Owen Shaw but it still felt like they were trying too hard.In conclusion, this movie has some enjoyable moments and I do recommend you see it but it doesn't hold a candle to 5 but I suppose it couldn't live up to it.7/10Would Recommend",EthanBJones_03,"May 16, 2017"
8,Money well spent and waiting for the next part :),"Yes, this movie had a lot of clichés, but they can be ignored by the fast paced and the grasping screenplay. Great direction. This can be called a complete movie as it has all the essential elements like comedy, action, drama etc. If you are an emotional fool, then yes this movie is for you too. :P Regarding the history of the series, it would be helpful if you have seen the previous parts of the series, before watching this movie. I won't say much about it, you should go for it. Though it is a one time watch, but it is worth every penny and the time that you will spend on it. The bottom line, You won't be disappointed after watching this movie. This movie has done justice to the series and the expectations. And don't walk out of the theater as soon as you see the credits coming, because there is a BIG and i mean BIIIIIIIGGG surprise coming. And all i can say now is that the next part is going to be legen- wait for it(literally)- dary(hopefully) So, anyways go for it. Great movie. 8/10",patial93,"May 26, 2013"

5,"They started out defying traffic laws, now they defy gravity laws.","It is not good but nor is it bad. Fast and Furious 6 is a bit above average movies that was flawed. I found the story predicable and cliché. It was pretty much unoriginal from a person having amnesia to a person who betrays the groups. Also, too much was going on and after one thing got fixed more problems came in when it should of just ended at that point. It is also really stupid when the villain is right in front of your eyes who you are trying to capture and yet you let him go and wait another time for the real deal. The story is not as clean as the last one but is it far better than the earlier movies of this franchise. I also found the dialogue ridiculous and unnecessary and kept on face palming each time they add a line. As for the positives, obviously the action scenes were awesome especially the plane scene at the end. Also, make sure to stay after the credits, it will give you clues to what F&F7 is going to be and possible villain for 7. Overall, Fast and Furious 6 is a mediocre movie that is worth a one time watch. Nothing really special but if someone wants some action this is the movie to watch. Not the best so far this summer but neither is it the worst. Fast Five will remain the best of the series.",gee_lok,"May 18, 2013"
6,London Baby!,"Who would have thought back in 2001 that The Fast and the Furious would somehow because a movie series that would last to six movies with a seventh on the way? Even more surprising the Fast and Furious series has become of the premier action series and being one of Universal Studios' biggest cashcows.After the Rio heist all of Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew have gone their separate ways and now multi-millionaires. But despite longing for a quiet life they are brought back into action when Diplomatic Security Service Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) gets the crew to help him stop a former British SAS officer turned mercenary Owen Shaw (Luke Shaw) who has been target military convoys in Europe to make a tech bomb. Hobbs has a big incentive for Toretto to go back into action by having proof his girlfriend and long-time love Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) is still alive and working for Shaw. With the crew in London car chases and fighting eschews.The appeal of The Fast and Furious films since Justin Lin has taken over the direction of the series has been his championing of practical effects. Whilst there is some CGI (which isn't particularly good) Fast 6 is still a feat of stunt work, fight sequences and in camera effects. Lin does know how to direct an action sequences, giving us an excellent car chase in London, the tank chase in its full ridiculousness and the final sequence involving a military transport plane (even if it takes place on the world's longest runway). Gina Carano and Joe Taslim from Haywire and The Raid were both added to the cast, bringing their fighting talents to the series and they are fine additions. Taslim has an excellent fight with Tyrese Gibson and Sung Kang in Waterloo Station (though it wasn't really filmed in Waterloo Station). I was disappointed by the fight between Carano and Rodriguez but that is because of the fight was shown in the trailers and it was intercut to much with the Taslim fight.Fast and Furious 6 has a massive cast with some members getting more attention then others. The big winners were Diesel and Johnson; both are massive screen presence with charisma and have the action chops. Johnson steals the shows once again, being a mass of muscle with one-liners and plenty of action ability: it is impressive the casting director was able to find a man bigger then The Rock so the pair could fight. Walker is his usual bland self and Joanna Bowster gets the shaft again, this time holding the baby. Carano is a woman of action and little words and Gibson is the comic relief to the point he was a bit annoying.A problem with the series has been the villains have been lacklustre. Evans is a man who is servable in the role and he is the best villain so far simply because he does feel more of a threat because he is a man of action himself, getting involved in the frontline, being a driver and a skilled martial artist: it is better then a middle aged crime lord with a load of heavies. But Fast 7 will have a better a villain with the post credit scene setting up the sequel.Whilst the action seemed like a step up from the Fast Five, the story is so much sillier. The Fast and Furious series has never been know for being strong storytelling but at least with Fast Five it felt a believable that these characters would attempt a massive heist, but Fast and Furious 6 was much more of a stretch just to reunite the team and get them working with Hobbs who has quickly become a fans favourite. The crew has shown to be expert investigators suddenly. We have American characters going round the more seedy side of London; they would be very noticeable very quickly. And as a Brit I do take it personally when the film used outdated stereotypes of British people like the snotty salesman.Like Fast Five, Fast and Furious 6 is long and baggy, but this problem felt more prominent as the film tried to give anyone a moment to shine and there were sequences that could have been cut. One example is when O'Conner goes undercover in a prison in Los Angeles which was just a plot cul-de-sac and reference more to Fast and Furious (which was a forgettable entry). It needed a re-write to just tighten thinks up because the running time could have been under two hours. Fast and Furious 6 is surprising convoluted for what is supposed to be a simple action flick.Funs of the series with be very satisfied with the sixth entry and on an action level it is solid. It is good to see practical effects in an action film. But it mindless and silly and it unlikely to appeal to detectors. Still the seventh film should be interesting just because of the villain.",freemantle_uk,"May 31, 2013"

7,A Thrilling Ride of Absurdity and Entertainment,"Fast and Furious 6 is a rollercoaster ride of action, absurdity, and entertainment. Despite its numerous unrealistic and ridiculous scenes, the film manages to hold itself together with a strong and engaging story. Overall, I would give it a solid 7/10.The story revolving around Letty's regaining of her memory is captivating and emotionally resonant. The relationship between Brian and Mia continues to evolve in a manner that is both realistic and endearing. Additionally, the introduction of Deckard Shaw at the end of the film sets the stage for an exciting sequel.Moreover, the film sees the return of one of my favorite Non-Toretto Crew characters, Luke Hobbs, played by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. His presence adds an extra layer of badassery to the already impressive cast. Furthermore, Owen Shaw's conniving and charismatic personality is a delight to watch, making him a compelling villain.However, there were some elements of the film that I found to be less impressive. The movie's handling of Giselle's death is disappointing, with the story quickly moving on from it without giving the audience time to process or feel the loss. Furthermore, the tank battle on the highway and the final battle on the military airfield are so unrealistic that they become absurd and entertaining in a way that takes away from the film's overall serious tone. These scenes are so stupid that it's fun to laugh at how unrealistic the nature of them all are Lmao.For instance, the idea that a single car, no matter how advanced, could feasibly pull down an entire military cargo plane, even if it's carrying maximum weight, is laughable. Similarly, the notion that a tank, which is designed for heavy artillery and armored combat, could be taken down by a single car is far-fetched, even by Fast and Furious standards.In conclusion, Fast and Furious 6 is an enjoyable movie that is worth watching, even if it does require the viewer to suspend their disbelief. Its entertaining and engaging story, along with its exciting action scenes, make it a worthy addition to the franchise. However, its unrealistic and ridiculous elements, particularly the tank battle and final battle, may be off-putting to some viewers.",douglasc11,"Jan 6, 2025"

Not for their average script or kind-of-okay acting. THEY GIVE WHAT THEY PROMISE YOU!The Acting: It was okay! They really didn't need to express many emotions, besides Angry, happy, sad and... ready-to-race-ish. The actors did their job well enough. 7/10 for the actingThe story/script: The story didn't have many layers. There are some plot twists you might not expect. But you don't expect them because you probably don't care enough about the characters involved in the twists. 7/10 for the story. They did tie up the third and the fourth to this one, which I think was a pleasant surprise though.The scenery: They chose some amazing places to shot at! London, Spain, a little bit of their old house back in the USA. The movie was very well filmed! 9/10The action sequences: Wow! Amazing! The list of actors contained THE ROCK, Vin freaking diesel, but you won't find ""Mr. Gravity"" in there! They were great shot, amazing performed and the CGI was very well used. I could not have wished for better action scenes! 10/10 for sure!#tank #plane #therock #awesomeComedy: Their was some comedic relief and It actually didn't feel forced at all. It worked very well!In general: This movie delivers exactly what you're hoping for! I would pay to see it again on the big screen! 9/10 FOR SURE!

Not only are the F&F movies fun and great popcorn entertainment they don't insult your intelligence like the Transformers or Battleship type blockbusters do.Vin Diesel and Paul Walker have great chemistry together as the leads for the series. Great to see one of the original 4 characters of Michelle Rodriguez back in the fold. Her lack of presence was missing in Fast Five. Don't get me wrong Fast Five was a great movie even without her but the Brian, Dom, Mia and Letty characters make it feel like a true F&F movie. Without one of the 4 main characters it takes away from the F&F feel of the movie. That's probably why Tokyo Drift was the weakest of all the F&F movies.",Maniac-9,"May 28, 2013"

Literally just sat on the edge of your seat. Nail biting.. Always wondering what type of brilliant action would you get next!Once the film had finished. I was completely blown away it was that amazing! So much better than the fifth one! Even though we looked like idiots because we were the only ones who did it, me and my dad stood up after and clapped! I'd say we were both happy to spend our money to see this!Everyone who is in this film pulls off their role as a character so brilliantly!

If I had a cold beer in my hand I would raise my glass to the cast of this unbelievably brilliant film!I really do recommend this to anyone who is a big fan of the fast and furious series.. Take it from a guy with experience who has been there and done that. You will be blown away by it all.

8,Love these movies,"Fast and Furious won't let you down. Even it is a 6th installment on this series it still rocks. Movie is turbo loaded popcorn entertainmet loaded with testosteroine and smell of gas. The story isn't the brightest, but that can easilly forgive because this movie is exactly what you are waiting for. Movie is full of great action scenes which are so exaggeration that you can only laugh for them. Thankfully movie doesn't take itself too seriously, you understand that at the latest when Dwayne Johnson is to be called as a sumerian Thor. With the previous movie I was hoping that next movie get it's bad guy from Jason Statham. It didn't became truth in this movie, but the end scene promises that Jason Statham will be the bad guy in next installment. Can't wait to see that.

5,A lost opportunity.,"The movie was big. It had a large scale. It had good actors and a big budget. But poor direction and bad story left it as a more than disappointing experience. The director seems to not have even the basic grasp of elementary physics. My woes arise from the many lost opportunities. There are many movies out there which have a shitty storyline, but great action to make up for it (Die Hard 5 comes to mind). But this couldn't even achieve that. The action choreography seemed to have been done by a child playing with action figures. The movie is plagued with bad dialogues and stupid attempts at comedy. Frankly, the only thing positive about the movie is the cast. Overall, it is not worth your money.",Krennex,"May 25, 2013"

8,A guilty pleasure.,"Everyone has something they enjoy that they really shouldn't. Lance had drugs, Tiger had women who weren't his wife and I have the F&F franchise. Thankfully my guilty pleasure won't get me into trouble, just weird looks from those who know I have zero interest in cars in real life. But that's the joy of this series: it's a souped-up fantasy with no interest in being grounded. With physics, common sense and realism all gleefully thrown out of the window, returning director Justin Lin concocts an awesome array of ludicrous vehicular set-pieces and bone- crunching fights, accompanied with tongue-in-cheek humour and amusing references to past Fast flicks. The cast know they are on a good wicket with this seemingly invincible franchise and are clearly having a blast. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker lap up the opportunity to play their most popular roles once again, Michelle Rodriguez is back in the part that made her big, Gina Carano and Luke Evans get in on the fun, whilst Dwayne ""Samoan Thor"" Johnson again commands your undivided attention as law enforcer Hobbs.

10,Loved it!,"As great as the original Fast & Furious! High adrenaline and fast cars. Who would have guessed they would have put so much time into the storyline along with the time they put in these actor's appearances. It is a great movie for those adults & young adults who have grown up with these movies. Due to the fighting and drug cartel references not a great movie for kids. This is a movie you would want to leave the kiddos home with a babysitter as you enjoy it. Upbeat, high energy, and will leave you smiling! This is a great movie to watch with the full impact of the movie theater experience. An absolute must see! Never a dull moment!",Groovercare,"Jun 9, 2013"
1,Movie was terrible. Don't waste your money.,"Horrible movie. The action sequences were weak and unbelievably bad. The acting was some of the worst I have ever seen and don't even get me started on the generic repetitive storyline. Even for an action movie, this was incredibly boring. They have been milking this series so long that it's barely lactating. Please, do yourself a favor and don't watch this piece of trash movie. Only good part was after the credits.The dialogue suffers from generic lines spat out from other movies and the plot armor on the characters is so obvious that there's no tension because you already know which can and can't die. The series is so afraid of losing one of the main characters that they make all the effort to revive them just to please the crowd that is obsessed with that specific character. So many of the scenes are just unbelievably bad and ignore every single law of physics. While watching the movie, I was hoping time would speed up because there was literally nothing to look forward to in this movie. The plot didn't get better throughout the movie and felt very stale. Slow progression and overall too long.",Zetram,"Jun 8, 2013"

8,Pedal To The Metal!,"Hell yeah!! Now this is the movie to go see in theaters!! Hearing those loud car engines roaring,screaming, and rushing makes my ears tickle in excitement!! The cars are sexy and the Toretto family is still kicking in gear in a another action pack adrenaline rush manhunt.You think the movie will start off slow but, oh no it cuts right to the chase to not leave the viewer bored. Not only its filled with action ,but good humor as well. Especially, Roman who kept the audience filled with laughter mostly every scene he is in. I loved how The Rock simply kicks so much ass even when he is standing still giving orders. Very glad to see he is in the pack again. A great character to the franchise. Vin Diesel is still the same old Vin we all knew from the previous Fast and The Furious movies ,but pairs up with The Rock which makes it even better.Very good movie you wouldn't want to miss in theaters. Also extra ending at the end of the movie will blow you away!!",SuperRev9,"May 27, 2013"

9,First time seeing any in series,"I had never seen any of the Fast and Furious movies and I say this one by mistake, and I am glad I did. I believe they did a good job at explain the back story for first time watchers. Will defiantly be watching the other 5! For me there was a little to much unrealistic parts but I believe that is what happens with any high budget action movie. Like I said this was my first Fast and Furious movie so I am not sure if every actor has been in every movie but I believe you can truly tell that they have an almost family like bond between the cast and even the crew. I believe that, the fact that they have this relationship with each other truly adds to the movie. Now I could be 100% wrong and they could just all hate each other and be great actors.",sweetcocoman,"Jul 11, 2013"
10,"""Fast & Furious 6"" is the Best Movie of 2013!","""Fast & Furious"" franchise is like a volcano. It may take a rest, but when it erupts, it BOOMS! Hell, yes! This is the sixth movie and the pure action, pure adventure, some romance, some comedy, and some drama go full speed. With the perfect mix, I hereby declare that this is my best movie of 2013!Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) offer Dom (Vin Diesel), Brian (Paul Walker), and their team full pardons on their crimes if they will help bring down a group of mercenary drivers lead by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). Car chases and fight scenes--bring them in! I love to see them with amazing soundtrack and great editing. Fight scenes with crazy stunts are pure pleasure! Like how the trailer shows, expect a badass catfight between Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and Riley (Gina Carano), some chaos and mayhem in London, and that insane runway scene where cars try to stop it. I know that that runway scene may defy some laws of physics, but come on! This is a fictional movie, not a scientific documentary. Be fair! We're watching this movie for pure enjoyment. And also, watch out for some emotional scenes, because I didn't see them coming.I've to watch ""Furious 7"" in the future. Vin Diesel said they'll make eighth, ninth, and tenth films. Jesus, I'm so excited for these movies! I seriously can't wait!",AdrianOlonan,"Jul 17, 2015"

This movie franchise is all about cars and crazy stunts and well ya about cars. f**k the story story is secondary when we watch this fast and furious series it's all about gorgeous racing cars.. You want story go watch pearl seven borne. You don't go for story when you watch Stepup franchise all you care is freaking dance.. so to the people who did't like this movie you did't see what actually the director wanted you to look.If the movie had story primary then people would be bitching about ""there weren't enough cars in there franchise forgot what this series is all about"".get over it. Conclusion:Movies was awesome one of the best of the franchise. cars were new not seen early in any movies.cleared the tokyo drift ending connection.

10,"The action in Furious 6 is bigger and better than ever, a memorable and entertaining action film - My Ultimate Review","Fast & Furious 6 has Justin Lin returning as director and Chris Morgan returning as writer. It is the sequel to Fast Five and the sixth installment in the Fast Saga. Furious 6 has a lot of horse power, it never slows down and that's what I expect from this franchise. Fast Five is my personal favorite but F6 goes deeper in the huge story Chris Morgan and the writer team came up with and it's great. The story isn't anything extraordinary but it's entertaining, the characters and the chemistry they have are how this film like the others work so well, and of course its action and big action sequences which gets bigger in each installment. The producers and writers approached Furious 6 with the aim to transform the franchise further, incorporating elements of spy and adventure film, in the hopes of increasing audience numbers further and it certainly did. I wouldn't say it fits the first film but it fits what Justin Lin and Chris Morgan set up in Fast Five. It's also nice to see they're going back to previous story arcs and plot from previous movies, this film has many characters from previous movies.Fast & Furious 6 follows a professional criminal gang led by Dominic Toretto, who are offered amnesty for their crimes by the U. S. Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs, in exchange for helping him take down a skilled mercenary organization led by Owen Shaw, one member of which is Toretto's former lover Letty Ortiz who was presumed dead.Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Sung Kang, Gal Gadot, Elsa Pataky and John Ortiz returns. Whilst Luke Evans and Jason Statham gets introduced as the Shaw Brothers, Statham has only a cameo role in this film but it sets up for the sequel and his appearance in Tokyo Drift, Luke Evans plays Owen Shaw, a former British SAS soldier who leads a group of skilled mercenaries to steal high-tech devices worth billions on the black market. It's also nice to see Michelle Rodriguez back as Letty Ortiz after her ""death"" in Fast & Furious 3, she's a great character and brilliantly played by Michelle. What's interesting with her character arc in this film is how she's working for Shaw which makes him and his crew more likeable and not looked as villains. Letty have suffered from amnesia ever since her ""death"", I'm usually not a big fan of the amnesia plot point but it works well in this film and it's thanks to the writers.I have written it in my earlier reviews but the editing in these films are impressive, the editing for the car races and scenes with cars is where it's the best. But the editing deserves a lot of praise, the pacing too is great. Good cinematography and some very nice camera work, the action scenes are shot so nice. The shaky cam at some parts of the movie was decent, I'm not a super fan of it but for those who like it, it's used well. Production design is impressive, the scale is massive and watching behind the scenes of how they created it is something I recommend for every fan.The creators and masterminds behind the Fast Saga turns the action up a notch and what we get are dangerous yet entertaining stunts and action that makes you sit on the edge of your seat. The tank sequence is simply astonishing and one action sequence that will forever be among of my favorite action sequences of all time. Then there is many smaller ones but the end sequence is something to talk about, oh yes, the plane sequence. It's quite mind blowing how they managed to create them, on paper I can guess it looks simple but when it comes to executing the stunt sequences it's far from easy. Some actors even do the stunts themselves and how everything or mostly everything is practical is what is astonishing to me. The Fast & Furious franchise have grown more and more into the action genre and this film is pure action from start to finish. Even some martial arts which I liked a lot. Seriously a phenomenal action movie.",Holt344,"Jun 18, 2021"

2,Complete and utter rubbish.,"Believability of this movie is on par with XXX (Triple X). As someone already said, there is unnecessary fight between allies that no one else but them sees. The part where Vin catapults himself out of his car to catch his girlfriend is... well.. I was pretty certain such scenes died out from movies ten years ago, but no. The movie is insult to intelligence. I came to check it on IMDb expecting to see not more than 4, and finding the people value it 7.4 is just another proof you quite often can't believe IMDb rates, both high and low. Watch it with your kids if you must, but be prepared for some royal punching in your believability synapses.",tompaxy,"Jul 11, 2013"
8,Furious 6,"While most franchises lose their steam with each succeeding sequel, the Fast and the Furious franchise is that rare exception where its later films breathe in new life into the series. Once a franchise about car racing, ""Fast Five"" took an unexpected turn as a bank heist thriller in the vein of Steven Soderbergh's ""Ocean's 11,"" a welcomed change as seen by its huge box office earnings and critical success. Now, ""Furious 6"" is neither about car racing nor bank heists, but rather a terrorist threat with obvious inspirations from ""The Dark Knight."" Like ""Fast Five,"" the results are immensely satisfying and undeniably entertaining.The key to the franchise's upward turn in quality is due to director Justin Lin. He is a skilled action director, and many filmmakers can learn a few things or two from him: The action sequences are impressive, engaging, comprehensible, and well-shot, with practical effects to boot. There is a sense of danger, verve, and life in these scenes rarely found in other films, despite how over-the-top and ridiculous they may be; and yes, they often drift into gratify-defying territory. While I usually don't react out loudly when watching a film, this film had me gasping, jaw dropping, laughing, and applauding, sometimes all at once!Another ingredient to the film's success is the chemistry between the cast members. We have grown to love these characters over the course of the series that one cannot help but cheer on for them. In particular, Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous have such a terrific rapport with each other that they provide some of the film's biggest laughs and memorable one-liners. Additionally, Luke Evans is definitely a step up above the previous film's antagonist, and Gina Carano provides some great ass-kicking moments, although not much performance-wise. On another note, I want to mention how refreshing it is to see minority actors fill these roles. Certainly, the film's use of a diverse ensemble cast should be commended. As for the story, it's nothing special, but I dare you not to act surprised when several plot twists are revealed; I did so more than I would like to admit.If there's one thing to learn about this franchise, it's that some change can be a good thing. While the later sequels do focus away from the car racing, they still featured cars, which helped retain old fans while bringing in new ones. ""Furious 6"" is terrific entertainment, and judging by yet another dazzling cliffhanger and the audience's reaction, ""Fast & Furious 7"" will be an amazing finale for the series. Unfortunately, Justin Lin won't be back around for the last installment, but someone please get this man to direct every and all upcoming action flicks.",dilipbts,"Jun 10, 2020"

8,Furious 6,"The movie is faster than ever, it's a popcorn flick just like the previous one but that doesn't stop it from being great and being a lot of fun.The movie gets pretty much straight to the point with ironing out the plot which was teased at the end of Fast Five. The team from Fast Five face there biggest challenge yet and Domonic (Vin Diesel) has to secure what he loves most while trying to look out for his friends and family.The movie has some great action scenes with humor all the way through it, mainly from Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous and the odd one liners from Vin Diesel and Sung Kang. Despite very far fetched action which was crazily unrealistic at times it still didn't take away the fun, it just left you feeling, how the hell is that possible? That was my only real gripe with the movie but lets not forget, if these movies didn't have that sort of action that makes your jaw hit the floor in disbelief they'd be no where near as fun of enjoyable. I also was kind of let down by the bad guy in this film, maybe it's because I watched Star Trek Into Darkness and Benedict Cumberland was amazing as the villain, but really Luke Evan's was quite disappointing.Vin Diesel is as awesome as ever, mainly due to him pulling off the super-human activities like they were nothing. Paul Walker didn't really do much for me though but the rest of the character really do put a great shift in. So really the cast were good for what they were in it for.Overall I'd definitely go see this movie if you enjoyed any of the previous ones because this is on par with Fast Five, which for me was probably the best one. Enjoy this movie for what it is and don't go into the theater expecting to see Oscar worthy performances.I'll give it an 8. It's great fun and really enjoyable, it will leave you wanting to ride your car through the streets as fast as you can.",dineshaishu,"Jul 29, 2019"

This movie grabs and holds your attention as you go for ""fast and furious"" ride with the now familiar group of guys and gals who are tough on the outside and strong and good on the inside. This is Michelle Rodriguez's best movie to date. She is a wonderful actress and delivers another great performance, and dominates her scenes. The rest of the cast is excellent too. Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson once again team up to create a lot of excitement. The story itself is great. It contains almost nonstop action interspersed with clever lines. The good guys are good and the bad guys are bad. Luke Evans delivers a strong performance as the lead bad guy, Shaw. Although the story is far-fetched and stretches the boundaries of plausibility, still it works, and as a result is entertaining, and for that reason alone this movie is worth watching.",PWNYCNY,"May 28, 2013"
8,"Not the best one, but could have been worse.","Fast & Furious 6 is the sequel to Fast Five (2011) and the sixth installment of the FAST & THE FURIOUS franchise. This film was in development by February 2010 as the first film in the series to move away from the underground car-racing theme of the previous films in the series which was considered to have placed a barrier on audience numbers. The film was released on May 24th, 2013 and grossed over $780 million dollars worldwide.The plot follows Dominic Toretto and his crew who has retired following their successful heist in the fifth film, but remain wanted fugitives until they return to the USA at the end of this film. USS Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs offers to clear their records and allow them to return home in exchange for helping him to take down a skilled mercenary organization led by Owen Shaw, one member of which Toretto's presumed-dead lover Letty Ortiz. They save Letty, but Mia is kidnapped by Shaw's team and this leads into a super-intense conclusion.The story is really well-thought out, but there are a few flaws but that does not stop this movie from being really good. Some of the dialog does not make any sense, but some of the jokes and dialog by the cast makes a lot of sense in some of the movie really cool. A few lines are also really quotable lines especially with our main antagonist when he reminds Dom and the crew saying, ""This code you live by, is the very reason why you weren't even in the game."" The action is a little over-the-top but it stills keeps me interested. However, the second car chase in the middle of the film was way too destructive in this film, but I really liked it though. But did you really had to try and kill Letty by throwing her off a tank? No. I will admit, the ending 12 or 14 minute climactic car-chase sequence is pretty awesome with a mix of CGI, pre-visualization, stunt work and live-action footage.The acting is a little confusing, but I will give credit to our main actors: Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner, Dwayne Johnson as Luke Hobbs, Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz, Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto, Sung Kang and Gal Gadot as Han Seoul-Oh and Gisele Yashar, Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous as Roman Peace and Tej Parker and of course, Elsa Pataky, Chris Hemsworth's real life wife, as Elena Neves. They all do a good job. John Ortiz returns as Braga and he does a good job, but he is only in the prison scenes. Gina Carano plays Riley and she does a great job as a villain, at the end, but even then she's a mixed-martial arts fighter and her performance is over-the-top in a few areas, but she keeps me interested in her character until she is killed by Letty.Our villain is British newcomer, Luke Evans as the role of Owen Shaw, the brother of the next villain, who is revealed as Han's killer at the end of this film in a post-credits scene that sets up FURIOUS 7 fantastically as the evil Deckard Shaw, who calls Dominic with a threatening message: ""Dominic Toretto, you don't know me. But you're about to."" The music is composed by Lucas Vidal and I am confused because I like Brian Tyler's musical score for the other films in the series, even Furious 7. I don't like half of Vidal's score, but I am glad some of Brian Tyler's music is present in this film.Also, I am very sad to see Gisele die. That part when Gal Gadot's character sacrifices herself to save Sung Kang's character, Han was a little bit over-the-top. Also, we see Han die again and this was shown in Tokyo Drift, the third Fast and Furious film, that was released in 2006.So, overall, with FAST SIX or FAST & FURIOUS 6, I both love it and hate it. The movie does a few things right, but the whole idea of kidnapping Mia was a little bit crazy, but this is FAST and FURIOUS, so I'll give credit to the director Justin Lin and writer Chris Morgan for coming up with a great climax. I give it a 7.9 out of 10. It's not the best Fast and the Furious film ever, but it could have been a hell of a lot worse. And I do mean worse, I'm referring to the fourth film, simply titled Fast and Furious, which was released in 2009.",joshuadrake-91275,"Sep 23, 2015"

8,Bizarro World,"Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is officially the new Arnold Schwarzenegger. But more importantly, the person in charge of keeping The Rock bicep-deep in arm butter should get some Executive Producer credits and be deemed the new hardest working man in Hollywood.Under the direction of Justin Lin, ""Fast & Furious 6"" sees the return of almost everyone from ""Fast Five""; including Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner, Dwayne Johnson as Hobbs, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, etc. as they come together for one last job...again. Also joining the crew is Gina Carano as Hobbs' assistant (and my future wife) who is apparently given free rein to go MMA on everyone she sees fit. And returning (because she's got nothing better to do) is Michelle Rodriguez, in a storyline less focused on, the better.Synopsis: Duhhhhhh.Fast cars go fast.Why the movie works: This is clearly Lin's best visual stab at the franchise yet, as he not only creates the best things-blow-up climax to come out of any of these films, but also (for the second time in a row) gives his audiences exactly what they came to see. Lin does a brilliant job of making sure there is either a car driving fast, a woman in a bikini, or the Rock giving someone the people's eyebrow and spouting off something fantastically WWE-ish, on the screen at all times. In fact, he has done so well with guiding this franchise into the realm of highly entertaining B movie fluff, that it is a wonder why he is being replaced by horror director James Wan for the upcoming ""Fast & Furious 7"".Side Note: I realize Lin did direct both ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" and ""Fast & Furious"" as well, but let's be honest, those movies are better left forgotten.Final Thought: Aside from the fact that ""Fast & Furious 6"" is a tad too long, that Vin Diesel still calls what he does acting, that there is an odd body distortion phenomenon which happens when Diesel and The Rock stand next to each other and that the storyline doesn't really matter (especially the more sentimental sections) I'm not ashamed to say that I was thoroughly entertained as I walked out of the theater. And while I realize that this is a lot to look past, if you are the type to spend your hard earned money on a movie entitled ""Fast & Furious 6""; a movie which is filled with unbelievable, yet well constructed, high flying, auto-centric stunts and enough comic relief to get the casual fan through, then this installment is clearly worth watching.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

9,This moment. We Own It.,"At first when I heard the song ""We Own It(Wiz Khalifa ft. 2 Chainz)"" playing at the starting credits of the movie which is a collage of first 5 films, I said to myself, ""I have got my money's worth"". Fast and Furious 6 brings out an ensemble cast along with amazing action.In this movie, Hobbs(Dwayne Johnson) seeks the help of Torreto(Diesel) to catch a criminal named Shaw(Evans) by offering him to reunite him with Letty(Rodriguez) who was presumed dead. Then on its the story how Torreto assesmbles the team and takes on Shaw, along with trying his best efforts to get back Letty. The story doesn't have much to it, but its the action sequences with some nest jaw dropping moments in recent times along with one-liners, keeps you entertained. There are few over the top sequences, but Fast and Furious fans are not gonna mind that.Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, essay their roles with ease. In this part we see a lot of action from Dwayne Johnson and trust me its good. Gina Carano's fights are cool. But its Tyrese Gibson with his funny and loud-mouthed Roman Pearce who wins your hearts and a special mention to Ludicrous who has some witty dialogues.Director Justin Lin shows how genius he is at the end when he connects some missing links. Overalll Fast and Furious 6 is another super 'add-on' to one of the enthralling movie franchisees. Go and sit in the Driver's seat!",sujanfaster,"May 29, 2013"
5,SPOILERS warning,"This movie was a real fun to be if u have not watched the last one hour of the film. from a great surprising plots and great fight and chase scenes the whole thing comes to a halt and seems like we r being made fool at. how can a person jump up from a car moving 80 miles an hour across the bridge , catch a 120 lb lady in air and land on the wind screen of car without getting a single scratch on your face is like having a dream come true utterly nonsense ,stupid and ruined all the charisma and beauty of film.the last 20 minutes were like watching a cartoon movie even that could make some sense . (HAN) you are a lover and and u eat bar b q enjoying the funeral at the end thats why u r punished with at the start of credits .",mudassar_ash,"Jun 19, 2013"
9,One of My favorite Movie,"Will I like this kind of Movie....The Voice and Style of Van Diesel, the Power of Champ(Rock) Outstanding Movie... The F&F 6 I also liked Because the uniqueness in Style like in 6 Series they stole the whole bunch of Money Bank....And the way they carry is WOW... There's love between man and his machine (aka: shiny paint jobs on cars most of us can only afford to download images of); the love of the adrenaline (aka: there goes the neighbourhood, and the city's reconstruction budget); the love of a man with his fellow man.There's also love for the family and the urge to keep it together but most importantly to the antagonist of the movie – the love of money. These last two factors play a big role in Fast 6 (also known as Furious 6). The former of the reasons include the misleadingly deceased Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodrigues), Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel's) former girl- friend, turned amnesiac female muscle of the villains.Letty's actual necessity – as the necessity of any of the parts of the Fast franchise – is questionable. Perhaps it is just as much as the plot device about the villains needing a chip to make a 'Nightshade' contraption capable of blacking out the power of an entire region (seriously? Well we experience the use of same device daily, I guess).This matters not, because for whatever its worth, the Fast movies are beyond unexciting. Mr. Diesel and co. is the reason behind the sale of the tickets; later DVD's; much later the commercials on television. His recent workmates include Dwayne Johnson as Luke Hobbs and Gina Carano as Riley Hicks – aka the anti Letty. Seeing Ms. Carano and Ms. Rodrigues duke it out is one of the giddy delights of Fast 6 (they duke it out twice, so the ticket automatically pays for itself twice at one go). However, there's still more.In keeping with the style here's what you get:Hobbs and Dominic – with their bulging biceps – muscle out frames, trying out plans to knock out the bad guy mercenary (Luke Evans); Brian (Paul Walker), now relegated to a notch-above-extra status, travels back to the US to learn how Letty survived; Roman and Tej (Tyrese Gibson and Chris 'Ludacris' Badges) play with machines; Han and Giesel (Sung Kang, Gal Gadot) provide ancillary window dressing. And of course, let's not forget the usual': mean hot-rods, skimpily clad women and two road- crushing, people-crunching finales – one involving a tank, the other a runaway airplane on a hundred mile runway.Fast 5's climax involved a giant bank vault being through the city, so in keeping with reality is not really a priority here. But by now, you already know that.Starring: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Sung Kang, Gal Gadot, Luke Evans, Gina Carano, and Elsa Pataky.Fancylive.com",ooppssee,"Jun 13, 2013"

1,tired addition to the franchise,"I was actually looking forward to this, right up until the point i actually watched it. I always believed that the object of a film should be to immerse the audience and suspend disbelief, and while the former was possible the latter never happened. Let's leave aside the obvious issue with any law enforcement agency of any type based within the countries known as the ""5 eyes"" requiring a group of retired criminals to work on their behalf. It would never happen. Lets also ignore the obvious problem within the plot regarding surveillance cameras in London, the most ""watched"" city in the world being conveniently ""down for maintenance"". As there are multiple agencies controlling multiple cameras in that country there is no chance that all those agencies would be offline at the same time. ""Brian"" managing to spend less than 24 hours in a California maximum security prison, ""as a favour"", after flying there and back seemingly in a couple of days and securing all the information he needed. Anyone who is even remotely aware of the American justice system would find that laughable. The plane chase along a runway that must have been at least 20 miles long for the amount of time it took the C5 Galaxy/ Illyshin IL76 (take your pick of heavy lift aircraft) to not quite take off, making it the longest non existent runway in the world. Street racing in central London lets ignore the fact that this scene had no reason to be in the film at all for a moment, except as justification for the title. It's Impossible! Flat out impossible with traffic calming measures, and some of the most crowded and narrow streets in the world, not to mention enormous police presence. Let's not even discuss the tank! So a film with a very lose series of sequences, based basically in London, i guess because the film grants went that way, because there is no reason any international criminal on every law enforcement radar in the western world would base himself in that city, dialogue that was so poor and so clichéd that it is worth watching only with the sound turned off, and a plot that has absolutely zero possibility of ever being believable and you have this film in a nutshell. Let's hope they give the next part of the franchise to some adults for script writing, because while the 13 year old's had a ball bringing this one to the screen, it can surely only appeal to those with a similar mindset.

9,Best Fast and Furious to date!!!!,"Freaking AAAAA!!!!! Wow, best Fast and the Furious to date!!!! Everything you need is right here. Drama, love, suspense, action, comedy, non stop thriller. This movie has more twist and turns then most movies in the last 5-years. And that's saying a lot!! It combines the previous Fast and the Furious together.......with the added twist at the very end. Boy, if you guys have doubts about this movie, say no more. This is a must see. Worth the money? Hell yeah and more.All the cast and crew comes back so you won't be disappointed. It leaves off from the last one. The story all flow together extremely well. Familiar faces, familiar foes. I mean, it's huge. The ads and trailers don't this movie justice. You just have to see it to believe it. Past, present, and future. Watch out. Fast and Furious 7 to be continued.",tomlu1,"Jul 7, 2013"
10,Awesome!,"Watched it 4 times already! Fast and furious 6 is equal with fast and furious one (fast 1 would only win because when it came out it was new and cool). The fast and furious franchise has, since number 4, improved dramatically in terms of screenplay, quality of acting, storyline and action sequences!The coming together of the team again together with ""The Rock"" Dwayne Johnson, really brings the chemistry of the team to another level. Watching Brian and Dom work together to run the team works so well, and each team member really brings in a special element that they can add to the team.The return of Letty to the franchise also helps to complete this and is good to see her character return to the story!Fast Cars, Amazing Soundtracks, Awesome Stunts and action sequences, overflowing testosterone and classic one liners really make fast and furious 6 the great movie that it is! 10 out of 10!Make sure you wait until the end of the credits!There's a reason why this movie was number one in the world for two weeks!",mooks88,"Jun 27, 2013"
9,Arguably the best movie in the franchise,"The sixth and latest installment in the Fast and the Furious franchise sees Agent Hobbs ask for the help of Dominic Toretto and his gang help track down a wanted criminal.I have to say that this was the movie I was most looking forward to in the 2013 Summer blockbuster period, and I'm glad to say that I got what I wanted from it.The movie had a lot of exciting action sequences which made it an improvement to the previous movie. Given that a lot of action movies lately have been disappointing mainly because of the lack of action, this is continuing the resurrection of proper action movies following The Expendables movies and The Last Stand. Let's hope this path remains open. Being a UK citizen, I loved the idea of having it set in London and having some of the action scenes take place in London, even though they were actually filmed in Glasgow. It made good use of the London scenery and it was nice to see the fabulous Rita Ora make a cameo. It also had a lot of humour which made it funnier than most bad comedy movies and even some popular ones which in my opinion were overrated (*cough* The Hangover *cough* Ted *cough*). The story-line wasn't exactly good but then again, none of the story- lines in any of the movies in this series are. At the end of the day, it's more style than substance. If I have one criticism to make, it's that one or two of the stunts were unrealistic. But let me put it this way - at least it's not as bad as a lot of really terrible and over-the-top Bollywood movies.I seriously think that this is the movie that should've rounded off the franchise rather than make a seventh movie for next year. All I can hope for now is that without Justin Lin on board, they don't mess it up.",amalank,"May 19, 2013"
2,the most ridiculous final sequence ever,"This movie was too crazy and silly to be any good. First of all, since it is the sixth film in the serious, you already know there is no plot. And then too many absurd things happen. Like Brian returns to LA to go to prison under an assumed name. His cop friend just gets him in a high security prison under a false name and then he meets the guy he was looking for, fends him and his goons off, and the next thing you know he's back on a plane to London. Yeah, sure. But the worst part of course is the ending and the plane. The action here is just too over the top. Cars hanging on a plane, people jumping out of a fast moving plane and landing in a car. Give me a break, they would have been on the runway. Then how long was this runway. And the plane explodes but Dom walks away with not even a tear in his wife beater. And how could Dom not have known to hide his sister, terrible.FINAL VERDICT: Stay far away from this.",MLDinTN,"May 17, 2014"
8,Ride or die... Remember?,"This is not just a sequel, but it's a back to back sequel that goes back to all the five previous films. As we all know, Furious 6 stars the same cast from Fast Five (except Don Omar & Tego Calderon) and adds up new characters in the franchise who are Shaw (Luke Evans), Jah (Joe Taslim), Riley (Gina Carano) and brings back Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who was last seen in Fast & Furious (2009).This is definitely fast and furious if you compare this one to the other films. This is not about street racing. This is not about running away. And this is definitely not about another heist. Chris Morgan has sat down and written a predictable and strong script that drags ''The Fast And The Furious'' franchise more audience. But what we all should not forget is that this film is like a meal that has all types of delicious tastes. It has speed cars, amazing action sequences, sexy ladies, jokes that'll make you laugh for a while and at the end a surprise. Simply said, it's the action packed blockbuster of the year! It's actually pretty cool to see Dominic (Vin Diesel), Brian (Paul Walker) and the rest of the crew take side with Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson). When you leave the theater, it will give you a different, but satisfied feeling. Probably because all the actors in this film have important roles that just turn out to be bigger and bigger for each and every sequel. It's not just about Dom and Brian, but about everyone. Without one of all these characters, Furious 6 would have been a mess. That says how important each and every character is.Furious 6 is not a fun ride like Fast Five, but it is a serious ride. This is not the film you want to miss at the theater. Book the tickets as soon as possible, buy a pop-corn and soda and enjoy this ride. This is way better than what you think/expect.Dear Justin Lin, Thank you for the 4 fantastic films that you've directed in The Fast And The Furious saga. You will definitely be missed in the next film.",dkemathas,"May 24, 2013"
9,More Furious than ever!,"I don't think there has ever been a franchise in which the sixth entry has been it's best. I also don't think there has ever been a franchise where it really started getting good with the fourth. But here it is Furious 6 is one of the most entertaining action films I've ever seen. I won't lie and say that the series isn't a pure unadulterated guilty pleasure but make no mistake there is quality here. Director Justin Lin seems to be a master of orchestrating grand action set pieces, family melodrama thats actually engaging and a group of actors that let's face it are coasting on pure charisma and presence in these films at least. It's also surprising to see a franchise whose numbers have grown critically with each installment reaching an all time high with almost 80% positive on rotten tomatoes. And it's completely deserving. Picking up where the super entertaining Fast Five left off we find out automotive heroes enjoying their riches when Hobbs played by the king of likable himself the Rock tracks down Toretto (Diesel) for help with a very attractive international terrorist played by sexy Luke Evans the twist that was displayed in the last film is played as he tells him that the supposedly dead Letty played by Micelle Rodriguez with fierce sneer is alive and kicking. He of course immediately gathers up the gang and they go after her. What unfolds is a bit ridiculous which should be expected but it's also explosive. From the film's twists to the utter charm oozing off these actors to the one of a kind testosterone fueled adrenaline pumping action sequences this is one hell of a ride. There's even a few big surprises especially towards the end. With this entry they prove the formula isn't a fluke and I look forward to loads of more vehicular carnage for years to come. Gone are odd character moments and insipid car themed dialogue and what's replaced them is something you shouldn't feel guilty about loving cause it's awesome! 4.5/5",rivertam26,"May 27, 2013"

8,Firing on all cylinders!,"I haven't always had a love affair with the F&F series. I thought the first one was pretty dumb, hated the second, and never saw the third. The fourth drew me in - I rented it at some point and found it really entertaining. Then, they brought in The Rock for the fifth, and I knew I had to see it. Justin Lin made a near perfect action movie with Fast Five, including one of the best action movie sequences (as unbelievable as it may be) of all time with the safe steal. That heightened my expectations for Fast & Furious 6.Let's get this out of the way first - this movie has a terrible, terrible script. The dialogue is beyond horrible, to the point of eye rolling, and there are plot holes galore. However, you don't go into a F&F movie expecting to see a great script or natural dialogue - you go in to see over the top action set pieces, fast cars, and butt kicking...and on those notes, it hits on all cylinders.There isn't anything in this movie that tops the stolen safe from Fast Five, but a scene featuring a tank on a freeway comes pretty damn close. The finale is also really intense, but I wish it would have been shot during the day instead of night, because a lot of what's going on is hard to see. I understand it was probably done for editing purposes, but a lot of it was just so confusing during the end. We get to see a lot of classic cars, testosterone, and explosions - overall, it's just a really fun movie, as ridiculous as it may be at points.Don't get out of your seat right after the movie ends. There's a scene at the end that is surprising and amazing.",Jay-Klee,"May 27, 2013"

10,A New Family Adventure,"The fifth part of the famous high-octane saga set the highest bar for the Fast and Furious series. And as for me, this is the last film that somehow clung to realism (until the final chase with the safe). The new picture, already the sixth in a row, takes another height for itself, demonstrating to the audience that the creators, led by director Justin Lin and curator of the project Vin Diesel, are only going to increase the degree of their stories. The new film of the series perfectly shows that the attraction for fans will continue.All the famous participants are returning to the picture, of which almost a dozen are already being recruited. They are joined by new interesting faces. Despite the abundance of heroes, each character is remembered for his charisma, appearance, motivation. There are no passing heroes to be found here. Each of them is well written in history. I would not celebrate the acting of someone specific. It's just not the kind of movie where special emotions prevail. After all, this series has already come to its sixth iteration as a frank semi-fantastic adventure, where many laws of reality simply refuse to work for the sake of plot moves and a beautiful picture. Therefore, ardent lovers of realism are likely to remain dissatisfied, literally refuting this or that action at every step.By the way, about a beautiful picture. She's really cool here. The film is staged from this point of view is amazing. There are a lot of memorable action scenes on the screen, which often replace one another. There will definitely be chases, shootouts, well-staged fights in the film. The directors know their business and understand how best to give the viewer this or that information. They do it competently, moving already to the modern level of action scenes, where we will not shake the camera at every blow or switch the plan to hide a fake fight. Everything is much more realistic here.From the point of view of the script, the picture plays on the relationship of the main characters in the past. Here is the unification of former enemies, and the confrontation of once close people. Pretentious dialogues do not go away, and the development of the plot is sometimes unpredictable. But it is very interesting to watch the confrontation between the two teams.Despite the entertaining accent of the film, the picture is quite capable of evoking warm and deep emotions. Sometimes you try to imagine yourself in the place of the main characters and it turns out to feel how hard it is for them in this or that situation. Although there may be the closest and most devoted people around you, among them you feel like you are in the desert, especially when you realize that the love of your life no longer knows you, and moreover, is fighting against your family.It is worth paying tribute to the whole team. They emphasize that the new world of Dominic Toretto and his friends is not the street racing that they have been fishing for all the past years. Now the stakes are much higher, and the team is up against really dangerous rivals who not only drive cars well, but also have excellent military training and a whole military arsenal to boot. And this pressure on the characters is felt literally in every scene. The chases have become more violent, the price of error has increased many times, and the final fight will be truly fascinating.""Fast and Furious 6"" is a great picture for fans of the genre and a series of films. A competent approach in everything allows you to give the audience a really memorable action movie, where there is a place for everything: cool scenes of chases and fights, drama, good humor. The creators did their best so that we could remember this movie for many years.10 out of 10.",alekspredator87,"Jul 14, 2023"

8,Road to London.,"Fast & Furious 6. Road to London. The saga is moving more and more away from street racing and any other racing into an action movie with tanks, shooting and terrorists, perhaps for the better, who will be interested in watching the sixth film in which there are only races with the same actors. The sixth part itself is even more dynamic and to some extent incredible (those who watched will understand), but this is already becoming even a plus of the franchise, which makes you watch and not pause to leave. The music is still on top and you then add many tracks to your playlist.

The target? A gang of pro hijackers led by ex-Special Ops soldier Owen Shaw (Luke Evans, excellent). The reward? Full pardons for Dom and his crew. The bait?

10,Start Your Engines!,"I watched ""Fast & Furious 6"" earlier yesterday, and I must say that this movie is amazing! I didn't think Lin could top 2011s FAST FIVE but this sixth installment is bigger & better! With extensive, explosive & entertaining action sequences, big laughs & lots of drama - Furious 6 delivers everything you'd expect + more! the pacing is perfect, it's great to see the team working together again, and the story is very intriguing - if you're a fan of the previous movies than this one will mean even more to you.Letty's presence is carefully scripted, and Shaw's ties to a former foe lead the team down some dark paths.. but thankfully they have Hobbs to help clear the way to take down this very dangerous gang.Everything comes full circle, and while it is fulfilling - it's also very dramatic how everything ends. You can never really go home again, it's always a different experience.Lin does a great job of balancing the characters, action pieces & story. Some really unexpected twists throughout - you won't see 'em coming!Make sure you watch(ed) 2009s FAST & FURIOUS & FAST FIVE before this- otherwise you'll be quite confused. And just to clarify - this IS another PREQUEL to Tokyo Drift! I highly recommend this movie to all movie-goers, it's a gem. Congrats to Lin & team!",JamminRon,"May 19, 2013"
9,"High Octane, Action-Packed Sequel!","It's amazing how we are now six films in this lucrative franchise, and each film gets better and better. It truly amazes me what the filmmakers are able to come up with to please the audience and fans of The Fast and the Furious. Fast & Furious 6 continues on the track Fast Five took and it introduces us a bigger, badder villain, the cast reunited one again, a trip to London, and some high-octane action sequences involving a plane and a tank. If you don't think they outdid themselves with stunts from the previous film, you're about to be amazed.Justin Lin's film takes place after the events of Fast Five as the crew have retired after their heist, though they are still wanted. However, Hobbs offers them all full pardons if they help him take down a skilled mercenary named Owen Shaw whose gang of members include the presumed-dead Letty.The acting is really good and everyone has really matured from the first film, so that was a plus to see. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are like brothers and are the faces of the franchise, but they did a very good job once again. Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, and Sung Kang are all welcome members of the crew. Dwayne Johnson comes back and does not hold back as Hobbs. Michelle Rodriguez makes a welcome return, though her acting seems a little fishy. Luke Evans makes a potent villain and is leagues above the villain from the previous movie.Overall, Fast & Furious 6 is an awesome, high-energy, action-packed extravaganza and it will certainly blow your mind away. I liked how they tell more of a story here backed by some realistic dramatic moments. This film is not all about the action, but about being a family. I also like the montage in the beginning as it shows how the characters have changed from Film 1. If the post-credits scene is any indication, I'm definitely looking forward to Fast 7. And finally, R.I.P Paul Walker! I rate this film 9/10.",g-bodyl,"Sep 13, 2014"
1,De gustibus...,"To start with: I'm a film amateur and I appreciate those old fashioned films that nearly no one bears. Given this preamble I have to say I'm really astonished by the votes here on IMDb. I give this film the worst possible vote not since it deserves it but just to push a balanced judgement as it's now on cinema and the actual average is 6,5 (I'd give it a 4-5). The film is a standard B-movie with the standard ingredients of the series. Races, pursuits, and everything authors could think when dealing with cars. Add some nice guys, some nice girls, a bad guy and expect authors to force their minds to find something more engaging than the 5th film finale (I admit it: 5th film final 10 minutes scene was really good from an action film perspective). Everything is predictable. Irony tries to be there but fails. Characters seem to follow a 200y old theater script. This seems to be just the summary of what producers think about the audience of their series: vroom, boom, bang, boobs, lol. Not good at all. I could give it a 6 only if I'd be with no money and I'd need to justify myself after spending my last 10 dollars on this flick. Fortunately I'm not so desperate.",Ladiloque,"May 31, 2013"
10,best movie ever!,this movie is the best ever it is so exciting to watch if u see the trailer then u really feel like watching it because it has a lot of action and brilliant cars the actors are exceptional and the action is very good. i really like the cars in this movie when ever they drive the cars they drive them really fast and thats why i have rated this film 10 out of 10 it is 100% phenomenal the best part about this movie is the actors they are really good. i have never seen so good actors that can drive cars so good. the best thing about there driving is that they know hot to control it when they turn corners they just act like they know there is a car there. Vin diesel is a really good driver in this movie he really knows every police mans move he knows were to turn he even knows the whole place t the back of his hand.,hamza-ali57919,"Jul 12, 2013"
8,Money Or Family?,"In society, you make a lot of decisions, there are right choices and the wrong choices. In this Fast and Furious 6, you'll see a difference between the right choice and the bad choice. If you join the good side, you will end up being a good one, and have a good family. If you choose to go to the bad side, then you will only earn a lot of money, but you'll still lose them at last, and you will die. So, this movie tells us to do good things and to not do the bad things, and if you do good, you will be good, if you do bad, you'll end up bad.",dannychenhh,"Jun 22, 2018"

4,Going Fast made me Furious,"Fast and Furious 6 is the sixth installment in the popular, Fast & Furious franchise. I think Fast 5 is absolutely awesome, but this is just so... DULL. This film has been done before and better. Fast and Furious 6 is just so dumb. It has good cinematography and placement of the camera, but not much else. It definitely chooses style over substance, and that got annoying when you heard this characters speaking every major plot point... BOOOO!This film is just so uninteresting, but it does have some promising visual effects.4 out of 10.",joe-is-sexy,"Jun 25, 2013"
8,Turn Off Your Brain and Enjoy the Ride,"Almost as if some sort of divine intervention took place, this Fast movie is the best in the franchise, combining a lot of high-octane, ridiculous action with a decent plot, bad guy, and the entertaining character interactions of the previous film. Instead of boring us with attempts at story and character this one understands that the Fast series should be popcorn films and assaults us with nonstop action from start to finish. None of the middle slump I complained about in the other movies, this one is paced well.Federal agent Hobbes tasks Dom and the team with one final mission; to take down a world class driver connected to the cartel from Fast and Furious, and who also has Letty driving with him. Since she's supposed to be dead, this interests Dom immensely and leads to a reunion from the previous film. Taking down the bad guys won't be as easy as before and the team races through the streets of London and Spain to stop a super weapon from being placed in the wrong hands.It's a James Bond level plot with Schwarzenegger style action. The focus is not on racing but on driving fast and causing a lot of explosions. It's dumb, that's for sure, but it's also exceptionally fun. The tank scene gets a groan for physics but a hurray for still managing to be kind of awesome. The final scene has the longest runway on the planet combined with the stupidest take down of a cargo plane in film history but it's still cool. Turn off your brain, sit back, and enjoy it. That's all you can do.As a movie it's the most fun of the series, the best as far as action goes, and I have to say it's the most entertained I've been since starting the franchise. A lot of people hate this one because of the focus not being on where the series started but I think it's better this way and the product is a lot more enjoyable. It's not a film for everyone but if you love big, dumb action movies, this one is a true treat.",sn319,"Dec 6, 2014"
10,amazing film,"I saw fast and furious a two years ago with my friend in cinema. it wan amazing film. there are a lot of famous actors in the film ( vin diesel and paul walker...). I thought it was a very exciting film, so try to see it",khader_aboter,"Jan 13, 2019"
8,from here the franchise becomes bigger on the effects,"This is one of those franchise were the whole cast stays in tact from part 3. But this one surely moves on and takes a big step forward. The cars are still an important item but the effects used are becoming bigger and bigger. And the weirdness of it all is that it all works out fine even as you can spot the CGI clearly in some parts. Not only that, guns and fight scene's do enter the franchise too. The most over the top thing must be the scene with the airplane. If you just look at it then it must be a hell of a runway. They drive for minutes over the runway. And once the plane goes in the sky it just takes off again and again. And still you just don't care. It's in fact the acting and all the characters that makes this franchise work. It do has a few surprises and be sure to watch until the end because once the end credits are running you be in for a big thing. And two things make sense, suddenly you will understand Tokyo Drift and you will be looking out for F&F7. Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3,5/5 Comedy 0/5",trashgang,"Jan 20, 2014"

9,Traditional Fast and Furious movie with surprises in it.,"The story line is continued from the previous part. So you will find relations and references to their previous parts. It is satisfactory actually. In here they have added back a few characters, lost a few. And I should say, they are gonna introduce a really special character in their 7th part (I should keep that a secret for now). Totally combined package of guns, blood, bullets, cars, and everything you can imagine in a Vin Diesel + Dwayne Johnson kind movies. And for action, I should say they have really worked hard. Forget critics. If you are in the FastnFurious line, this is a must watch. Also, they have got a tank!!! Worth the buck.",bnitishpai,"May 30, 2013"
10,You Love Cars? Fun? Action?? You have to SEE this movie!!,"After watching the trailer you go to the cinema with some ideas or fears of silly fun. Not at all! This movie is a really really enjoyable fun packed in a superb dose of action. Maybe 10 is a very high note, but thinking on the kind of movie we decide to see, is what it deserves. The movie have a lot of jokes that really work well with the plot. It's hard to get that combination (plot-jokes) work properly but this is one of that rare cases. About the action, the scenes looks very natural maybe some annoying close ups but overall very good job with chasing scenes. Funny, nice twists, nice action scenes, by far the best of the whole series. People was laughing, wowing and clapping. You love cars, action and fun? then you have to see it and enjoy it asap.

Somehow, they continue to seamlessly weave the story lines of all previous f&f's together so that it all comes together with a big aha! Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel (wow!) are both very good in their respective roles. There really is no supporting cast in this movie because everyone carries off their roles like lead actors.

9,This series just keeps getting better,"This is one of those rare occasions when a franchise goes from being okay to being absolutely awesome. 12 years ago, I would have never expected this series to make it this far and not only that, to evolve into what it is today. Furious 6 does not pretend to be anything else but a high octane summer action movie and it does it better than any other movie this year so far.In Furious 6 agent Hobbs request the help of Dominic and his crew to find a dangerous mercenary in exchange for full pardon, but also to find Dominic's believed deceased girlfriend, Letty. This movie almost feels like a testosterone 007 movie. The series takes us to Spain and England. The chase sequences are just amazing, the stuns are great, and the cars, well; it's a Fast and Furious film. The acting it's what it is, but the thematic of family and friendship are believable and heartwarming. The main villain this time around is pretty solid and does feel like a true challenge for the protagonists. This movie was so well made and so fun to watch that after watching the surprise revelation at the ending credits I can't wait to see the next one. Furious 6 has it all, action, comedy, women, and a lot of insane cars. This is what true blockbuster movies are all about. I highly recommended.",nvillesanti,"May 27, 2013"
1,Seriously,"Why is this movie rated higher than Paul Thomas Andersen's The Master or Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. It isn't shocking to see a mindless movie like this gross a lot of money at the box office, since it is 12 year old's that frequent cinemas, but i can't understand why this movie has a 7.4 rating on IMDb where 12 year old's don't own accounts.I liked fast 5 because, so i went to the theater with my friends with bigger expectations and came out highly disappointed. the movie is full of plot holes to begin with. I usually forgive summer movies for this sin but it way to much here. It wasn't as half as funny as the first one. Some of the lines between Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous, who isn't a good actor by the way, aren't amusing. What is worse is that some times other conversations are introduced just so as to bring in a line between these two. It must be the epitome of bad script writing. My 13 year old sister could write better lines. The action sequences are also ludicrous. I know this is a fast and furious movie but the guys here do some stuff here that Spider-Man only dreams of. What is even more insulting is that the critiques aren't all that hard on this movie. I don't know why some summer movies are admonished for minor misdemeanors but this one gets a pass. One critique wrote that the fast and furious movies are getting so good that by the time they get to fast 16 it would be up for best picture. Do you value time and money? Do you have an IQ above 70? Are you older that 12? If your answer is no, then you are in for a treat.",christian-tesfaye,"Jul 24, 2013"

8,Enjoyable and spectacular instalment! 8.,"I must say this is a saga I like. I liked the first installment, hated the two and third movies (awful) and was positively surprised by the next three, in fact, these are the best, specially the sixth. It is not an epic saga, like ""Star wars"", ""Indiana Jones"", ""Mission: impossible"" and ""007"", but it is very enjoyable and worth watching for the action fans like me. Justin Lin managed to revitalize the saga with the fourth part of it after those two piece of rubbish. In fact, the six one fixed in some way the third one (I should say it gives some sense to the third movie at the end). He really knows how to deal with action. It is true the action scenes are inverosimile, but they agree with the movie's tone. The car chases, gunshots and body fights are spectacular and one of the main attraction in the movie. The pace is another strong point. It never made me bored in spite of its more-than-two-hour-duration and poor performances. It begins by introducing the characters and their situation and then, the action begins with many explosions, chases, shots, twists, etc. The sceneography is very nice, the best in the saga: the Canary Islands, London and L.A. The soundtrack is very good and proper, too (listen to the song ""We own it""). The cast is attractive: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, The Rock, Elsa Pataky, Ludicrous, Gina Carano, Luke Evans, Jason Statham... Except the last two, these are not very good as actors, but are very appropriate for this kind of movies and deliver fun (not deep and dramatic) performance. This is not about character development at all, however it is true there is an evolution in the main character's lifes, which is good indeed. Vin Diesel is one of the least expressive actors in Hollywood's history (The Rock acts better even though he is not a real actor but a wrestling factor, unlike Vin). Paul Walker is dull and they should dress him better to take advantage of his beauty. Fortunately, Elsa's character is unimportant and the script contains many jokes. Anyway, in this aspect, this is the best movie in the saga because the cast contains both Jason Statham and Luke Evans. They are evil characters. The first only appears for a few seconds but very intensely. Luke Evans as the main villain plays a very believable and tough role which represents an added value for the movie. In conclusion, the worst in the movie are its lack of originality, rather flat characters and dull performances from many actors. The best thing is that it gives sense to the threequel, the pace, the capacity of entertaining, the cast, the action scenes (specially the first car chase in London), the sceneography (London is the city I visited I like the most), the main villain, Statham's cameo and the cars. I recommend it to the fans of this saga. 8.",manusanchez90,"May 30, 2013"

8,Fast 6,"I'll admit I was always a fan of the Fast and Furious series, but I wasn't a true lover of the series until it was revamped in 2009 with Fast & Furious; from there the series took off and became bigger and better.With that, Fast Six was a great flick don't get me wrong, the action, the story, and the cars were great, but I feel the movie was slightly too long and dragged out. I feel if they stuck to the pace of Fast Five, the film would have been perfectThe Pros: The cars were great! The actors sexy and believable and the action bigger and better than the predecessors.The sets amazing! had this been a straight racing movie, I feel the film would have fallen flat and not been as great.The Cons: The story had potential, it made sense and was definitely obtainable, having said that the story had too much going on that made the film jump around and wasn't cohesive. The action while amazing, was insane and probably would never happen in a real life setting (still was amazing to watch).Regardless of the cons that didn't float my boat, I still loved the movie and it was a pleasure to watch, i'm super stoked for Fast 7, if you want a taste of Fast 7 go watch Fast 6, enjoy a great car action movie and have a good time.",nflores342,"Jun 1, 2013"

8,A blast!,"This movie was a blast! It was an action packed, humor thrilled action film with cool stunts and fights. The way the characters are laid out and used in the film is how Joss Whedon would use his character in a TV series he would make. My Example being Firefly. This is a prequel to a few of the previous films, though I will admit I lost track of the order. However plot and characters and all of those tie ins with the other movies wasn't too much of a concern since I went into this movie to watch an action packed thrill ride that would take some time out of my night, and then help me sleep and dream about fast cars and beautiful women. It's not as good as Fast Five 5, but its just as entertaining.",jayore3,"May 25, 2013"
8,Action Packed,"Lots of action here from start to finish. The story plot I thought was better in fast 5 but Fast 6 doesn't disappoint with it's ambitious action scenes.

Oh yeah...we still got to see some cars and some hot girls with daisy dukes on.THis franchise definitely got better as time went on...a welcome change since usually most movie franchises go down the drain.",jfm358-88-873130,"Jun 8, 2013"
10,Awesome with a charismatic sense of humor!,"Never have I seen an action-adventure film with a little bit of some comedy here and there. This film was just perfect in that sense. The cast was remarkable and pretty amazing, especially Dwayne Johnson, otherwise known as ""The Rock."" Dwayne Johnson is a pretty decent actor in general, so I'm not surprised to hear that this film is one of his best works. Keep it up, Dwayne! You've kept me enthralled all throughout this film.I know everyone has a different preference of movies that they like, but I don't understand who in the world would ever hate on such a perfect movie like this. Sure, not every movie that comes out these days are the best, but I think people need to learn to stop judging a movie if they've seen it for ten or twenty minutes and then proclaim it to be ""awful."" That's just stupid; you have to actually watch the entire film first to know whether if you like it or not. Believe me, I went to the movie theater and watched this film from the very beginning to the very end. It has some hilariously stupid lines, which is what makes it funny, something that will keep you captivated from all the action and adventure going on in it. Just watch this film, people.

I would make one change and that is to return to its roots, Drag racing and a bit less circuit racing. Don't get me wrong I love the movie but Drag racing is just so much more exciting. I was really pleased with the return of Michelle Rodríguez, I love her character. The car selection is great from the Nissan Skyline to the '74 Ford Escort RS2000. The casting is great all my favourite actors and actresses are back and looking good. The fight scenes where very well choreographed and very entertaining. And the way the audience is told about Letty was very well planned out and brilliantly executed.",stefantheron3,"May 27, 2013"
8,A franchise that has over-corrected enough to finally get back on track,"Fast & Furious 6 picks up on our trusted gang of gearhead criminals following the heist they pulled off in Rio de Janeiro that took place in Fast Five. Now, all of Dom Toretto's (Vin Diesel) crew are fugitives, including the retired FBI agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and his wife Mia (Jordana Brewster), Dom's sister with whom he now has a child. The family are now living in Rio de Janeiro off of the $100 million sum of cash they stole and are trying to maintain normalcy into adulthood. One day, the U.S. Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), who previously tried to stop Dom and his gang's efforts to pull off the heist, has discovered potentially revolutionary information on Dom's allegedly deceased girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who was seen alive and taken by a vicious British Special Forces officer named Owen Shaw (Luke Evans).The bottom line is Shaw needs to be taken down and Hobbs knows that Dom, Brian, and Mia, despite being a family, have the skill-set and power to take down Shaw. Hobbs agrees to allow them entry into the United States once again on a citizen status rather than fugitive one, to which they accept. Reassembling their team of Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Han (Sang Kung), and Tej (Ludicrous), the gang looks to take down yet another criminal mastermind no international organization in the world can touch and only a group of skilled racers can infiltrate.Fast Five was a film that bothered me in numerous respects, but mostly because it seemed that it did nothing more than sell out the core principles of what its franchise was founded upon in order to pull in a greater audience. The sad part was, through all the physics-defying flashiness and stunt chases, even the core fanbase of the series fell for its tricks, and the film went on to be declared the best in the franchise by many critics and audiences. Having said all that, going into Fast & Furious 6 knowing that this new gritty, crime-drama style the series has been implementing since Fast & Furious, the fourth installment, was still going to be in effect, I was about as hesitant as ever.I emerge from the film with the confidence in saying that Fast & Furious 6 is the best film in the series since 2 Fast 2 Furious, a film that for all its issues, is still a fine piece of action-comedy during a year where that genre thrived (the underrated Hollywood Homicide, for one, also came out that same year). This is a film that has it both ways: it's a slick and stylish film predicated upon car racing and vehicular muscle and a strong crime-drama that keeps its characters in perspective through all its gritty style.Fast & Furious 6 touches more on pathos than the previous installments; it cuts through the blatant homoerotic relation the male characters have with other male characters and the fetishization of their vehicles to reveal a deep humanity in regards to relationships. Consider when Dom finds out the high possibility his girlfriend he believed to be deceased is now still alive and, despite being incredulously so, she doesn't remember him at all upon seeing him again. These scenes are revealing because, for once, behind all the glitz and glamour of this franchise, these characters, in addition to the audience, can step back and see the individuals behind the wheel as people (the humans crushed in the scene that takes place on a highway, involving a tank going the wrong way and demolishing every car in its path don't get the same luxury of being humanized, but an installment in this series has yet to be perfect). The emotions don't run saccharine-thick, but they are present, and unless you've let the macho physiques of Diesel and Johnson get the best of you throughout the course of this film and the last, you should at least be able to respect the film's intentions and see what it's doing.Then there's the fact that this film, unlike the last three before it, is plain fun. The characters are more unified in this film, working together and asserting their own personalities rather than just ostensibly working off of one another in a contrived manner in Fast Five. The conversational banter between characters here is also, for the first time since 2 Fast 2 Furious, strong in a way that's witty and enjoyable, though not overdone like in the aforementioned film. Finally, the film's slickness and gritty story doesn't become a downbeat array of fistfights and shootouts like in Fast Five. Everything feels, even for a Hollywood action film, delicately handled and even modeled in a way that emphasized slowburn pacing with humans at the core.Fast & Furious 6 still finds itself overwrought in terms of further distancing itself from the downhome realism in the first film to the point where its inclusion is about as minuscule as a spec of dust on one's rearview mirror. Having said that, when it comes to The Fast and the Furious franchise rebranding itself, this is a more assured and capable spectacle that doesn't feel like it's pandering or selling out, but truly embracing the souls many of us have followed for over twelve years now. Director Justin Lin and screenwriter Chris Morgan, who have handled the directing and writing jobs, respectively, for every installment in the franchise since Tokyo Drift, have finally come to the point where they're not only respecting those involved in the projects, but also the audience.Starring: Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Sang Kung, and Luke Evans.

8,My First F&F Film and I Liked It!,"I have not seen a single installment of the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, one of only a few, I am sure. I never got around to watching the first one at all, consequently I never did get to watch the second, nor any of the five. There was very big buzz about the last one ""Fast Five,"" but unfortunately I was not able to catch it. Now, this time, since Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez made the effort to come over to our country and grace this film's Premiere here last week (the first Hollywood premiere in Manila). I made it a point to watch ""F&F 6"", and I'm glad I did.Now I see what the fuss was all about, and why this franchise has lasted this long and still goes strong. The car chase scenes, on which this franchise's fame lay, were amazingly planned, executed, shot and edited. There was that chase scene on the freeway with a tank, ending with a superhuman midair rescue you simply have got to see. As if that is not enough, the entire last sequence was about cars trying to get a Russian cargo plane from taking off, all the while fighting off the enemies mostly mano a mano. I commend director Justin Lin for these ace pieces of action direction.In between these big action sequences, there are the scenes of the team led by Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker) talk about about being a family and never leaving anybody out. Among the members of the gang, Tyrese Gibson stood out as the loquacious Roman, the film's main source of comic relief. His funny one-liners also came fast and furiously hilarious. Matching big and beefy Vin Diesel is big and beefy Dwayne Johnson. The Rock plays a cop, Agent Hobbs, who sought help from Dom's and his team in apprehending another team of mercenary drivers doing terrorist errands led by Owen Shaw (played by Luke Evans). In return for their help, they asked Hobbs to work for their amnesty so they can all go back to the States, instead of hiding in countries without extradition as they are now. The unexpected return of Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who was apparently thought to have been killed in a previous episode but now was working with the enemy, provides dramatic focus for the characters, particularly Dom. Overall this is one very entertaining and exhilarating film, which I understood and appreciated well even if I have not seen any of the previous films. Well, I am sure fans who have seen all the movies will love it even more than I did since they have known and loved all these characters already. The top-notch action sequences left nothing to be desired, really breath-taking. These heart-stopping stunts are all admittedly downright ridiculous and impossible, but that was why they were all so awesome to watch.",3xHCCH,"May 24, 2013"
8,Has good as Fast Five,"Agent Hobbs(Dwayne Johnson) is hot on the trail of a gang of ruthless hijackers led by Shaw(Luke Evans) in London, and this gang is too clever, they always manage to stay two steps ahead of the law. So Hobbs figures you need criminals to catch criminals. So Hobbs ask for Toretto(Vin Diesel) and gang for help, and promises them full pardons if they succeed.The action is incredible, so where the characters, everybody plays off themselves perfectly. Luke Evans is calm, cool, villain. Dwayne Johnson really owns things up in all most every scene he's in. Vin Diesel is entertaining has Toretto. But it's Tyrese Gibson who steals the show has the nitwit of the group. It does have good fight scenes, and the car chase scenes are pretty intense.",DarkVulcan29,"May 27, 2013"
1,Too much incredulous stupidity for me to handle,"I can handle a certain amount of incredulous stupidity in film, if it entertains. But when a movie like FF6 blatantly abuses that limit of incredulous stupidity, I tune out.I only paid to see FF1 and FF2 in theaters. After that, I have only watched the rest of these ridiculous sequels for free on cable TV. I figured that I can handle the stupidity if it is free and it entertains.But the entire time you watch this movie, you will not be entertained. You will be constantly asking yourself ""do the people who make this movie think I'm THAT stupid??""There are ""turn off your brain movies"", and then there's this overblown turd which amplifies the stupidity x100. I won't bother giving a plot review because there is no plot. I won't bother commenting on the acting, because there is none.All I'm saying is this.... If you're going to make a movie to entertain me, don't insult my intelligence this blatantly.",artgutierrez,"Nov 15, 2017"

First of all The Fast and the Furious was never a film with cinematic values so high that it would challenge you or change your mindset. That it did rock some people's world was because of it's awesomeness. I know someone who got into auto tuning because of it. All his well earned money went into his car. Must have driven some parents or wives completely insane.That the Fast and The Furious had impact is a given. But let's get real. It wasn't really an intelligent movie. It was just fun and pure adrenalin. The fourth entry in the franchise for me was a sign that they needed to stop because it was nowhere near fast or furious. The fifth changed my mind and now this latest part rocked my world again. So how come a lot of people seem to be very critical all of a sudden? Exactly what were they expecting? Fast and Furious 6 is a non stop no nonsense high octane blockbuster action movie that delivers! This sixth entry is pure fan service. It has a little of everything from all the parts in the franchise. OK,there is less racing and more brutal and over the top stunts and action. How is that seen as a problem? Isn't that what we expect from a blockbuster? Hell yes! Complaining about plot and character development. Are you kidding? Sorry for getting worked up here. But see I enjoyed this film from beginning till end in such a way that I am actually looking forward to the seventh entry. I was so against any sequel made after the first two but have become a believer. Which is very rare I might add. Are there really no points I am critical about? Sure I have some points. But they aren't huge enough because this film is never pretentious. It knows it is being ridiculous and revels in it. There are many little nods back and forth to the other parts which makes it fun for the fans who have seen every part. It is also one of the few sequels where it is required to have seen previous parts otherwise you will just scratch your head and don't get the jokes (which I assume is a large group of the reviewers who complained about this one). Do yourself a favour don't act like a grandpa or grandma and let go of if a certain event is possible or not. It's a movie not reality. Fast and Furious 6 is a movie that is one of the best action movies in a long time so go watch it.",chrichtonsworld,"Jul 24, 2013"

9,Not Out of Milk Just Yet,"This movie has all the elements going for it than the previous film, much more emotionally involving because it's moral of family really reaching the audience. This flick consists of intense stunts that will stun the audience as well as surprisingly more exciting stunt driving. Humour wise, they solidified Tyrese Gibson as their comedic symbol churning up most of the laughs. The intro credit scene is as always attention grabbing, with a scene after the ending credits to predict another sequel. This franchise still seems fresh due to all the Fast and Furious films not having generic plots, it is not out of originality/milk yet. There are twists that will for sure surprise you and the performances are in no way stale for a pretty dumb action flick. Even though you've seen all the trailers there are still unexpected shocks. The music score is extremely modern and ""hip"" that brings every scene alive, I already have some of the soundtracks in my play list. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson again reassures the public for the 4th time this year that he is a force to be reckoned with action star. With a very epic climax it truly delivers high octane entertainment to all of it's hardcore fans. This is an extremely satisfying pre-summer flick that still has a kick-ass future ahead of it.",DMurill23,"May 24, 2013"

8,As brilliant as the 5th,"Here the brilliant means many things, the pictures, the driving, the pretty girls, the cars, and the friendship.Following the last one of this series, the 6th shows us a new competition which will be the conflict between two professional criminal team rather than our drivers and the police. The plots of the 6th are awesome but also not perfect just like its brothers, however, this kind of movies aim at showing us the dazzled cars and driving skills. There is not a big flaw I can easily find during the whole projecting, maybe it is because I paid most of my attention to the sexy girls, the cars and the extremely cool driving.At least, one thing I am sure is that this kind of film would not step into the academic awards, but it can be popular among the world, can attract plenty of fans following the series year by year. That's it, no need for anything else.For the last point I mentioned at the beginning - friendship, it is the most valuable element in this kind of movie, it's not surprise that the film like this can also teach us something important. It can be a inspiration for those directors struggling in making junk every day. So, just ust think about it dude.",JolinKnight,"Jul 7, 2013"
8,The Godfather,"""The Godfather"" always came to my mind whenever I watched the Fast and the Furious Series. The screenwriters were inspired by The Godfather. The family is very important. The family being together, Many sacrifices made for every member of the family are exposed to the eyes of the audience. I think the biggest lesson in life from this movie is the importance it gives to the family.The action scenes are exquisite, there are always goosebumps while watching people, the excitement of the audience is always at the top.It should not be forgotten that Dwayne Johnson plays his steel-like muscles and role very well.",drmuhammedsamiduru,"Apr 22, 2020"

10,Amazing. (Just a quick review),"Im not going to talk too much about the film and I only have a few words.Amazing!! To start off with, from beginning to end, the film sucks you in and engages you in. The film has a serious enough plot but with the character Roman, the film manages to have its comedy element throughout. Decent story line and a good build up to the final 40 minutes of the film which is all action pretty much. Overall. The performances were great, the action was spectacular. Just a fun film to watch. So my final rating. 5/5 Stars. (10/10)Other FF movie rating's by me. The fast and the furious, 4 and a 1/2 out of 5 stars. 2fast 2furious 3/5 stars. Tokyo drift 3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars. Fast&Furious 4/5 stars. Fast five 5/5 stars.",mariogamer2000,"Jun 14, 2013"
9,Superb ACTION movie!,"Fast and Furious 6 is an exciting action movie in which ACTION is being written in capital letters.Throughout the movie we can enjoy a fast paced movie with an interesting enough story line and even some plot twists.Additionally we can enjoy quite a few scenes which contain great (in my point of view) gags. For example after the fight in the underground of Roman and Han against their (single) opponent or Hobbs line at the entrance to the barbecue (while this line was even improvised by Dwayne Johnson).All this sprinkled with sad elements of main characters dying, which may surprise some viewers of the Fast and Furious series, complete this movie to a much enjoyable piece of its own kind of art.Side note: Obivously some of the action is exaggerated but I rather see that as it's own kind of style in this series / ""universe"".",daniel_roettger,"Mar 24, 2023"
10,thieves,"we recently watched a movie; it's called fast and furious 6. it's an action and adventure film. this film is sixth parts about a team of car thieves from the Toreto's family. In this film the police ask for help to Toreto's family; to catch an international car thieves. The story is very exciting and gripping, but the film has a bad ending, because one of the principal characters that is part of Toreto's family die. the acting is very good. specially Vin diesel and Paul Walker be represented as a families united in all the good and bad things that have the life. this is a classic movie of fast and furious because it has a lot of races and beautiful cars with women.

9,I recommend this movie for viewing,"Forsage 6 also can't help but feel like a transitional film. It's not the landmark film that ""Fast and Furious 5"" was, and it's not as good as ""Fast and Furious 7,"" so it gets a little lost in the crowd. It also has one of the most forgettable climactic battles. Despite how outrageous the plane hijacking looks, on the scale of the ""Fast and Furious"" movies, it's not the best scene. Nevertheless, it's a damn good movie! Owen Shaw is one of the best villains in the series, the scene with the tank on the highway is terrific, and Letty's amnesia storyline is heartfelt. The movie suffers only because while it has a great villain Shaw, great scenes, and a great storyline with Letty's amnesia, the next movie will do it all better, so it doesn't stand out as much in comparison. But it's still a ton of fun and wild creativity unique to ""Fast and Furious.""",yewica-39863,"Jan 19, 2022"

9,All thats promised,"Sometimes trailers are fast and original movie fails to deliver. This time, its not the case. Fast 6 is exactly what it promises to be. Fast, Stylish, Crafty and Intelligent. From the montage video in the title song (We Own It) including important scenes from all the movies (except Tokyo Drift) - the series finally connects Tokyo Drift to Fast 5. The stunt scenes including the tank are one of the best ones I have seen ever. And the emotional side of Vinn Diesel is one of the best. Its sad that they took Han and Gisele out of the equation, since they are one of the coolest people in the movie. This movie is definitely the finest Fast and Furious Movie ever. Loved it. Must Watch.",vish2407,"Jun 30, 2013"
8,Nice Tie in To the other fast and furious movies,"First off let me say i can't in good conscience give this movie a 10 because there is one scene in the movie they could have did a bit better. I will not spoil it for others, go see it and decide for yourself. However, I still give the movie a good review because it met my expectations: Good Action Flick, It gives you more insight on the character Hans and I felt it tied up some of the past fast and furious films together. The other fast and furious films now make more sense as an extended story after watching this latest one. The ending of the movie definitely set the franchise up for more films and I hope they continue to do good on building the storyline. Now to the critics, It is very terrible that i have read some reviews and see some people say i would give the movie a 6 but to balance the reviews that are higher than they should be I'm going to give it a 1. That is the most retarded crap i ever heard and it is those people that are making the review system faulty. Rate the movie based on how you really feel about it. You are not helping anyone make an educated decision on taking a chance to go and see the film. I feel its an eight because they built more on the storyline compared to the past fast and furious films and i also felt there was good chemistry between the actors and I really enjoyed it. Yes the movie has some faults but overall it is an enjoyable film.",icheckcheckers,"Jul 7, 2013"
1,"7,5 rating? This is not good","for the IMDb users community. To give a 7,5 stars to a movie full of clichés, bad acting, kid written plot and a full bucket (or a sea) of flaws is a insult to this community. Except the making of the stunts (the making, not the idea of it) the whole movie is a mess. At one moment you will think that you skipped a part of the movie: not, the script is completely chaotic. But this is democracy: unfortunately everybody can vote. Gosh, Tarkovski's ""Mirror"" got 7.9 stars! I watch this movie with a friend and we laugh like we did it to ""Naked gun"" or ""Hot shots!"" series. And this was a good news for the ""Furious 6"" if it was a parody. But is not. The producers cut ""fast"" from the title keeping ""furious"" hoping that viewers with an IQ lesser than 40 will appreciate the action. Yes, they did it. My rating? 1.",popej27,"Jul 10, 2013"
9,Who needs realism with action like this?,"I didn't expect it, but Furious 6 is by far the best of the Fast and Furious franchise for me. The story was for the most part predictable but believable (the same way Mission Impossible, et al is believable), the characters are so familiar little development is needed, and the acting is passable. But the action in this film has been ramped up so much it's an adrenaline rush 80% of the time.Action in the Fast flicks have always been incredible, but here, it is several notches over that. After the movie, you simply cannot imagine how the stunts are done. All I did most of the time was sit slack-jawed watching all the vehicular action unfold on screen. And this time, there are more than just cars, and much, much more than just car racing.And as is the trend now, the film ends with a teaser for Fast 7. And yet another major action star is set to join the franchise. Can't wait!(5/10 for the story but 11/10 for the action, thus the 8/10 score I gave.)",Mike-DD,"Mar 19, 2014"
8,Got caught up to see what the hype was about...,"Thoroughly enjoyed this film. Totally unbelievable at times, but it's a movie for entertainment purposes. Not a documentary.I had never seen a F&F movie, so I got the DVDs (except for the Tokyo one; heard it was not so hot). I enjoyed 1, 2, 4 and 5 so I was expecting to enjoy 6. Did I ever. I love the fast cars, the sorta over-the-top machismo of the guys and the idea of family. Taking the movies from the racing scene to heists, etc. is an interesting maturing of the franchise. How many race motives can you come up with to stay interesting and relevant? Getting into the heist-action is a good turn, I think. The guys/girls are growing up and it's nice to see some change while keeping in the great fast car scenes. Dwayne Johnson is too much (in a good way) and he seems like more of a caricature of a man. He's just so dang big and ""hulking"" over anyone else. But that just adds to the fun of the movie.The photography is so good - to my eye it's flawless (and I'm always on the lookout for those details about the scene that are missed between ""cut"" and ""action""). The character development is maturing, too, as we get to know these guys through the years. The funny lines are good and some are so small & quick, you might miss 'em.Looking forward to 7 - I love it when you get involved in a movie franchise where you look forward to seeing your ""friends"" again. This is one of those for me.",coastdaze,"Jun 10, 2013"
8,The new movie always tops the previous,"Fast and Furious 6 literally seems to open with the ending given to F&F 5 (with Brian and Dom in a race), it's only at the end of the race that we see the race is not just a competition to see who can get from A to B fastest, but it is to get to Mia as she is going into labor to give birth to Jack O'Conner. The rest of the team is assembled after Agent Luke Hobbs pays a visit to Dom to seek his help in rounding up a team that has been stealing military grade components, a team that has as its member the thought-to-be-dead Letty Ortiz (as teased at the conclusion of F&F 5).",margoduvane,"Jul 24, 2021"

8,Over the top action sequences better seen on the big screen impact lost on the smaller TV,"(2013) Fast And Furious 6
ACTION ADVENTUREThe thin plot about FBI agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) requesting anti-hero group recalled from Domenic (Vin Diesel) to infiltrate sophisticated criminal heist group headed by Shaw (Luke Evans), and assisted by Domenic's old girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez)who was assumed to be dead in exchange for full pardons was only an excuse to showcase one unbelievable action sequence after the next. Some are more over-the-top than others, with amusing one-liners that can be labelled as sarcastic which the audience that I went to watch this with garnered some laughs. What I liked from this installment is that it cuts-to-the-chase starting with the birth of Brian O'Conner's (Paul Walker) first born baby with Domenic's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster)-this is shown in flashbacks as viewers are anticipated to see how clever Shaw and his criminal group fair against Dominic's group who did manage to steal billions of dollars from one of Rio's drug most powerful lords and have him killed in the process from the last installment. In comparison all four ""Fast And Furious"" films directed by Justin Lin I have to say that this film comes to a close second to ""Fast Five"" since they're more over-the-top action sequences than it's predecessor which the only over the top action scene only occurred at that end involving dragging a bank vault. Instead of focusing on trying to top it off, Lin could've showed never before action scenes and the film can still be just as good if not better.",jordondave-28085,"May 16, 2023"

As the final film with Paul Walker, given his unfortunate Career GT crash, the film goes out with a bang, and the tribute in the end will make any grown man cry. It's without a doubt the best film in the trilogy, and certainly the most memorable, giving even the first and fast 5 a run for their money in terms of having a visceral impact on viewers, especially in the final 5 minutes.",aymansurty,"Jul 19, 2021"
10,Fast & Furious 6,"Just when I thought the Fast and Furious franchise hit its peek with Fast Five, they made this. This was exactly what I expected when I watch a Fast and Furious movie, and more. The action in this movie was crazy, the plot was one of the best plots they have had, and it had a Credit Scene that lead directly into Furious 7. This movie had two final battles. The first one involved a tank on a bridge, and the second involved a battle in a huge plane on an unrealistically long runway. Both sequences were amazing, some of the best in the franchise. I won't spoil any of it, I will just let you enjoy. The plot of the main crew needing to take down a crew of international criminals I though was cool, especially since one of those criminals was Letty. That led to this movie tying into another movie like no other movie has, that movie being Fast and Furious 4. We got an explanation to what actually happened to Letty instead of her dying, and we found out that Braga's cartel was working for Owen Shaw, this movie's villain the whole time. I also love the character of Owen Shaw, he is truly a evil mastermind. Lastly, the Credit Scene in this movie leads directly into Furious 7, I won't say anything, but the scene takes place in Tokyo.This was an amazing movie if you are looking to watch an action packed movie, and I recommend this to anyone who wants to do so. Based on the Credit Scene, Furious 7 should be crazy, maybe even better that this one.",kaden_lewis,"Jul 5, 2021"

8,"Still Fast, Still Furious, Still Entertaining","Fast and Furious has become the most awkwardly successful franchise in the history of film, and the sixth installment just adds to the insanity. Since when does a Part 6 to ANY film find any success or quality? This is an underrated first in cinematic history (Star Wars: Return of the Jedi does not count) as this testosterone-laden monolith of an action flick delivers the women, cars, action, comedy, and themes of family that has become a staple to the franchise since its subtle revival in Fast and Furious.If you have enjoyed this new direction of the Fast/Furious series then there will be nothing here that will disappoint you, from the stunts to the direction to the manly cast that makes the male viewers watching this look like Steve Urkel. The plot is a simple stop-that-man tale that involves the entire cast from Fast Five as well as a couple familiar faces from previous installments, which explains the opening sequence playing out like a flashback. The rest of the movie plays out like an extremely expensive music video with likable characters and high octane action sequences attached.What keeps the motors of this movie (and franchise overall) running is the very likable cast of characters and the connection they've developed with the dedicated fanbase. Even though certain characters like Brian and Mia (Paul Walker shines but is limited) have taken less screen time and we have more focus on Dom and Luke (Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson), they each have their moments to shine and get the audience excited. The writing doesn't totally excel but it goes straight to the point of the conflict at hand and what is at stake.But the cars and what happens to them is the heart and soul of Fast 6. Justin Lin is improving as an action director as he delivers the sequences with precise camera movement, surprisingly crisp cinematography, and enough space so that you can see the sheer scale of the mayhem occurring. While Fast Five still has the ultimate action sequence in the past half-decade, the latter action scenes will leave you breathless guaranteed.This is a very you-get-what-you-paid for film, as it doesn't quite take the franchise to the next level, but maintains delivering what you've come to expect out of these films. The beautiful women will be here, as well as the buff men, the tough-as-nails action, the beautiful cars, the good soundtrack, and a pace that matches that of a car---once the engines are running it truly takes off. While there is no evolution, there is plenty of entertainment to go around for everybody willing to watch.And do stay tuned for the credits. Just when you think that eventual next installment might be overkill, you will leave the theater excited.",diac228,"May 24, 2013"
10,Fast and Furious 6: A Thrilling Ride with Heart,"Fast and Furious 6, directed by Justin Lin, is the sixth installment in the beloved franchise.

However, their tranquility is short-lived, as they are soon approached by Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), who needs their help in taking down a ruthless mercenary, Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). Shaw's team is using high-tech gadgets to pull off daring heists, and Hobbs believes that Toretto's crew is the only one capableFast and Furious 6 is all about the action, and the film delivers in spades. From the opening scene, which features a heart-stopping tank chase, to the climactic finale, which takes place on a massive runway, the film is packed with thrilling set pieces. The action is fast-paced and frenetic, with a focus on practical stunts that add to the film's visceral impact.The cast of Fast and Furious 6 is one of its strongest assets. Vin Diesel brings his signature gravelly charm to the role of Dominic Toretto, while Dwayne Johnson is, as always, a force to be reckoned with as Luke Hobbs.

5,Fast & Furious 6- A Consistent and Idiotic Continuation of the Franchise that Boasts Typical Adrenaline Infused Action and Stodgy Dialogue,"A key aspect in achieving success in the entertainment industry, at least in terms of obtaining a dedicated audience following, is keeping a strong sense of what defines your product's particular genre or style and confidently presenting its strengths in full force but also accepting the weaknesses presented in self-aware jest. Ever since director Justin Lin took over the Fast and Furious franchise the series has taken the route of self-aware confidence where it has embraced its strengths for nonsensical, physics defying action as well as the weakness for having leaden dialogue coming from expressionless characters and fans have been thankful for the consistency. Fast Five might have been the franchise's peak because of its tongue and cheek attitude towards its Looney Tunes environment of unrestrained adrenaline and exaggerated stunts making it difficult for any continuing sequel to match it unless the creators upgraded the storytelling parts of this clumsily custom built machine. The latest in the Fast & Furious series, eloquently named Fast & Furious 6, remains consistent to fan expectations with its fondness for stunt driven spectacle yet it exists in a plot that thinks it's far superior than it is in reality, showcasing screenwriter Chris Morgan's wrongful assumption that more dramatic breathing room between implausible action sequences gives your writing more credibility. There is an existential quandary that lives within Fast & Furious 6 as an attempt at seriousness, either in the renewed relationships or predictable plot twists, in an environment of ridiculousness practically derails this speeding vehicle from its intention on being unadulterated fun. On face and in execution the Fast & Furious films are reminiscent of experiencing a live action version of an anime cartoon (a point of view a friend of mine has reinforced) with its cartoonish embellishment of its physical environment but with far dumber plot lines and exceedingly bland dialogue so when there's less of the latter it's for the better. As guilty pleasures go there are few as technically executed as the Fast & Furious franchise and though the sixth installment showcases some of the series dumbest dialogue exchanges through purely rigid performances it remains a consistent entertainment outlet for those who have been initially conned by the fast and furious appeal.Read more: http://wp.me/py8op-yG; more reviews: generationfilm.net",generationfilm,"May 25, 2013"
8,Pure entertainment. Faster and Furiouser,"¨You don't turn your back on family, even when they do.¨Fast and Furious 6 and The Hangover Part 3 were both released today in what looks to be a tight box office race for the Memorial Day weekend. If you would have asked me a couple of years ago which film I would prefer to see, I would have definitely chosen to go see The Hangover Part 3 because I loved the first movie and thought it was a great comedy; I also enjoyed The Fast and The Furious film but wasn't too pleased with the following three sequels. Then in 2011 when both Fast Five and The Hangover Part 2 came out, things completely changed for me. I was hooked with The Fast and Furious franchise while part two of The Hangover was a major letdown. That is why this weekend I decided to go for Fast and Furious 6 without a doubt, and I wasn't disappointed. This might not be as good as the last film (which I think is the best in the franchise), but it lived up to expectations and was highly entertaining. This is Justin Lin's fourth time in the director's chair in this franchise and he seems to have had a great effect on these movies converting them into entertaining thrillers with some great action scenes. Screenwriter, Chris Morgan, is also back for the fourth time and he has managed to actually put some brains to these fast car races and create better characters. He's developed these characters very well and made them interesting, and has also done a decent job at creating some memorable villains. The film is fast paced, has several thrills, great car chases, and some decent character development. Of course there are several flaws as well: unbelievable and laughable scenes involving guys jumping off moving vehicles and landing safely all the time, and some very predictable moments and foreseeable twists. I still had a fun time with this film and laughed more than I thought I would. If you thought that Toretto (Vin Diesel) and O'Conner (Paul Walker) were retired after their latest heist in Rio, then you were wrong because Detective Hobbs (Dwayne ¨The Rock¨ Johnson) has an interesting proposition for them. He is pursuing some dangerous criminal mercenary drivers led by Shaw (Luke Evans) who have been creating chaos all over Europe. In order to stop them, Hobbs knows that he will need the help of Toretto. Hobbs discovers that Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Toretto's former love interest, is alive and working for Shaw, and therefore convinces Toretto to help him. The rest of his crew decides to come out of retirement as well and try to bring Letty back home with them. In exchange, Hobbs promises these men full pardon, and they accept without hesitation because they are tired of running and not being able to return home. Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Chris ¨Ludicrous¨ Bridges), Han (Sung Kang), and Gisele (Gal Gadot) are all back in order to help Toretto and O'Conner to stop the ruthless criminals pursuing them from London to Spain, but Shaw and his men seem to be always a step ahead of them. This sixth film in the franchise seems to tie some loose ends from the third and fourth installment in a very thrilling and entertaining way. The franchise has really picked up and it seems to have a lot of life left in it. It even ends with a cliffhanger, so it is certain that the seventh film will be coming out soon as well. Most everyone in the franchise is back again (only missing Tego Calderon and Don Omar) and the interaction between these characters is very entertaining. Ludicrous and Tyrese pretty much steal all the laughs in the scenes they are together in, while Gadot and Kang bring in the romantic touch. Toretto and O'Conner have put aside their differences from the first films and their bond is pretty strong now as they are family. Despite some of the insane and absurd action scenes, this film stands above most other action films thanks to a strong performance from the cast. This film is really a lot of fun as long as you don't think too hard of all the physical impossibilities of what they are achieving. The franchise just continues to grow faster and faster, and it works really well for a summer blockbuster movie. Fans won't be disappointed, it is a very satisfying film. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",estebangonzalez10,"May 24, 2013"

8,"The Series Remains Both Action Packed and Entertaining,","Fast and Furious 6 is a brilliant movie with a really well thought out and developed storyline and like the other movies,a very inspired cast.I didn't like it as much as Fast and Furious 5,but it is my second favourite in the franchise,after six movies their still going strong and are only improving with the cast and story.Dwayne Johnson is fantastic in this movie and I think he is one of the biggest reasons this one and the fifth are so great,he plays an even bigger role in this one and joins Dominic,Brian and the rest of the gang.The ending was probably the best part,I won't spoil it for anyone but it gave great potential for what will probably be a great seventh Fast and Furious,and for as long as Vin Diesel,Paul Walker and the rest of the cast agree to do them,i'll want to see more.Fans of the other Fast and Furious movies will be very pleased.Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) gets the help from Dominic (Vin Diesel) and Brian's (Paul Walker) crew to help track down a man who commands in several countries.",lesleyharris30,"Aug 12, 2013"

10,All eyes lead to this!,"More than a decade has passed since the first ""Fast & Furious"", still like all series this one calls for whistles, applause and OMG moments.Now, the movie sort of takes start from where it let off in the last flick. But the comparison ends then and there, this is a whole new thing.Kudos to Justin Lin for making such a fantastic movie with an amazing star cast and not to forget the beautiful yet brawny CARS. This movie is much more than an eardrum tearing acceleration sounds or big muscled people delivering punchy dialogues, this movie is more emotional yet full of action. If you thought Fast & Furious 4 was emotional, you need to see this one. All actors did their job wonderfully as expected.This is definitely one flick you should watch if you are a Fast & Furious series fan and if you are not then give it a try, you are bound to watch all of the series then. Brilliant flick, just plain brilliant.And at last there are two things worth mentioning that would increase your appetite for this movie:- (i) The scene where Dom save Letty's life is breathtaking. (ii) Do not leave your seat when the movie ends, this too like the last one has a BIG surprise.Enjoy the torque!!",siddharthkrishnadwivedi,"May 26, 2013"
8,Very fast and very furious,"Despite abandoning the street racing aspect and going full-on action, this film makes the most of the new style. I can't name my favourite action scene because there were so many. The return of Letty allows for a strong ""family"" dynamic again.",briancham1994,"Jun 1, 2020"
8,"I wanted to hate the movie, but I've enjoyed it quite a bit","There have been interesting Furious films, there have been really bad ones and there have been good ones. The sixth part of the franchise is immensely ambitious in terms of special effects and body count, it features all the actors in the previous films, cool machines, scary villain (British, of course) and, against my better judgement, was fun! So in terms of car chase films, it was one of the better ones.This doesn't mean it was perfect. High speed chases through London, tanks killing tens of people by driving over cars, the damn American movie arithmetic that counts a victory the saving of a main character over a lesser one and the huge amount of physical violence that has to not show blood in order to be OK... all of these made me cringe at times. Also some one liners, but that was to be expected.So it is a viewer choice if the movie is good or not. Mainly it is a gang fight between ""professional criminals"", only some are uselessly cruel while the others are ""family"". I am not going to even go into tribal irony here, but you know what I mean.Bottom line: rated it above average for a movie of its kind. The music was not memorable in any way, as in other films. The chases were flamboyant, but not really focused on driver skill except a few of them. Simple, high budget movie, lacking substance, but fun.",siderite,"Jul 5, 2013"

9,incredible action scenes,"""Furious 6"" is in my opinion a film too much hated and underestimated of this saga. In this film the action scenes are spectacular, absolutely not at the level of the fifth film, but of excellent quality. In this film you can see the sharp change of the franchise, going from the crime of the characters to being heroes: I think it succeeded very well. They made the right choice not to make the actual heroes after a personal choice but with a choice linked to the well-being of the family. It is also clear that in recent films the protagonist is no longer Brian but is Toretto, making the saga much worse, which in my opinion is just right to give some news but.... I love Brian too much. The plot of the film entertained me and interested me, but not as much as the other films, it seemed a little too long, in my opinion it could be shortened a little bit. This film reports Letty, that after the now decreed ""fake death"" in the fourth chapter of the franchise returns giving a chance to Dominic. I understood this choice very well: Dom would never have returned to his previous life without a shocking family news. I hope, however, that they do not remake it with other characters because otherwise it would become too much science fiction, too many dead-resurrected. I liked the new characters and their in-depth introductions, and Shaw seemed like a pretty motivated antagonist. The actors confirm themselves to be very good. The soundtracks are incredible and I think it also improves photography here. I really enjoyed the final scene of the airport, beautifully organized with perfect soundtracks. The setting of the film is excellently chosen as well as the costumes and cars used are gorgeous. I think that this sixth film of the franchise is too undervalued, in my opinion definitely at the level of previous..

5,Fast & Spurious,"Why 5? Because they threw enough money at it to make it resemble entertainment.Basically this film is about a group of immortal rich people who drive fast cars wherever and whenever they want, regardless of consequences.There are only three ways that any of these immortals can die: a) Failure to act cool regardless of the scenario b) Deliver a line in a natural and unforced manner c) To pretend that their not immortal after all, in the false hope that it gives them some depthTo round off the irrationality of this film, I'll pose a question.

8,Casey's Movie Mania: FAST & FURIOUS 6 (2013),"While it doesn't quite reaches the dizzying height of FAST FIVE in term of action sequences, FAST & FURIOUS 6 is surprisingly more fun and more entertaining than the previous five movies have come before.Just how far one can go with a franchise like THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS that originally centered on illegal street racing? In 2011, director Justin Lin and screenwriter Chris Morgan are smart enough to revitalize the series in FAST FIVE by tweaking the formula with a heist-movie undertone. Now, in this sixth installment, Lin and his company has upped their ante by turning FAST & FURIOUS 6 into a MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE-like international intrigue filled with vehicular mayhem. It's hugely ridiculous, alright but FAST & FURIOUS 6 has no doubt exceeded my expectation for being the best movie in the series I've ever seen so far.Chris Morgan's script has considerably improved this time around. All the returning cast shows more colors and winning chemistry and the jokes are funnier (especially involving Tyrese Gibson and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges). While Justin Lin can't really matches the height of FAST FIVE's action scenes, they still delivers nonetheless with each set-pieces are outrageously silly but hugely entertaining than the last.Better or improved as it may be, there are still rough patches within Chris Morgan's sometimes long-winded script -- particularly involving the convoluted revelation of Letty's back-from-the-death scenario. At times, Justin Lin tends to get overwhelmed with his hyper-kinetic direction. Some of the action scenes -- particularly hand-to-hand combat -- are mostly shot in rapid zooms and tight angles. Even the first two chase sequences during the night are sometimes hard to decipher what is really happening.Despite some of its flaws, FAST & FURIOUS 6 remains a solid action-movie blockbuster that both fans and action fans will find this a true crowd-pleaser. Likewise, don't leave the cinema yet once the credits roll. There is a mid-credit teaser that ties back the event of 2006's THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT and a revelation of a certain iconic actor who will be appeared in next July's FAST & FURIOUS 7 (which will be directed by SAW helmer James Wan).",caseymoviemania,"May 24, 2013"
9,Even better than Fast 5! Didn't think that was possible!,"Between exiting the cinema after watching the enthralling fifth entry of this fender-bending franchise and entering to watch the latest installment, most viewers would have asked an important question: has the series reached its zenith? Suffice to say, the answer to any such query is a resounding no!Fast & Furious 6, unabashedly and unreservedly, is the best iteration of the series yet. Like its predecessor, the film follows soon after events that took place in Rio de Janeiro. The crew is all displaced in non- extradition safe havens. However, after hunting the team for the length of Fast Five, DSS Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) enlists their help. The crew must apprehend a skilled group of mercenaries, led by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), in exchange for full pardons. Undertaking the mission would also allow Dom the chance to reunite with Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who has resurfaced and is now aiding and abetting Shaw.Helming his fourth consecutive entry of the series, director Justin Lin has gone from strength to strength. Lin has ameliorated as an orchestrator with the progression of each film since he joined the venture with Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. Fast 6 is grander in both scope and scale compared to its precursor. Simply put, Lin has crafted a machine running at optimal efficiency.Moreover, Lin has at his disposal an impressive ensemble, each given their moment to shine. Vin Diesel portrays Dom with ease, while Tyrese Gibson, who plays Roman Pearce, is also prominent, providing a welcome comedic element to proceedings. The banter and camaraderie shared by the characters in general is evident throughout. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, now a bona fide action star, impresses yet again with his charismatic screen presence. While Fast 6 is essentially another testosterone fueled caper, the females are also part of the action, whether it includes a physical confrontation or getting behind the wheel.Furthermore, Lin employs creativity and variety in a number of breathtaking action sequences. The flamboyant exhibition of mayhem includes vehicles such as cars, tanks and even an aircraft. The hexad episode in the series also contains exquisite cinematography. Similar to his fascination with the landscape of Rio in part five, Lin captures the vibrancy of London. The movie also benefits from a cohesive screenplay, enabling Lin to delve straight into the action, since establishing characters in unwarranted. In addition, the editing of the film is also top notch.Last but not least, Fast 6 also ties up loose ends in the franchise, such as a significant link with the anachronistic Tokyo Drift, which may have been perceived as a spin off until now. The significance of family is an underlying theme throughout the film and Lin manages to create an emotional bond with the characters as well. Fast Five may have raised the bar, setting high expectations for the future of the franchise, but Fast & Furious 6 is able to exceed those expectations emphatically. The aforementioned cast and crew ensure there are no signs of franchise fatigue. While sequels predominantly experience a decline in quality, Fast 6 proves to be an exception, perhaps similar to the Harry Potter series in its progression. All in all, Fast & Furious 6 proves that the series is operating at full throttle in the fast lane, with plenty of gas still left in the tank.",mynameisibrahim,"Jun 29, 2013"

8,Still going strong,"The movie is silly! The action is ridiculous! But you'll either love it or hate it. And if by now you're not sure which side you're on ... It's especially funny for me, because I'm not even into cars! But the movie and the characters we learned to love (yes even Paul Walkers ex-cop turned many other things) are there. And judging by the general vote here on IMDb, this might easily be one of the highest rated sequels and surely the highest rated entry number 6! There are a few things that even the fun part of the movie can't disguise. One of them being the relationship between Diesels character and the woman he's with. It's too convenient, not that anyone would start asking about things like that. There is also a love scene in the trailer of the movie that did not make it into the final theatrical version of the movie. It seemed too sexy anyways for a PG-13 movie.There is also a time-line thing that you have to be aware of. It's a bit complicated I guess, so while you don't have to have watched the other movies, some of them will make more sense (I think), after watching this. Especially the last one Michelle Rodriguez did (not Fast 5!). Although don't try to understand what happened there and how it's possible or anyone would think that ... well again, try not to over-think it! It's supposed to be fun! As are the action scenes!

8,"""Slow & Laborious""","Expectations were high after the inexplicably positive reaction to Fast Five. That film, was completely over the top and thoroughly cool. It seemed as though the Fast franchise was on the precipice of becoming the perfect example of straight-up popcorn cinema; unabashed, silly, and awesome. The ads for Furious 6 gave the impression we were gonna be taken to yet another level this time, (did they frickin' crash a plane with a harpoon!!?) Things were about to get even more insaner-er, i mean we talking' VE-hicular warfare. What's left to say?Unfortunately, Fast 6 is not even awesome for what it is. Yes we get a couple pretty sweet moments here and again; the highway-tank battle being the prime example. But who would've thought the sludge weighing a movie like this down would be too...much....talking. I'm serious, there's about 35 minutes of setup which covers precisely the same material the trailer compressed into about 25 seconds. This is not good for a movie like this. But this wouldn't even be much of a problem if all those interaction/""character development"" scenes were remotely interesting...or good. They are not. The first half is snore inducing, and the characters are not only unlikable, but shallow...no, I mean like even for this kind of film. A good example of this is the movie introduces another hotshot, car-driving crew, and one of the characters has to outright spell out how they are the evil dopplegangers of our favorite nice, team of criminals. The other crew of characters, even for the one-dimensional stereotypes they are, are somehow flat. There's literally not one memorable thing about any one of them.Another issue the movie struggles with is focus. We've got Toretto with his whole ""get Letty back"" plot line, we've got the Rock doing his thing, and then there's this whole subplot with Paul Walker's cop past coming back for him in prison as he's ambushed by some dudes he put away, all of which could've been an entirely separate movie. The film jumps and cuts back and forth between so many different ideas, it loses all sense of direction. And the one- liners...OMG! Suffice to say, the one-liners on the trailer are the absolute best the film has. As I said, there's a couple amusing set-piece moments, but hardly enough to offset the dullness and trudgy pace.Undemanding viewers may derive some pleasure out of Fast and Furious 6 on a completely brainless, intentionally dumb and juvenile level. But Fast Five showed us we can do better.6.0/10",danamadeus,"Jul 4, 2013"

9,In Response to carl-walster's Review,"I composed this originally in response to carl-walster's review of the movie. But I figured, since I've written much, I might as well post it for others to read.I'd like to comment on your review of the movie Furious 6. I really enjoyed the film so I would to give you reasons for your ""whys"".Riley fought Letty even if nobody else was looking so that if ever she successfully captured the latter, Hobbs would trust her more (remember that Hobbs and Riley just met at the start of the movie). Besides, Letty couldn't have known that Riley was working for Shaw. And about Shaw sending Riley ""to her death"", he didn't specifically send her to chase after Letty. It just happened that Riley went after Letty. Besides, Shaw was portrayed as someone who didn't care about his team personally.About your doubt about Dom's car going at high speed then drove into the plane without shooting forward, the TV series Mythbusters had proved that the physics of that scene was accurate. If you think about it, the plane was also moving so the momentum of the car (a term you mentioned in your review) did not actually diminish in an instant; it was still moving when in got to the plane (from the perspective of someone outside the plane).Then about the part where people were crushed by the tank and no one seemed fazed by it, it was not shown in the film (for obvious reasons) but surely ambulances came afterwards.I do agree though that the Military should have involved themselves in some of the situations but still there are lots of reasons I can make up why they were not there.Notwithstanding my disagreement with you, I also don't understand why Hobbs let Shaw get away when they have him to trade for Mia. He did not know she was going to be in the getaway plane. There would be no point in chasing Shaw again and capturing him if Mia was not there.However, movies should be rated, first and foremost, on their entertainment value and not for the logic behind the scenes. And I was very much entertained by the movie. It did not deserve a 5/10 rating.",arsiniryan,"May 26, 2013"

3,"Brainless action with colorful cars, tanks and planes...","I see lots of people here defending this ""masterpiece"" with the claim that action movie needs only great action. Plot, acting and everything else is just irrelevant. ""It's not a documentary."" I read in numerous reviews...To those people I can just say to be careful what they wish. And I wonder why they bother with movies? Why not just watch Wrestling, NASCAR and cartoons? Mix that, ad few explosions, and you have Furious 6...This is a B movie that won a Jackpot and spend it all on visual effects. And underneath the sparkles it is still B movie with B movie actors, B movie script and shiny, but completely unbelievable action.Acting is wooden and most actors deliver their lines like they don't believe whats coming out of their mouths. Script is full of plot holes, plain stupidity and attacks on logic. Action scenes are just plain old fist-fighting and marshal arts bore, or elaborate stunts involving various forms of vehicles at high speeds and no considerations for laws of physics at all...I believe it's possible to make action movies that are not insulting viewers intelligence.

8,Anglo Precision or Latin Love for Family,"Well Toretto went for the right thing as far as I am concerned. Those black pants with the white design were worth the fight!! I couldn't help noticing all those Land Rovers travelling at break neck speeds. Way back when I purchased a surplus British Land Rover Series IIA. With Fairey Hubs/Overdrive the best you could ever do was about 50MPH. But I guess with a V8 engine you can really push it now. Despite all the pyrotechnics, I think the storyline was quite believable and the actors were well chosen. Michelle Rodriguez is striking not so much for the tough fight scenes but more so for a moral toughness. I bet she is like that in real life. The other characters were well played and fit their roles. Even though intellectually you know that the scenes can't possibly be real, your body believes it. The tank and huge aircraft scenes were scary beyond belief. I can't figure out what type of tank that was, sort of a cross between a Chieftain & AMX.",clarkj-565-161336,"May 24, 2013"

2,America saves the World..... again.,"Obviously the target audience of these films (13 to 17 year olds) have never driven a car, never mind one of those mysterious ""stick shifts""..... Anyway, this film has every cliche known to man..... cool black guys, muscle bound American meat heads, hot pant wearing bimbos and evil Brits (The British are always evil, right?).I suggest you watch this film, just in case you've watched too many good films recently. It will allow you to recalibrate your brain to realise what is wonderful, and what is (sorry) complete dross.I'm going to to drive my (stick-shift) car soon and find out if it just goes faster and faster every time I change up a gear and try and make that clunky rifle-bolt sound every time I press the clutch.",g-pala,"Jan 26, 2021"

9,Fantastic,"This was one of the most action-packed movies I've ever seen. And no, I'm not an adolescent.Those reviewers who complained about the contrivances or plot-holes, apparently didn't get the point. In this kind of sub-genre, you have to be willing to sit back with your popcorn and allow some inconsistencies or fallacies. The action makes up for it more than enough. The acting was decent; and aside from the moderate cheesiness, which was actually less than in certain James Bond flicks, I couldn't see anything to complain about. In my opinion this film deserves its high rating and is worthy of a second watch. It's one of the very few movies which I've ever rated 9/10. To say it once more: the action was fantastic, breathtaking, exhilarating and really fun!",joseph45-732-714081,"Jul 8, 2013"
4,WAY too much Letty,"I think the true enjoyment of Fast & Furious 6 depends on an emotional investment with the characters that I just don't have, even after watching all of the previous movies. The story was convoluted, the acting was wooden and the car chases felt lackluster. I can see why others may like it, but I didn't. Although that could just be because this film featured WAY too much Letty. Who knows?",cricketbat,"Dec 28, 2018"

2,So stupid movie,"I really liked the previous Fast and Furious, Fast 5. Some of the previous ones weren't that good but because the last one was so good I really had high hopes. And oh boy was I disappointed. Action was stupid and boring. Plot was even for an action movie stupid and mindless.The ending was just so stupid and I think every person with a brain was already thinking that how long can it be. Action can be unrealistic but if its also boring then you are doing something horrible wrong. I am glad that Justin Lin doesn't direct these anymore, he has lost it.Anyway it was a real shame that this was the last Fast and Furious where Paul Walker was with. Fast 5 was great. This is horrible.",antti-eskelinen-329-929792,"Dec 9, 2013"
8,Impressive action sequences,"The follow up sequel to the critically acclaimed Fast Five, sees Fast & Furious 6 in someway of a different light.Although not as polished or fresh as Fast Five, this film still delivers on great action sequences, a solid plot, and enough light hearted and comical moments for an enjoyable watch.The main plot regarding Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) being brought back from the dead and her supposedly having amnesia of some sorts was a clever twist. We kept watching to see just how real and legit it was.This film also expands more on the characters and more on Brian (Paul Walker) and Mia (Jordana Brewster) with their family dynamics.Dwayne Johnson remains impressive as Hobbs, however feels less utilized due to lead villain in Owen Shaw (Luke Evans- a rather generic and boring villain). We are glad that his appearance was only in this film as the conclusion here clears him off.Overall the climax and action sequences including the main tank scene then the finale with the plane high jacking are thrilling enough that it carries the film.Although not on the overall level of its predecessor (Fast Five), Furious 6 still is a great and enjoyable watch. As a rewatch 05 19 24 opinions remain same. Not on the same level as Fast 7 but still nonetheless entertaining.",Floated2,"Apr 12, 2023"

The story-line was good, written very well, acting was superb (as always), and the action almost made me pee in my pants. It's worth seeing again and then buying the DVD for your own personal movie library when it comes out for purchase. Even with the enormously long unending runway which, for me, slightly diminished the realism of the story, I still enjoyed the movie greatly. The stunts and photography was beyond excellent, and if you've never been much of a fan of Fast & Furious, this one will turn you into one!

9,Real F&F fans will be just as entertained as by the previous movies.,"Fast and Furious 6 is the 6th movie of the successful series by Justin Lin. With a budget of 160 Mio. US Dollars, it came into theaters in 5/2013 - together with the franchise-typical load of women, fast cars and spectacular visuals. The storyline is full of twists, role conflicts and car chases. These are the reasons why the F&F audience is amazed since 2001. Dwayne Johnson, Paul Walker and Vin Diesel fulfill the broad spectrum of the F&F viewers' expectations. But is it as good as expected? Fast Five has been criticized a lot because of the giant lack of realism, physics were not taken seriously and the majority of the dialogues seemed too artificial and not proper. F&F 6 did not improve this. Fast Five has been also criticized because the focus was on the action instead of the cars and tuning. This has been changed, which brings the series back to its roots. Real F&F fans will be just as entertained as by the previous movies. The soundtrack by 2 Chainz and Wiz Khalifa contains hip hop with a touch of electro. This is the secret recipe of F&F.The list of the used automobiles reaches from the Ford Escort RS 2000 (1974), over some classics like the Aston Martin DB7 (1994) to modern sport cars like the Dodge Charger SRT-8 (2012).Fast and Furious 6 is a good movie. After the Fast-Five-disappointment the series comes back to its roots. The realism has some flaws but just the average action movie mistakes which are nothing special these days. All in all you can say that F&F 6 is a classical F&F movie which appeals to the fans.Anatol T. and Tom S.",English-Class2014,"Apr 29, 2014"
2,What's to review?,"This is not a movie, its a clip-show of stunts. There's not a lot of point in reviewing ""Fast & Furious 6"" because nobody is going to watch this as a movie; you'll watch it to see the stunts and you'll watch it for only as long as the escalating scope and scale of those stunts can hold your attention. For what its worth, the heart of the (I use this term loosely) plot is a mcguffin. Usually this device is used to drive a story; in the case of ""F&F 6"" the only thing it drives is cars, trucks, a plane and...uhm, no, that might count as a spoiler. Let's just say there's a sequence that is a militarist's wet dream and walk away. No character development, an awesome array of destruction, no wit, no sense, and dialogue unworthy of an 8th grade melodrama. But we do get to watch, listen and cringe as Vin Diesel tries to do sensitive and romantic. THAT'S worth something. But in the end, remember that Paul Walker died making ""F&F 6,"" and that is both tragic and ironic.",jaywensley2004,"Mar 18, 2014"
8,Fast moving and better team players,"A perfect team movie ,where every character has enough time to show its talent.This movie was not all about action,there was enough humour in it.I liked the concept of team wise fight and perfect candidates for each guy including a white Hobbs (lol).I liked the fifth part also when they introduced Hobbs a tough cop which has entirely changed the concept of franchisee.Now they are not just racing cars they have turned to mercenaries like things. The action sequence were nicely executed and offered a quality experience for its viewers.I am eager to see next part of this franchise where the team has to face Jason Stathom.",arun-yadav92,"Jul 8, 2013"

9,Furious Frenzy,"My mind almost exploded many times throughout this movie. Myself as well as most of the folks at Universal I'm sure are surprised this franchise has made it to the sixth installment. There is now a huge ensemble of characters from various films to keep track of as well as new ones being introduced, so it comes as a huge compliment to say I was never confused throughout 'Furious 6' (the opening title). I have not been this giddy while watching a movie in theatres since 'Transformers'. It's probably Tyrese.Granted, these are two franchises who have hardly ever tried to court realism. This movie is so Ludicrous that the audience I was with was laughing at what was being portrayed on screen. 'To think this series used to centre around street racing', I thought as a cargo plane is coming down on a military base rife with explosions.This move is accomplished several times throughout the movie. It is no less thrilling the fourth time.Vin Diesel is passable, Paul Walker is the same as usual (kinda boring). The screen time is well divided among the entire cast with everyone getting their own moments. Tyrese has become the series comic relief which I don't mind. The fights, chases and races are superbly choreographed, top notch and the best part is the movie seems pretty self-aware. It irks me to find out that the next installment will be without its main director (Justin Lin, on board since the third).There are a few faults with the movie of course as no movie is without them. The decisions made by some of the characters make almost no sense. The plausibility angle is stretched beyond breaking point, even for the series. It wasn't revealed what the McGuffin that was driving the plot was until the last 30 minutes. I imagine the writers getting so far ahead of themselves that they resorted to one upmanship handing over the script of the last scene trying to screw each other over.This is just me nitpicking though, because in a way I found it all just so confounding what was happening on screen that I couldn't help but be engaged. A series that is able to get this far while standing on its shaky and genre shifting pillars deserves to be commended. See it in theatres!Rating: +3-3 -2 -1 0 +1 +2 +3",FilmGamer,"Jun 21, 2013"
4,Not a good story and neither it has satisfying action,"I expected too much of it and that might be my fault, but i am more than sure that the movie has not done enough justice with all the fans out there. The previous parts were all great but this sixth sequel has sunk the bar too low and with all the cheap and cliché-contained tricks, applied to make this movie do something, has failed badly.The only good parts are the hand-combat scenes and a little bit of humor, while the rest of this crappy movie can't be bought by the intelligent viewers.I did not wanted to write this review but i think it will save your precious time if you just watch those scenes.",dhoommachale008008,"Jul 18, 2013"
8,The Franchise is getting better with every film,"Fast & Furious 6 is an action film directed by Justin Lin and written by Chris Morgan. The film stars and ensemble cast of Vin Diesel, Late Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Sung Kang, Gal Gadot, Luke Evans, Gina Carano, and John Ortiz.This is the sixth installment of the Franchise.Hobbs is tasked with catching a team of mercenary drivers who manage to evade him every time. However, he enlists the help of Dominic and his team in exchange for full pardons for their past crimes.The series is getting superb and great by each film and the improved action sequences, stunts and fights had added more seasoning to the film.The plot of the film is straight and predictable just like most of the previous films but the crisp screenplay will keep you on the edge and will keep you engaged.Action is the major backbone of the film and few of the action scenes are just treat for any eyes. The stunts in the film keeps on improving with every film.Acting is great although the film has bunch of good actors but everyone had done their job with perfection and had done a tremendous work.Screenplay of the film is majorly predictable and the action scenes and stunts will keep you engaged through out.If you are a lover of action genre or lover of Fast and Furious franchise then this is a must watch film.",sauravjoshi85,"Sep 20, 2021"

9,There is room for Justin Lin and the crew to blow our minds once again when they reunite for FAST 7!,"Brothers (In Laws) race down the scenic road of Canary Islands in Spain as Mia gives birth to her baby boy. Brian a father now and Dom and the rest of the wanted crew have retired since their near unbelievable heist in Rio. Settled into a good life they all have left their pasts behind them whilst still holding onto the passion of pushing the pedal to the metal. The Samoan Thor; Hobbs turns up at Doms front door seeking help to bring to justice a gang of criminals headed by a ruthless ex-mercenary by the name of Shaw. Hobbs' main vantage was a photo inside the brown case envelope that he hands to Dom which has a photo of his old flame Letty who was presumed dead in FAST & FURIOUS (The 4th Movie). If it matters to Dom it matters to his entire crew. All hands once again on deck for an even more faster and an even more furious-er FAST & FURIOUS 6. This is round 4 for Justin Lin with this franchise which is over 12 years old. For 6 years he has pushed the limits further and further toy-ing the thin boundaries of reality and fantasy. The first scene from FAST 5 and every scene from F&F 6 make me wonder if his nitrous powered franchise would burn out. Just as one may look at a Nissan GTR fly by and say ""that's unbelievable"" , the audience will not stop thinking the same but then caught up in the brilliance of the moments simply believe. How Lin and the cast does this only they can explain. I just sat their mesmerized, entertained and at the edge of my seat the whole way. The franchise has never been about a genius plot. It's always been about the grease, nuts and powerful engines roaring under the hoods. The franchise breathed new life in American Muscle Cars worldwide bringing up trends and lifestyles of street racing. F&F 6 mixes the old and the new all up once again and revisits the beginning from 12 years ago, racing for pink slips, hot pursuits and reinventing cars. Computer Generated Imagery plays a pivotal role as most of the stunts require serious if not complete CGI assistance. The distance reached out by the stunt team is massive and every minute of their effort will be worth it when you see the Dodge and the Skylines take to the streets. There is only so much I can discuss without spoiling this for you. So if you have not watched the movie as yet get to it right now. A final comparison needs to be done since FAST 5 is my all time favorite so far. Let me wrap up by saying the heist in Rio has not been outdone as yet. There is room for Justin Lin and the crew to blow our minds once again when they reunite for FAST 7!

5,Fast & Furious 6 (2013),"Directed by Justin Lin. Starring Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Dwayne Johnson, Luke Evans, Tyrese Gibson, Sung Kang, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Gal Gadot, Gina Carano, Jordana Brewster, Shea Whigham, Elsa Pataky, John Ortiz, Joe Taslim. (PG-13)Using the thinnest strands of logic possible, Johnson recruits Diesel, Walker, and crew into carrying out a dangerous mission to take down a merc outfit led by former SAS officer Evans; Diesel also discovers that his girlfriend (Rodriguez) is still alive, despite being killed off in ""Fast & Furious"" (which was the fourth one in the series, so they say). Perhaps the dumbest outing yet (who's keeping track?) but also perhaps the most fried-brain-cell entertaining just for taking place in a parallel dimension where motivation, physics, logistics, and coherence are outlawed under penalty of death--or vehicular repossession, which would be a worse fate for these gearheads. The action is, as one would expect, even more outrageously insane than ever before, throwing in a smashed car tethered to a tank as it rolls down the highway and an out-and-out assault on a quadjet as it barrels down the world's longest runway. Dialogue is thuddingly awful (and sometimes barely even intelligible), performances marginally competent at best, blah blah blah, who cares; it's all about testosterone, adrenaline, shiny cars, flexed muscles, and impossible stunts. Hard to call any of this nonsense ""exciting"" (certainly not ""pulse-pounding""), but there's cheesy fun to be had, even if one is a little ashamed about it afterward.

4,"great action for car lovers, weak story for movie lovers","I didn't expect much better to be honest. This is the sixth 'Fast & Furious', I mean how much more can be said about a gang a villains who run around in fast cars? I enjoyed some of the visual and action, especially around central London but as far as the story and acting goes I feel it was rather weak. It's a story which has been told over and over again, the ex-villain (played by Vin Diesel) who corroborates with the police (played by Dwayne Johnson). There's nothing wrong with the plot itself, but when a movie is over two hours long you need to find a way of keeping it interesting.If you're a fan of this series then of course you should watch it, otherwise I would say don't bother.",shaunboyle1967,"Nov 26, 2013"
4,Some Really Ridiculous Action Scenes,"After their successful heist in Brazil which netted them $100 million dollars, ""Dominic Toretto"" (Vin Diesel) and his team have dispersed all over the world to enjoy life. Then one day ""Agent Luke Hobbs"" (Dwayne Johnson) appears on Dominic's doorstep and informs him that his former girlfriend, ""Letty"" (Michelle Rodriguez) is very much alive and working with an infamous criminal named ""Shaw"" (Luke Evans) on a mission to steal a very lethal military weapon which he can sell to the highest bidder. Wanting to prevent that at all costs Hobbs asks Dominic to reassemble his team in order to stop Shaw and in return all of them-to include Letty--will receive full pardons. Wanting very much to help Letty out Dominic agrees to his terms. But as good as Dominic's team is they soon find out that taking out Shaw and his team is much more difficult than they ever imagined. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film started out real well and definitely had the potential to be something very special. Unfortunately, the director (Justin Lin) once again got carried away and threw in some extremely preposterous stunts which ruined everything. Now I have no doubt that some viewers want action above everything else but there are others who also want some semblance of realism as well. Apparently Justin Lin doesn't understand that. Be that as it may I have rated this film accordingly. Slightly below average.",Uriah43,"Apr 24, 2017"

Toretto has gone from being a local street racer to the master mind of a heist of 100 million dollars. That sort of transformation is what the franchise has become, it isn't about street racing anymore. I am not condemning nor praising this transformation, just merely pointing it out. The rush of NOS is gone and instead we have the rush of hand to hand combat and gun fights.The movie starts with all the people from the previous movie(except for Leo and Santos) enjoying their life but Toretto decides to stop that because its time start a plot rolling. Hobbs who now wants to team up with Torreto's team (despite the incident at the end of the last movie) to stop the master criminal Shaw.The movie is hard to talk about without spoiling it so I will say that the movie is ridiculous and if that intrigues you, then go see it!",Kenta77,"Jun 27, 2015"

While the first 2 movies had little defying physics and no common sense scenes, usually reserved for the culmination, the further you go in the franchise the more absurd it gets. The 6th movie is full of plot holes, defines physics and lacks absolutely any logic. In fact there are scenes that lead to nowhere and do not contribute to the overall plot of the movie.As expected Fast and furious 6 has a lot of actions scenes that are more fantasy rather than action. It it is clear that no thought was put in the funny parts and the jokes but at least there are some.One can easily conclude that the move was purely made for money. It is focusing on the mindless masses who would watch anything as long as there are explosions, nice cars and good locking actors without thinking a bit about the plot of the move.

4,Disappointing,"I get movies are about entertaining the audience, I do, but I also hope to be entertained with talented casts and a good plot. The movie had some great ideas, but jus failed at portraying any realism. Many times throughout the film, the scenes were loosely connected and highly unrealistic with the main characters performing death defying acts alike an xmen or avengers...not car tuners. After a few of those, the film lost my attention. I just kept muttering, 'of course'. Also, some car scenes were forced in mindlessly having very little to do with what was happening. The movie twists and curveballs could've been better if they didn't flat out lie to the viewers. At the end, after learning the truth, a lot of scenes didn't make sense...not even a little. Then, there's the ending. Um, yeah, that could happen. I still gave the movie a 4 for the action and muscle car sound clips. This franchise always does those things well:)",jcmbruce,"May 25, 2013"

5,Better than 5 but...,"I thought that 5 featured less cars in lieu of ""story"". However, 6 was too ambitious in scope. How did street racers become a Interpol sanctioned crack team ? Supposedly, against ex-military ? We're supposed to suspend our disbelief and go along with it. I think the franchise should stop after Walker. it's a sign that the series is dead also. Now, up to 4, it was plausible, albeit unlikely, but it didn't try to set the film against the world stage of the greater good that rivals the Bond films. It needs to tone down the scale of plot to make it just as entertaining as uber realistic. For me, the series ended with 4. Before the cloak and dagger element of the sub standard 5 & 6.IF, and that's a big if, you have a Michael Gay fetish for nonsensical action, and gaudied classic cars done through West Coast Customs, this is right up your alley. Otherwise, watch Two Lane Blacktop, Last American Hero, and The Seven Ups for your classic muscle fix. I do on my breaks between turning wrenches.",moparmagnum-ra,"Jan 25, 2014"

1,CGI...Meh.....story...Meh....Script....Meh Spoiler alert!,"This movie honestly made me furious!! Story- the story was awful! even though for a action movie like this, story is really secondary, but the problem is they came changing what has happened in the past just to create crappy twists. A Twist would only work if it surprises the audience but at the same time can be accepted as it make logical sense. However, all these stupid twists that made no sense and threw alway all the story viewers watched and believed in previous episodes without logical explanations is a real put off. For example we all expected and knew Letty was dead, and now they bring her back in with crappy explanation by the plot. And ever since 2006 when Tokyo drift came out, viewers believed Han was killed by that crazy jap guy, and now they are changing that too just to bring in Jason Statham?, I m sure there are many other ways to include him in the plot. There are many other stupid twists but I am sure viewers get my point.Action and stunts- For movies like this, the action and stunts can be as crazy and unrealistic as possible and no many people would complain, but the important thing is that it has to look REAL. Fast 6 used way too much CGIs and it looked awful. If we look back in to most of the previous episodes, none of them were short of crazy stunts but at least they look real such as Fast two when Paul walker drove the car into the boat, or fast 5 when Paul walker and Vin diesel drove the car off the cliff and landed into the sea, i am not sure if those stunts were really made but aleast they look as if they did and that is what satisfy me for movie likes this. CGI is fine for movies like avengers where the plot is based on a fantasy world, but i am sure for most people that follows the FnFurious serious, they watch it because they like action and cars and wanted to see crazy Stuff they don't see in real life, but to see how the movie overly use CGIs makes me feel being cheated on and was a big disappointment to me.Script- Horrible, but not as bad as the two points discussed above so not going to get into it.Lastly, was anyone put off by the overly exposed product placement of Corona beer?",wj826117,"Jun 5, 2013"

1,Same stupid male stereotype,"I could not believe the scene where Jordana brewster and Michele rodriguez are with Tyrese Gibson trying to recruit or get information from another guy ( the blond guy shooting a spear gun or something like that) and they say they will do it because ""he is a man""can you believe that crap? can you imagine any director daring to include a scene where a guy says I will do the job because she is a woman ? of course not, that would be deemed sexist and outrage everyone , yet it is OK to do it to men. Then if that is not enough , the girls go down to where the blond guy is and the guy behaves like a neanderthal and gets his ass kicked by the girls It seems like this is becoming an obligatory scene in every action movie I watched. Is there a new law in Hollywood that guys need to act like assholes and get their asses kicked by women? How low have we gone as men if that is what everyone wants to see nowadays.",divingsofla,"Dec 21, 2014"
2,As Bad As It Gets,"I watched ""Fast Five"" off HBO GO a year or so ago (terrible!), and now my brother-in-law (who's coming in for Easter) is talking about us going to see the new FF7 film, so I thought I'd catch up and watch this 2013 ""Furious 6""- even worse!I always thought the original F&F was basically a remake of a much better action film- 1991's ""Point Break""- which I see they're now remaking-?? (ugh!)- only diff. is you replace the sky-diving and surfing with car-racing. Instead of under-cover agent Keanu Reeves; you have undercover agent Paul Walker (RIP), and instead of Patrick Swayze (RIP), you have Vin Diesel (and replace Swayze's ex-GF Lori Petty with Diesel's sister, Jordana Brewster). But I never liked the original film; not sure if I remember whether or not I've seen the first sequel- 2003's ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" (hope not; would've been an awful waste of 2 hours! LOL).But this sixth installment- wow!- where to begin--?? -the acting sucks, the writing sucks, but overall the direction sucks. I had a director friend of mine once explain to me that bad acting is a symptom of bad direction. I've see Diesel in several good works (""Pitch Black"", ""Boiler Room"", ""Knockaround Guys"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Find Me Guilty"") for instance, so I know he's talented. He obv. keeps returning to these films for the ka-ching!- and really, who could blame him-?? This movie series is symptomatic of how low the overall intelligence of the American movie-going public has become, so why not ride that gravy train all the way to the bank??.....as many frickin times as you can???

I couldn't understand what was happening in a lot of takes.Despite of this hater review, I am actually a huge fan of this series, so I am sad and disappointed. I enjoyed much more the fifth movie.The only thing I truly loved in this film was the main song ""We own it"". A super hit.If you prefer car racing movies I wouldn't recommend you so much this movie.

5,Like Watching Indian Action Movie,"I think this movie has met with its objective – a good popcorn movie. It was fun/ fast/ loud/and stylish. If you are looking for those things you will love this movie. If you look for story then look elsewhere.This movie is no longer related much to cars and engines like its predecessor but rather concentrated in action/ gun fight/ bombing. Through there are many cars chasing scenes it not really about the car anymore. (Don't they like assemble car anymore? all they do is went out to buy one) While the movie was really fun to watch many things that went on in here are just pure ridiculous that it turn to be so funny. It reminds me of watching Indian movie that no matter how beaten up or shot at - the guy is all he seem to get little bleeding at the side of his mouth. He is untouchable!!! And in the end anything will be alright. Even the dead are now undead (remind me the like of American soap opera like The Bold and the Beautiful)Another good thing about this movie is the set, it is freakishly huge!!! Involve the use of tank/plane/bike and so on. It is fun to watch that they don't seem to hold back the budget and bring about everything that they wish to get. Anyway while they did managed to make a really fun movie to watch the story and how unrealistic everything is just pure ridiculous. I recommended if you want to watch a mindless fast pace action movie.Rating: 5 /10",Mr_Sensitive,"Jun 9, 2013"
4,Lowest common denominator lucks out..,"Big, dumb, and sporadically fun.Fast and Furious 6 is an exploitation movie without the exploitation; the movie that puts the ridiculous into action; and the poor into acting. During the 13 hours this film went on for there are gyrating Londoners, a ludicrous story, explosions, a tank and er some cars though this is a fleeting diversion from the tedious plot, dreadful acting and banal direction.Who is this film for? Teenagers on a date who will be diverted from each other by the loud splashes of colour that assault you... sporadically.Highpoints: Luke Evans is clearly the highpoint. Though at times I expected him to say ""I would have gotten away with it to if it hadn't been for you pesky kids!"" Disappoints: Michelle Rodriguez, an actress with so much promise that seems to be deep-diving to the z-list.",stuart-573-245936,"May 26, 2013"
5,Noticeably Sillier,"Firstly I'll state by saying fast and furious is my favourite in the series. Having fallen off the franchise for a bit I picked up years later and found that although there were some over the top sequences, the film felt more grounded, took its time to build up, and the motivations of each character made sense. Sadly, I can't say the same here. The film starts with the scene of a robbery and some hammy dialogue from the Rock who rolls off his partners CV rather than simply say hello like a normal person. After this it's declared there's a surviving witness who the rock proceeds to beat the hell out of with no consequences, all the while it shot as a bit of a joke. It was at this point I knew the tone of the film was going to be a problem.So a little bit of a retcon takes place revealing lettie is alive to give Dom some much needed reason to come out of retirement and in fairness, what else were they going to do at this point? What bothered me is the ease in which Dom is tracked down by Hobbs and the inexcusable logic of Paul Walker; a new father feeling compelled to join in risking his life for the ride. He's actually egged on by his wife (girlfriend, I duno) and really does stretch my patience.So the film gets going and familiar tropes of tracking people through vehicle mods all crop up again. The banters largely fun between the team as it was in the last film but I can't help but find the moments of silliness (the rocks dive from a freeway onto a vehicle roof) grate on me a little too much. My score usually is 6/10 if decent and 7/10 if solid.... But if this film was on TV I'd probably skip next time. So with that in mind I'm giving this a 5/10.",adam_evans14,"Jun 1, 2020"
5,"If nothing else, it's entertaining.","I'll be honest I had never previously seen a Fast and Furious film before - shameful I know. However, despite not knowing the characters etc. I personally thought that the film was awful in many ways. the fakeness of it was unreal and having lived in London all my life its amazing to see scenes where there are no other vehicles around and so on. However, even allowing for the truly ridiculous events, I thoroughly enjoyed the film. There was never a dull moment and it was pretty unpredictable.Overall, although I thought that this was a pretty poor film I found it fairly entertaining and would recommend watching it and to be honest, even if you don't fancy it, just joking about the fake and stupid scenes and parts of the plot with my mates was enough for me to enjoy the film.",alexreyn22,"Sep 9, 2013"
5,Hey I liked the last one but can we settle down a bit now guys?,"Nonsensical action is straight ahead, and we're smashing the NOS button. Fast 6 begins the descent into insanity, and I'm kind of here for it. I don't know how self-aware the cast and crew are, but at least when it comes to execution they're bringing their A game. The emphasis on practical effects is still here, and the characters maintain their charisma. The plot is absolutely ridiculous of course but who watches the vroom vroom bang bang car movies for that? This is a shounen anime now and an absolute magnet for teenage boys.I didn't ever intend to return to the franchise after watching 7 when it released, but a friend wanted to watch through them to see how they got to whatever nonsense was shown in the Fast X trailer. I didn't really care for the car-centric films earlier on, and don't usually watch over-the-top action films. So I liked the balance act that Fast Five pulled, and now I'm still watching because of a morbid curiousity. This entry has a final sequence with a foundation that's rightly ridiculed to this day. And within that sequence there's even sillier moments that we burst out laughing at. I suppose I was entertained short-term, but I'm afraid of the damage to my later years. It also tries to tell the viewer that Tokyo Drift takes place after this chronologically. They were using flip phones in Tokyo Drift. I don't think so.So, dumb movie, probably worth watching. I think the writer is genuinely trying, which helps a lot. I can't believe there's 5 more of these.",H4wke,"Nov 6, 2024"
5,Furious 6 (2013) Wear starting,"The biggest problem with Fast and Furious 6 is that it is between the fifth and seventh films in the franchise, which are among the best. However, by itself it is already a weak film. The action is fun at times, but it is generic and fails to convey a sense of danger. It's a film that is much more interesting at the beginning, but throughout the film it becomes exhausting and the third act is extremely weak. The whole story is very boring, it doesn't hold up and tries to be extraordinary, but it fails to entertain either through the narrative or the action. The characters have an interesting relationship, but all the subplots created are extremely uninteresting and many lead nowhere, meaning that the depth that should occur does not occur. It's not a bad film, but it's mediocrity.",claszdsburrogato,"Jan 11, 2024"

4,Disappointing,"Overall its a disappointing movie in the franchise. The 6 movies have had a mixed bag, with tokyo drift being the best in my opinion. The cinematography and vibrant colours mixed with the culture has more to offer.But moving onto ""Fast & Furious 6"" There really is no acting in this movie. I wasn't expecting much from Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Vin Diesel, but expected more from Paul Walker (Brian). Also, some the scenes seem to be edited so much as to piece together scenes that don't mix well. On the other hand, most of the action scenes make you feel like you're chasing Shaw yourself which for me adds to the action impact. While the plot is very silly, it will get a few laughs out of you (yes it seems more of an action comedy). And the movie keeps you on the end of your seats. So if you're a fan of this franchise, or any action franchise, see it. If you're more into drama or comedy (although this movie has some of each), I suggest you see something else.",hamish-jon-mclean,"May 29, 2013"

4,A low point of the series,"I had to write this review because I couldn't believe my eyes seeing that this is the highest rated F&F of the series. The series had lost its identity completely by this point, becoming a generic action movie with a nod to the cars here and there. If you're looking for unique movies with a real look at car culture the first three movies are iconic and very good films too. The 4th was where they transitioned into more generic action but was still a solid film, but this was absolute trash. I feel like I'm being generous with 4/10. I was openly laughing with my friends in the cinema at the ridiculous aeroplane scene, featuring the 18.37 mile long runway (BBC estimate) and some of the most ridiculous unbelievable almost superhere-esque fighting scenes. I think that scene is an accurate representation of the whole movie. Boring generic action, but ridiculous over the top and badly done action sequences that were embarrassing to watch.",blightersaurus,"Sep 16, 2024"
5,More like a superhero cartoon for kids than a good action movie,"Like I said, the movie has some interesting racing scenes, in addition to fighting and shooting scenes. It looks impressive and thrilling, but everything makes no sense if all the characters are healthy after that. They couldn't have had that much luck. I know Giselle died saving Han but that death was funny too. No one would die like that. She's not even a superhero. Not to mention that the fight scene at the end of the movie on the big plane is very lengthy and meaningless. Dom decides to stay behind to retake the suitcase despite the danger because he believes he will survive after that? Even his sister and his girlfriend were saved earlier? Too ridiculous. All in all, the movie is a bit entertaining, but it looks too much like an animated superhero movie, and the story isn't very dramatic.",dakuchonekobing,"Jan 31, 2022"

1,Another part of the franchise so dead I'm honestly baffled how it makes any money,"I hated FF5 so much that I should have stopped there, and 6 was predictably even worse. I was paying close attention, and I can honestly count on my fingers the number of times that the dialogue *wasn't* overacted, extremely contrived, and/or totally unnecessary. And I'm pretty sure every one of the acceptable lines was the Rock going off script.At least the action is cool, right? Well, actually, no. The action reveals an incredulous lack of understanding of basic physics, and the lack of realism in every single action sequence makes the scenes boring and even unwatchable.The plot, dialogue, and action is inexcusably horrendous.

No rating,Knows its audience and works well as a result,"There is something for films that know their place in life. Sometime blockbusters will try and dress themselves up as something more worthy or important than they are but with this sixth film there is no risk of that accusation being made about the Fast & Furious franchise, because this film certainly is no under no illusions about what it needs to do. As a result we get a very simple crowd pleasing film with plenty of big ridiculous action, very easy characters and plotting and plenty to look at. This isn't to say that it isn't nonsense or that it performs in any way other than the very limited parameters it sets for itself, but at least it is honest with itself and the viewers.To speak of the strengths first, the action is not only well executed but it is also enjoyably silly in how OTT it is. At times it hurts itself by trying to make a serious moment out of a ridiculous one (such as Dominic's mid-air Matrix moment with Letty) but mostly it goes big and doesn't do anything to hide that it is just having fun and we should too. The plot really only exists to create some frame for the action and to be honest the film could have benefited from losing 20 minutes of plotting and making more room for more of what it does best. There are too many scenes of discussion between characters; in a normal film I may complain about action pushing these out, but here I think more should have been cut as really I cared for nobody and it added nothing. The plot is also full of nonsense; the 25 mile long runway is the one that people mention, but there is loads of stuff that makes no sense but mostly, like the runway, you go with it because it is dumb fun.The cast are best when they remember this too – but too often the material pushes them to try and ""act"" and few of them can. Diesel continues to lack charisma but in a way it is nice he has found something to do. Likewise Walker, not a man with much range, he seems very at home in this franchise and he is pretty I guess. Johnson is a walking mountain who has a lot of charisma and presence even though his character makes no sense. Gibson is fun, Luda is so-so and Kang is fine but oddly tragic throughout. In terms of the female roles, although there was still some gratuitous shots of models, there seemed to be fewer and less of a sense of objectifying. Rodriguez is OK but I liked the presence of Carano – not much of an actress but good physical presence. Gadot is gorgeous while Brewster is wisely left out of it as the abundance of character baggage is obvious.This is not a good film by any means – it is ridiculous in its action and really doesn't care about the plot at all, but if you feel the same way then there is much to enjoy. It could easily have lost 20 minutes of narrative and be been for it, but when the action is going on it is very easy to switch off the brain and enjoy it. Yes it is aiming its sights low and simple, but sometimes it is nice when a film is honest with you and then delivers all it promises.",bob the moo,"Sep 14, 2013"

No rating,All Roads lead to this.,"Fast and Furious 6.Well the movie carries one hell of a explosive punch. The Stunts are top notch. The Acting is petty good. If you are a fan of the Fast and Furious franchise you'll consider this one of the best in the series. If you are not a fan you won't be pleased . simple as that. I like this franchise. Right from the first one to this one. I consider them to be examples of high action and adventure done in a classic way. The story is simple. Supercop Hobbs is chasing a criminal named Shaw. Shaw uses a crew like Dom's to perform impossible robberies. Shaw is the master of the roads. Hobbs finds out that Shaw's Second in Command is Dom's lost love Letty long presumed dead. When Shaw and his crew steal a high tech Chip. Hobbes goes to Rio and recruits Dom and his team with a promise of a full pardon for them. So they can return Home. Dom pulls his team together and they get to work bring down Shaw. The theme of Fast and Furious that has been constant is family. And it is strongly put into play with this film. As Dom tells Brian. ""You don't turn your back on family. Even when they turn their back on you."" For Brian it's about getting a dangerous criminal off the streets and returning home. For Dom it's about putting his family together and resuming his life back in L.A. But it's also for Dom about the truth. nothing else matters. The film is sleek . And well done ,It's done with a style and flair you will enjoy. That is if you are a fan. If you're not a fan well check this film out anyways. It's also one hell of a crime noir film . You can forget the cars and you still have a well written well acted crime film. Vin Diesal gives a pretty sharp performance as Dom as always. Paul Walker provides the moral compass of the family. And Dwayne Johnson Provides the spark that gets them into action. Each actor in this film knows his or her job. The film ties in Fast and Furious :Tokyo drift. And it sets up the next one. The series as a whole fits into one whole story. A very impressive feat. Like I said if you're a fan of the franchise you'll enjoy it. If you're not Fan well give it a chance anyways. If you want to be surprised.",bluesman-20,"Dec 18, 2013"
No rating,Exciting mechanics,"We don't watch these for the superb insights, do we? The storytelling is mechanical and simple, recycled from spare parts of other movies, here a dark caper that owes both to Bond and Nolan. The plan is to know enough at any given moment, and very crisply, to know where we are in the larger vista, except the parts moved by the villain which carry the surprises.It's all so we can lunge ahead with what we came to see: motion mechanics.This is my go-to franchise for expertly calibrated precision in the cinematic engine. I'm not even a gearhead, the whole world with its thuggish posing is far from my sensibility. I just like to watch. The container may be simple and dumb but the pure energy it creates in the eye excites me to no end, this is stuff I want to see. Expert work in the edits, impacts, gravity. Just so you know, the editing team is headed by a guy who has worked for Bay, John Woo in M:I 2, and Tony Scott. To have these astounding stunts, it means we're going to have corresponding leaps in story logic. We do, some truly mind-numbing ones. Remember the opening of Goldeneye with Bond diving off the cliff after that plane? We have several more ridiculous stunts here—the pinnacle is perhaps the one where Diesel flies several feet in the air from a speeding car, catches in mid-air his loved one who is about to plunge to her death, and they roll together on the opposite side of the highway. (This connection between visual and logical leaps is metaphysical, but more on that in other comments)It's ludicrous of course, but I can buy it because it is the pinnacle of a very clearly mapped urge to have her back. And this is also why the stunts work so well; it's the same very clearly mapped linear narrative space, usually streets and cars snaking after each other, within that linear action space we have constant explosions in the eye—Tony Scott terrain, Unstoppable being the appex. French Connection is the template of this thing, with its big chase in three linear vistas, a film I like more because it carries the same 'real' gravity to the cop story, whereas this is M:I crazy. Which is why the finale with the plane fizzles into noise, it's just messy visual information, the sort that Bay deals in.",chaos-rampant,"Jul 21, 2013"
No rating,"fast6, then a 7?","Okay when the original ""fast and the furious"" came out i thought it was decent the acting was decent, but really, now i think that the only reason why we all go to see this series is for the women and car races. But now i feel that the series is losing its fire just like ""paranormal activity"" only Idiots and dumb people would go see that series and waste money. Anyways now the ""fast and the furious"" series is more like a adventure movie were either they get screwed over or they have to do a job for the government.I think the reason why they decided to add Statham in the mix with D'wane Johnson was to try and revive a dead story line that they screwed up on by making ""Tokyo drift"", and decided to run a prequel off that though it does end by them going to Tokyo but if the studios decide to make more i think nobody will go and see it due to the lack of interest they might have in the story if it continues",hawaiiwarrior08,"Jun 23, 2013"
No rating,"More NOS, Less Plot","What has beautiful women, fast cars, comedy, and action? No I'm not talking about a college spring break in Miami, Florida; I'm talking about the latest installment in the Fast and Furious Franchise. Last night two of my buddies and I had the privilege of seeing an early showing of Furious 6, and like always I have plenty to say. Let's get started.For those who saw Fast Five, you know that Brian (Paul Walker) and Mia (Jordana Brewster) were expecting their first child, Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew were all millionaires and Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) was ""searching"" for them. Number six picks up pretty much two months later, showing how the heist crew, minus the two demolition experts, are enjoying their well-earned rewards. In F&F world though, nothing every remains quiet for long as a ghost from the past, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) stirs the embers of intrigue and revenge in Dom resulting in the team coming together to find her. Now let's start the review.The opening of this movie is a bit slow at the beginning, but provides enough laughs and information to refresh old fans memory of the plot, while making a small foundation for those new to the series. After a ridiculous interrogation scene, a rushed planning scenes, and some more jokes later, bam we get to our first action scene. Now you might be thinking, oh great another loud sequence of cars rushing through the road sending pedestrians and bystanders dodging to the sides. For the most part you are right, but this time they are chasing after a band of mercenaries led by Luke Evans attempting to steal some government secret weapon component. While this goal is not the most unique, it's at least a slight change up to the typical motives behind the adrenaline pumping, engine roaring speed fest that we've seen for the last thirteen years. The stunts are still impressive, the cars so sleek and beautiful it hurts, and the music so aggressive that it blends into an exciting ride. Of course this wouldn't be worthy of being an F&F movie if there was only one chase scene right Don't worry number six has a few more car scenes that continue to show off the world of stunt driving, CGI and mediocre plots centered around finding ways to make cars go fast.One should note though that the action isn't just limited to cars. Nope F&F6 opens has taken the liberty to add more diversity in their butt kicking arsenal. With the Rock taking more screen time, fans get to see a few more fist fights and body slamming that allows you to see what the Rock is cooking. When Johnson isn't putting the hurt on someone, the rest of the gang takes their shots at either putting a cap in someone, or pulling out some martial arts skills to defeat their opponents. Some of these fights rock, while others are merely meant to have you laughing as the heroes throw out witty banter. Despite some of the ridiculousness and over the top stunts, the action will still have action fans on the edge of their seats, hooting for their favorite characters.Putting the action aside though, the movie does have other qualities that help balance things out. For one thing the comedy in this movie is still strong, especially when Roman (Tyrese Gibson) takes the stage. The feisty, self-involved, ladies' man is the center of the comedic pillar pulling all the other characters in to a friendly rivalry that symbolizes the brotherhood between the team. From my standpoint, I think Gibson must make these jokes daily, as the acting made it seem that it was just an ordinary day, especially when going toe to toe with Tej (Ludacris).For me the comedy also helped make up for some of the plot holes this movie had. The lack of reasoning behind Evans attacks left me feeling as this guy was just crazy. The plot revolving around Dom and Letty though was the better developed of the story, with much of the movie focusing on the internal struggles occurring between the two. While the romance is not my favorite part, the movie does a good job not rubbing love in my face, and actually uses the plot to bring in other ghosts from the pasts to strengthen the movie. Laughs and love aside, the movie also does a nice job keeping you on your toes as to who will survive the ordeal. Many times there are close calls where you are not sure if someone will live, and yes there are even some deaths that upset my friends, despite how predictable it was. All in all though, the plot isn't the worst thing I've seen, it just was lacking in some areas that I felt failed where the fifth one succeeded. Luckily we still have a nice balance of characters/actors in the movie, with the exception of a few who took a major back seat to Dom and Letty, (i.e. Mia, Tej, and Elena). While the action was impressive, the camera work still had a few spastic moments that were either a bit dizzying or a bit annoying. As for the villain, again the guy had skills and a lethal team, but they failed to really build him up or give him some pizazz to make him stand out as a great bad guy. Regardless F&F6 is a good movie and keeps the series alive for at least one more movie to come, watch the credits. Acting is just like before, the action is still rip roaring fun, and the comedy is golden to keep you laughing the whole time. Yet some weaknesses in plot and centering on Letty/Dom hindered this movie to make it less enjoyable for me. My scores are below: Action/Crime/Thriller: 7.5 Movie: 7.0",rgkarim,"May 24, 2013"
