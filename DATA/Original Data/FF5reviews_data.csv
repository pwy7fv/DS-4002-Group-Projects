8,So far the best and most entertaining of this series.,"This is the film that single-handedly got me to give the rest of the series a shot, for better or worse. It's a nice change of pace from the previous films where it abandons the street race angle (how far could you have taken that anyway?) and goes into the direction of a heist action flick with cars. Dwayne Johnson is a great addition and really adds to the series embracing the goofiness of its premise. So yeah, still the best this franchise had, and that's kind of rare for a franchise on its fifth film. The action for the most part is really handled well and a lot of fun to watch. The cast as an ensemble are very charismatic which no doubt makes it more fun for audiences to see a cast that has so much diversity and it's not done with generic stereotypes but just a bunch of people with a common interest. Overall a very entertaining action flick.",tmm_8705,"Jun 28, 2013"
8,Back together for round Five,"Now when a long running series like The Fast And The Furious get sequels it is always a challenge to go out and try impress movie goers.However the series always tops itself with the recent sequels and Fast Five proof that's anything is possible with the right minds.The plot this time take place after Fast and Furious 4 left all with Brian O'Conner played by Paul Walker, Dominic Teretto Played by Vin Diesel, Mia Toretto played by Jordana Brewster head for Brazil to escape the law after a job with Vince Played by Matt Schulze went wrong. Which leads to them being hunted by Luke Hobbs Played by Dwayne Johnson who along with Elena Played by Elsa Pataky begin to hunt them down. Also returning are Roman Played by Tyrese Gibson, Tej Played by Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Han Played by Sung Kang, Gisele played by Gal Gadot. Reyes Played by Joaquim de Almeida who serves as the Film Main Antagonist.Story wise the plot is very good because it features the return of many of the characters from the series which is very good and moves the series along. Plus the film requires you to pay attention or you'll miss something. Plus you see the characters grow in this film from the last films.What drives the film like the other films is that the stunts from start to finish that defines The Laws of Physic and why I love this series because the cast and crew are always driven to push the limits and hold nothing back, Fast Five is the example of it.There is just a lot for this film that I recommend seeing for yourself where you'll be amazed and how you can do a sequel with the right minds.With awesome stunts, great action and plot you'll be glad you watch this film.I give Fast Five an 8 out of 10",Terryfan,"Apr 3, 2015"

No rating,Best Fast & Furious movie,This is the best Fast and furious movie in my opinion. The franchise reinvented itself here and the series really benefited from it. This had a much better and believable plot and of course the Rock made the movie really good as well. 8.5/10,0U,"Feb 23, 2020"

10,Definitely the best Action flick in the series from 2011,"Fast Five (2011) is one of the best Action heist films of all 5. film series of all time. This film reunites all actors from the previous films. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster , Tyrese Gibson , Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang, Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot, Tego Calderon and Don Omar, the gang are all here! They are all cast from the previous installments. 
The Director brings all new actors in the cast crew: Joaquim de Almeida, Dwayne Johnson and Elsa Pataky. The script, the players, the action scenes, the story. Everything about this film is awesome! This film kicks ass. Is my second favorite best film in the series franchise. This film for me even beats Furious 7. Cause Furious 7 is not that good as this film is. The far of the highest best films ever. It's actually probably my favorite movie that I've ever seen. If you like any of the other fast and furious movies SEE THIS ONE!!!!! It's a Epic movie watch it till all the way to the end.Fast Five picks up, literally, right where Fast & Furious left off. Dom (Vin Diesel) is on his way to prison when his partner, former undercover detective Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), and his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) stage a daring (albeit highly unlikely) prison-bus break. On the run from the police, the FBI and the media, the three hightail it across the border and head even further south, all the way to Rio de Janeiro. There, they decide to lay down, lay low and avoid any unwanted attention. Nah, I'm just kidding. They do what any international fugitives would do: rob a train, double cross a local crime lord named Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) and his right-hand man Zizi (Michael Irby), put themselves on the radar of a ludicrously musclebound U.S. Diplomatic Security Service agent (Dwayne Johnson), and set out to steal untold millions from Reyes. That's right, it's One Last Heist for Dom and Brian. Not that anyone should be foolish enough to think this is the last we'll see of the led-foot duo; not after Fast Five revved up $600 million at the worldwide box office. (Be sure to sit through the first chunk of end credits for a nice little surprise.) Fast Five boasts incredible action scenes that are all varied and equally exciting. The film is full of clean, well choreographed shots that are easy to watch and the cast works great as a whole unit, making the film's running time breeze by. The heist in Rio De Janeiro was amazing An energetic, high-octane. The film was brilliant and smart it was action fun Entertained. The fight scenes between Dwayne Jonson and Vin Diesel was tremendous. I was happy that they put someone (Dwayne Jonson) in the movie that was so smart like Dom (Vin Diesel) was. Luke Hobbs as A Diplomatic Security Service agent to track down Dom and his crew was awesome! He did a brilliant job In this Action packed sequel film! Just Lin deliver us a high octane Action packed story filled with full of cars and shootings in his film.Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Dwayne Johnson lead this all-star all-action movie with outrageous stunts, incredible cars and beautiful girls that pushes the limits into the red and beyond! The legendary Dom Torreto (Vin Diesel) partners with outlaw cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) on the opposite side of the law in exotic Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Hunted by ruthless Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and an army of corrupt cops working for a deadly drug kingpin. Torreto and O'Conner reunite the gang from previous Fast adventures to pull off one last job - an insane heist worth $100 million! ""Five Times The Action!, Five Times the Fury!"" I love this film to death and I love how they were planning to rob a Police Station. The first half was a little boring, but the second half was fast paced entertained filled with action. I love this film and everything about it. I love that it is 2.hrs long so that it can tell the whole story.When developing Fast Five, Universal Studios deliberately departed from the street racing theme prevalent in previous films in the series, to transform the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By doing so, they hoped to attract wider audiences that might otherwise be put off by a heavy emphasis on cars and car culture. Fast Five is considered the transitional film in the series, featuring only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as gun fights, brawls, and the heist of $100 million. The production mounted a comprehensive marketing campaign, marketing the film through social media, virtual games, cinema chains, automobile manufacturers, and at NASCAR races.",ivo-cobra8,"Oct 18, 2015"
7,The first sequel in the series that's actually worth your dollar,"Sure the original was something fresh, new, and somewhat original. But the sequels have been anything but. Yeah i know it's high octane fun, but you can say the same thing about Michael Bay films. Am i saying that these sequels are as bad as Michael Bay films? No, but each one offers nothing new, well, unless you count drifting, and that isn't saying a lot. Hopefull this new installment can bring something fresh to the table.I never thought i would say this, but i actually enjoyed this movie. I went in with low expectations, and came out pretty damn satisfied. Sure the movie had a lot of the same moving parts, but what really made this one stand out is how it actually changed the pace of how they normally do things.First, they didn't have a damn drag race every 10 minutes. In fact, they barely had any. Which really is a genius idea, because when the time did come to have an awesome driving sequence, you were begging for it. Finally, someone with brains stepped into this movie and said let's save all of our bullets and unleash them in the end.So with a series that relies heavily on their driving sequences and less on their script, how do you keep your audience entertained? Well, the first step is to incorporate another major actor, enter The Rock. Next, you really need to buff up your script. Okay, here is where it gets both good and bad. It's good because the movie takes a ton of it's credit from the ""Ocean 11"" films. Yeah, it's stealing an idea, but it injecting more action into it, which is pretty cool. But the reason why i say it's also bad, is because it's still packed with bad cheesy one-liners, poor acting, and some really tarnished plot outlines. But does that take anything away from the fun.......not really.Bottom Line, okay people, here is your first action movie worth seeing this year. No, i am not one of those people who hold these 'Fast and Furious' films on a high pedestal. Not since the first one have i given anything over a decent review. But i can say with confidence that this one is actually worth your hard earned dollar. Sure it's slightly cheesy, packed with impossible action, and sure it steals some plot outlines from other films, but i like i said earlier, it's still fun to watch. So with that being said, the question remains.....is this the best one in the series? I still say no, but this movie comes damn close. Closer that any of the other ones, thats for damn sure. On a time line, this should have followed up the original",blackmambamark,"May 1, 2011"
9,Fast Five: The Big Climax Of The Franchise,"Without a shadow of a doubt, The Fast And Furious Franchise reaches it's peak in this installment with breathtaking action and a sense of friendship and brotherhood shared by the lead characters. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker return and are joined by newcomer Dwayne Johnsson for the 5th Fast and Furious Movie, entitled ''Fast Five''. There's not much to say about this, the action movie of the year, except it's fantastic shots of Brazil, the heist plot that brings even more excitem«ent to the table and overall the continuation of the story of these characters we have come to love and support, as their bond streghtens over time.In Conclusion, if you love the franchise then you can't miss it9/10",CMTiago,"Aug 26, 2013"
7,Best since the original.,"""Home sweet home"" utters Diesel's beefcake criminal Dom Toretto to Walker's baby-faced ex-cop Brian O'Conner as they sit in Toretto's souped up muscle car ready to race along the streets of Rio de Janeiro. There's more than a hint of irony in this; fans of the Fast franchise will know exactly what Dom means. The sequels spawned from the highly successful first film have been a mixed bag appealing to different tastes. Some have been mildly entertaining in their own way, but the one major issue they've all shared is a lack of recurring characters and follow-on narratives. 2009's Fast & Furious partially rectified that by having the main four from the original movie return, but it's this fifth entry that really starts to bring the whole series together.There's supporting characters from every instalment featured here – Matt Schulze's Vince from number one; Tyrese's big-mouthed Roman and Ludicrous' Tej from 2 Fast 2 Furious; Sung Kang's charismatic Han from Tokyo Drift; and Gal Gadot's sexy Gisele from F&F – with a post-credits cameo to cap it off. Scribe Chris Morgan has obviously done his homework as, in addition to the 'who's who' line-up of co-stars, there are references to the previous movies (and characters that don't appear) and he introduces subplots that help build on earlier story lines. This integration of the Fast universe, along with the marvellously tongue-in-cheek mood, notches up a level of interest not before seen in the car-crazy franchise.After taking a new course with Tokyo Drift, and failing to impress with Fast & Furious, filmmaker Justin Lin has well and truly ignited the series with exciting set pieces and lashings of well placed humour. He still struggles to effectively call the shots when exposition (or mere conversation) is required; however he clearly has a handle on shooting the various fast-paced action scenes. There is a spectacular heist of luxury cars aboard a train (with a marvellously ridiculous denouement); a Bourne-esque free-running chase along roof tops; and a bruising hand-to-hand melee between The Rock and big Vin.Of the major stars, it's Fast newcomer Dwayne Johnson who shines the brightest. His epic bad-ass cop makes Toretto look like an absolute sissy, which is no easy feat. He also boasts many of the film's greatest lines and comes away looking the least corny – something Diesel and Walker are evidently use to by now. The chalk and cheese pairing of the two wannabe action stars brings with it a decent slab of shonky acting. Chrome-domed Diesel is especially silly and unconvincing when required to open his mouth, but he looks good behind the wheel of a car and adds plenty to the unapologetic macho atmosphere.Thanks to Morgan's decent script, Lin's solid grasp on the action and Johnson's tough-as-nails turn, this latest addition to a franchise that appeared to be running on fumes has just stepped on the gas.3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Average, 3 - Good, 4 - Great, 5 - Brilliant)",Troy_Campbell,"Apr 21, 2011"
8,Still the best of the bunch!,"Yeah out of all the movies, this one still stands as my favorite! It basicly have everything you can ask for from a Fast and Furious movie!This movie Feels like the finale movie in the series, as it brings together our favorite characters from the previous movies, in the current timeline! It is over the top, but not as much as the later entries! The plot is also easy to understand, and not overly complex!This is an easy to enjoy action packed thrillride, with emotional, satisfying and intense moments! The last part of the movie is just bonkers and i LOVE it!

6,The Day When Puerto Rico Has Become Rio de Janeiro,"The former agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and his girlfriend Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) rescue her brother Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) during the transportation to the prison and they flee to Rio de Janeiro. They rob a car from custody and find that the powerful drug lord Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) has a US$ 100,000.00 in a safe located inside the police station and protected by corrupt policeman. Dominic invites his skilled crew to steal the dirty money and achieve their freedom, moving to a country without extradition to the USA. Meanwhile the tough FBI agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) comes to Brazil with an elite force to arrest Dominic and Brian.""Fast Five"" is an entertaining action film, with cartoonish shootings and fights and an insane car race that destroys dozens of cars and locations. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Dwayne Johnson are synonym of great action scenes, and is nice to see the gorgeous Jordana Brewster that speaks a perfect Portuguese and Elsa Pataky.For Brazilian and specially ""cariocas"" (natives from Rio de Janeiro), this film is also a comedy with the stereotyped Rio and a great quantity of mistakes. Most of the scenes are shot in Puerto Rico; most of the accent of actors speaking Portuguese are not from Rio but from São Paulo or from native in Spanish; Hernan Reyes is not a Brazilian name and Joaquim de Almeida is an actor from Portugal; there are ridiculous geographical mistakes, like for example, the references to the noble areas of Avenida Atlântica and Leblon. The sequences in the slums are also funny, since the modus operandi of armed drug dealers is totally different, using snipers from the top of the hills and barriers in the accesses to avoid the police and paramilitary forces. An American force would never have jurisdiction in Brazil. Last but not the least, there are many corrupt cops in Brazil, but never in such level. I do not understand why the production has not used Brazilian actors and actresses in supporting roles to giver credibility to the footages with the external landscapes of Rio de Janeiro. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Velozes & Furiosos 5 - Operação Rio"" (""Fast & Furious 5 – Operation Rio"")",claudio_carvalho,"Sep 17, 2011"
10,I wasn't expecting much from this...but WOW.,"I enjoyed the movie so much, that I came onto IMDb and registered myself just so that I can post a review. The movie was packed with jaw dropping, eye popping action from beginning to end. The drama had a mix of sadness, comedy and seriousness which were all mixed in together so beautifully to give a consistency to keep the viewer starring at the screen and being involved in the movie rather than daydreaming about other things. In my honest opinion I would say that it is the best Fast & Furious movie to date. I want to go see it again!(by the way, I realise that this isn't the best review in the world or might even be an awful review, the point is that I enjoyed the movie thoroughly and felt I should contribute to it's high average ratings).",mus_ne_17,"Apr 23, 2011"

2,Appalling,"There's a limit to how many sequels you can make to an action movie that was not very smart to begin with and still end up with something watchable. They change the scenery a bit, one-up the carnage and the special effects, add a little seasoning and shake well.The thing that made the Fast and the Furious really good was always the fast cars and the portrayal of the street racer subculture with some crime and action on the side. Unfortunately Fast Five fails to deliver the proved formula - the action is too prominent, and frankly feels ridiculous most of the time. The street racing and the tuner scene are moved to the side to make room for more gunfights and ridiculous action scenes. The plot is predictably weak and while the regular cast makes a good effort of keeping the whole thing afloat, their efforts are undermined by some of the new faces (anyone like wrestling?).The whole thing feels like a meaningless series of action scenes glued together with a few romantic moments meant to tend the female demographic. There is no sense of flow throughout the movie and I never felt part of the action, it was not even remotely believable. I wish I could say that the movie was not really bad, just mediocre but that would be lying. Spare yourself some disappointment and go watch something else.",explicit-1,"May 8, 2011"
7,'FAST FIVE' gets 3.5 out of 5.,"'FAST FIVE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) I was never a big fan of the original 'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS' and thought it was severely over-hyped. With each sequel though I think the franchise has gotten better (although I never saw the third chapter: 'TOKYO DRIFT'). This one (for the first time) brings together key cast members from all of the other films including Vin Diesel (who sat out the second film and only did a cameo in the third), Paul Walker (who was absent from the third film), Jordana Brewster (who missed the second and third films) as well as Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang, Cal Gadot and Tego Calderon (who all co-starred in one or two of the other films). It also adds Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson to the cast and fans finally get to see a long anticipated fight scene between he and Vin Diesel. The film is directed by Justin Lin (who also directed the last two films) and written by Chris Morgan (who wrote the last two films as well). It all adds up to a pretty entertaining action film that should definitely please most fans of the genre as well as fans of the franchise.The film opens directly where the last one left off with former FBI agent turned outlaw Brian O'Conner (Walker) and girlfriend Mia (Brewster) breaking Mia's brother and Brian's buddy and partner in crime Dominic Toretto (Diesel) out of prison, by attacking the prison bus he's on. They then flee to Brazil and due to a botched car heist (where DEA agents are murdered) they're moved to the top of America's most wanted list. The baddest federal agent around, Lucas Hobbs (Johnson), is then put on assignment to track them down. O'Conner and Toretto then decide to pull one last big job on the crooked businessman, Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), who framed them by stealing $100 million of his laundered money. They bring in a team of former associates to help them pull off the heist.The movie is really predictable and the story and character development pretty routine but the action scenes are amazing. The film does drag a little in the middle, during the overlong heist setup part of the film but for the most part it's really fast paced and thrilling. The stunts are some of the best ever performed (probably) and the amount of sheer destruction in the film is astonishing. There are several scenes that seriously push the realm of logic and reality but it's all in good senseless fun. The Rock makes a cool addition to the series and the fight scene between him and Diesel doesn't disappoint. The film is most likely everything you think it's going to be and it delivers exactly what it promises. In that sense it's definitely a success and in my opinion at least a little better than all the others in the franchise (just adding the Rock makes it that much better).Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_pFXcDSfo",Hellmant,"Apr 30, 2011"

No rating,Noisy entertainment even though it could have done with being tighter and more urgent than it was,"Very early in this film Paul Walker's character is hanging off the side of a speeding train in urgent need to get off before it hits the bridge. Instead of jumping to the ground and hoping he can roll his speed down, he jumps to a speeding car seconds before an explosion and then goes with that car as it flies off a cliff into a several hundred meter drop into a lake. At this point my girlfriend asked how any of that had been easier than just jumping onto the ground considering that hitting water from that height is similar to hitting concrete. I couldn't argue her logic but I did have to explain that her logic and attention to detail have no place in a film franchise that has hit its fifth instalment without ever suggestion that logic or plotting are anywhere near as important as a shot of a young woman's ass and a love of fast cars.And that is the problem with Fast Five that you need to overcome, it will at no point do much with the plot unless it knows it can get from that bit of plotting to the next car, gun or ass scene with minimal effort. It is a summer movie though and the ""Five"" in the title does mean that you should know what you're coming to with it. So I did my best to overlook the plot which is messy and a lacking logic at pretty much every turn – I over look it because I'm happy to surrender logic if the film can give me thrills and action. Mostly the film does, or at least it gives spectacle. Whether it is the foot escape over favela roofs or the ridiculous destruction derby of the robbery itself, the film provides you with a lot to look at and as such it is entertaining as spectacle. Personally I though the whole film could have greatly benefited from being tighter outside of these scenes and needed an injection of actual danger and tension. Instead everything happens and our characters and their cars seem indestructible, which does rather detract from the action because the viewer doesn't really ""care"" or worry about what is going on – it is all about just the spectacle. Although, like I said, it does do this well.Previous films in this series have had terrible effects and some awful CGI cars (that look CGI). I'm sure computer effects were in use here but mostly it doesn't show – specifically the car chases and scenes of destruction are satisfyingly real; again they may be effects but they are very good if they are because you do have the satisfying feel of stunt men working hard in the real world – something so many effects-driven blockbusters forget about now that computers can do so much. Matching the spectacle the cast mostly do what they are required to do by looking great. Paul Walker remains good-looking and has the sparkle in his eye that makes him fun to watch in these film. Alongside him Vin Diesel looks like he is half asleep in the most part and in this film his presence is massively damaged by having to be compared to The Rock. The Rock may not have much to do but he has great presence and a real brutal charm – arms the size of tree-trunks also help his ""character"" but, like I said, it makes Diesel look dull and out-of-shape by comparison (although the dull one is certainly true). Outside of them Brewster is OK despite having little to do, Tyrese brings his mouth but not the homoerotic comedy that he brought to the second film while both Pataky and Gadot have tremendous figures. Ludicrous, Kang and others in the gang appear to be in for fans of the franchise but it gives too many characters to care about – in terms of excitement and making the film tighter, it would have been better with a smaller group and tighter focus.Overall Fast Five is a fun film in a franchise that has seen some poor ones already. It provides spectacle and noise which is all one can ask for – even if I would have loved it to be tighter, more dramatic.",bob the moo,"Sep 21, 2011"
7,Entertainment: Ego Driven Car Races,"Ten years after the inception of the fast car action film phenomenon, Fast Five takes the U.S. box office by storm beginning summer early this year. Director Justin Lin (""Anapolis"") achieves an opening box office numbers north of 80 mil by amassing all of the franchise's most badass stars including Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Sung Kang, Matt Schulze along with adding the brute power of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. As expected, there is no plot or character development what so ever, immediately throwing the audience into the escape of Dominic ""Dom"" Toretto (Diesel) sentenced to twenty-five years in prison, facilitated by ex-cop Brian O'Connor (Walker) and Mia Toretto (Brewster). Following Dom's escape, Brian and Mia seek the help of an old friend, Vincent (Schulze), in Rio de Janeiro undertaking a job to steal three cars from a moving train as they wait for Dom's arrival. The heist goes amiss, however, they learn two things, first, they cannot trust anyone and second this is just the tip of the iceberg of the ticket to their freedom. Dom, Brian and Mia commence the biggest robbery the series has ever seen with a 100 million dollar target from the most corrupt and powerful man in Rio, Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). Needless to say, they call Roman Pearce (Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Han (Sung Kang) among other franchise favorites to evade the clutches of Reyes and U.S. federal agent Luke Hobbs (Johnson).Not many sequels stand up to their first installments, however, after four semi-entertaining sexy action thrillers struggling to create a worthwhile plot, ""Fast Five"" does more than equivocating its predecessors. The film's over the top ridiculous scope leaves very little room for slow boring moments. Instead it is full of pointless action scenes including a five-minute foreseeable faceoff between Diesel and Johnson. The battle of the brawny is accompanied by the battle of the sexy between Jordana Brewster and newcomer Elsa Patakay (local Rio cop Elema Neves). And yes there are ego driven car races.The same reasons that make ""Fast Five"" better than its predecessors make the film the true mess that it is. A completely flawed grandiose plot combined with ridiculously bad acting and Tyrese Gibson's cliché one-liners and Johnson's childish clever phrases such as ""Now give me the veggies"" make the script seem like something a 13 year old thought up while playing Need For Speed with his friends. However, by disregarding plot development and clever writing, ""Fast Five"" has broken through the bonds that have always been holding the series back.In the end, nothing stands in the films way as the writers completely shirk their job letting the cast loose through a labyrinth of explosive fun. All that matters is that ""Fast Five"" is the epitome of a Hollywood moneymaker. It is entertainment.",jonnyhavey,"May 3, 2011"

Exhilarating as well too!",UniqueParticle,"Jan 26, 2020"
7,"Fast, fun and mindless fury ... once again","I went into this movie expecting the usual; fast cars and hot babes held together with a more than flimsy action-packed story line and Justin Lin seemed to schizophrenically deliver (or did he?). The movie starts with a famously stolen and instantly aggravating ""one last job"" scene, obviously not something any movie goer can believe in this instance because let's face it who finishes a movie series on its fifth? This movie sees the return of all the usual (and previous) F&F characters and same tricks of the trade we have seen Brian and Dom perfect with all the usual so-called tense last minute escapes Hollywood has rinsed dry, yet still this movie does deserve its 7/10 rating.How? Rio and the favelas are beautifully shot, the new characters are refreshing and VERY well casted, the vehicles are awesome, although lacking in their usual ""bling"" quality and the witty humour running through from previous F&F's is a little bonus for fans of the previous movies. Coupled with a sprinkling of nail biting moments and generous helpings of laugh-out-loud moments this testosterone injected movie is no doubt a fun, easy on the mind movie to go and watch.Unfortunately, like all ""fun and easy on the mind"" movies, the simplicity of it all becomes very predictable and the same is true for this movie. The story line, although containing a couple of very interesting screws, is essentially like any other heist movie we've all seen before (you already know the conclusion and you always wonder where they magically get all that military level kit from). The fight scenes have obvious outcomes, the alliances of certain characters are openly questionable and the character of Matt Schulze (Vince) is more pointless than jet skiing in your 15 meter, back garden swimming pool.The UNENDING swarms of mind-blowingly beautiful women and roaring hot cars are haplessly missing in the trial to create a more interesting storyline, which has only lead to needless additions into the story which add nothing to the overall plot. This movie is like a man in his late 20's desperate to become something more yet hold onto his youth and ending up messing up on both fronts. There's a token nitrous moment amidst the scores of needless carnage and overflowing testosterone levels from the tanking cast and developments in Brian and Mia's relationship add nothing to the story.Overall, the movie is enjoyable but lacks the zing of maybe the first two. It falls short of a modern day epic man-movie like the ""expendables"" and clearly lacks the strong storyline and acting prowess of a brilliant modern day heist movie like ""the bank job"". Saying that, it would still be a shame to miss this movie.",deathiscoming-1,"Apr 30, 2011"

Even the cheesy lines and plot twists become enjoyable.Not sure I'd pay a full adult weekend cinema price to see it, but if you can get 241 or a student discount, definitely see it on the big screen!

7,Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Fast Five,"The latest in the Fast and Furious franchise has recently hit the screens and what with the others being a good way to spend a few hours I was hoping for a similar type of movie from this one with plenty of great cars and car chases to boot.Set after Fast & Furious (No. 4) but before The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (No. 3), this time the action is played out in Rio, Brazil after Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) has escaped from police custody in the US with help from his old pal Brian (Paul Walker) and sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) and gone into hiding. With them needing money to disappear forever, Dom hatches a plan to steal all the money from Rio's most reputable underworld kingpin Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida).At the same time they are being hunted down by the elite federal agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and his team who are trying to capture and take him back to prison. Although it is quite possible to watch this movie without seeing the previous 4 there will be some parts that may slip you by as the writers have assumed that, if your coming to see this movie then there is a very strong possibility you have seen at least a couple of the prequels/sequel.One thing that I was quite surprised about was the lack of actual cars in the storyline. Sure they were involved slightly more than a normal action movie but I was expecting a lot more. There were probably only 2/3 scenes involving racing or car stunts and when the whole movie is supposed to be based around cars I was expecting just that little bit more. If fact in one scene just when you are expecting a good old fashioned drag race, they cut away to reveal the car back in the garage and already won! The action does make up for this though and is fast flowing throughout as they jump from one explosion/fight scene to the next. The casting of Johnson as the bad-ass agent was a stroke of genius with him bringing his former WWE smack talk to the character. He really makes you want to hate him and I especially enjoyed the Johnson Vs. Diesel fight scene as the 2 heavyweights traded blows.At over 2 hours this is by far the longest in the franchise and although in general the time will pass quickly, they could have easily chopped off a few minutes here and there to stop the risk of it dragging for some people. The acting and script is nothing special and you will have to sit through a fair bit of 'we're doing this for family' talk but that is not what people will come to watch this movie for.With Neal H. Moritz announcing in March the development of a sixth and seventh movie for the series it is doubtful that this surprisingly long lasting franchise will go away quietly. Despite having lots of good action and successfully filling a void in my day, lets just hope that they return to the core basics for the next one rather than forgetting the main reason for these movies was supposed to be the cars.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",iReviewFilms,"Apr 29, 2011"
3,"Poorly made-up fiction, mocky action.","This one was too much even for the F&F franchise; I would call McGuiver and Jammy Bond, maybe even Braddock. And many places didn't look like Brazil, which has almost no passenger railways at all (maybe there're three or four, no more than 200 miles I guess), what to say TGV (or something looking like it, I really can't figure what was that). Second, it was more like Mexico, if I know something about that. Finally, I don't know where they found so many import cars for those do exist in very, very limited quantity. And just a dozen (in the entire country) are designated as patrol units, for use of senior officers who aren't seen around driving them. Well, there's no fun in driving a VW Fox or a Fiat with 79HPs, uh?",dueda,"May 10, 2011"
No rating,"Cliché, stupid stunt, cliché, bad joke, cliché, bad acting...","Why does this movie have a 7.4 rating??? Have people lost their taste in movies? I don't understand it. I don't even know where to start. This movie had every single cliché possible plus the jokes were insulting to one's intelligence. The acting was just bad. The stunts were ridiculous. Nothing made sense (this should be a science fiction movie, since none of those stunts could ever happen given simple laws of physics). Yeah, the stunts also insulted my intelligence. I was left speechless...and for 2 hours. The car chases were plain boring. The shooting and fighting scenes where the good guys kill 100 bad guys, and the good guys don't even get a scratch from being shot at with automatic machine guns, were a big yawn. And there was a looong fight scene where people get thrown through glass and walls and they break each other's faces and then when they are shown 1 second later they don't have one scratch!!! That's representative of how much effort was put into this movie!",rammvier,"Oct 7, 2011"

10,Best F'n'F yet,"After varying degrees of success with the franchise, My faith that ""Fast 5"" could deliver on the hype was waning somewhat. However I am pleased to say the series has redeemed itself. Fast 5 pulls out all the stops this time around. It delivers on action, cars, quality acting and a decent storyline. It explores the character personalities showing more humor, fear, vulnerability and determination this time around which gives the movie strength and depth that was missing from previous Fast n Furious movies. I found myself laughing out loud a few times at the subtle humor, and leaning forward for the action scenes which are truly amazing.The Story is not predictable and will keep the surprises coming to the end. The Cast has matured and it shows in the quality of acting over previous F'n'F movies.Pros:Good pace throughout the movieDecent storyline and plotGood Cast of actors/ actressesImaginative and inventive elements throughoutPlenty of ""Wow"" momentsCons: Would be nice to have more screen time for the carsa couple of cheesy moments ( but this adds to the humor of the film)Overall: Highly recommended film, Just be sure to stay until the end of the credits!9.5/10",corey_dw,"Apr 19, 2011"
7,"Not a Five Star title, but definitely Fast","The producers / distributors / makers (call them what you may) behind this movie have decided to transition The Fast And The Furious Series of movies from a street racing franchise into an action / heist one with car chases at its helm instead of the notorious street races that governed most of the previous movies. Had I not watched any of the past movies, I would have certainly welcomed this move. But after seeing all four of them (in anticipation of this one), I believe that leaving out street racing from this movie was not a pretty good idea - there's just one race in this movie and that too, is a friendly sort of no stakes race. Although I can understand the studio's motives behind doing so, The Fast And The Furious series of films deserve at the least one race per film.Anyways, enough of the complaining already. Coming to the point, which is Fast Five, the movie is surely fast and equally furious. The fourth movie ended with Paul and Mia attempting to bust out Dom from prison with an animated escape shown in the end. The fifth movie begins just at that point with a live action escape sequence replacing the animated one at the end of the previous installment. After a job that goes awry, the trio are then on the run since they're wanted by two factions of people - the crew of a businessman Reyes and the team of a DSS agent Luke Hobbs. After running around for some time, they decide to pull one last job to buy out their freedom with fake passports and start life afresh. But with these two powerful men on their tails, it ain't gonna be that easy.Fast Five is more of an action movie and so, for it to work, there has to be action. And there is - plenty of it. Without spoiling most of it by describing it in detail, I'd say the high points of the movie are the train job at the start that goes awry and sets up the events of the movie, the trio's escape from both teams who get to them simultaneously over rooftops, a fight between Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and of course, the finale which is absolute madness. And perhaps all of the sequences have been shot without any use of CGI which is what makes the action even all the more exciting and brings back memories of the past era of action movies where all sequences were filmed rather than digitally created.The cinematography is top notch as well. Although there are a lot of cuts in action sequences, we still get some long continuous areal views of the action (long meaning lasting around 5 seconds or so) which helps understanding what's going on and where it all fits into the surroundings. This ensures you're with the action. Performances are decent and for a mostly wooden Paul Walker reprising his role as Brian O'Connor, you have a surprisingly flexible Dwayne Johnson playing Luke Hobbs - the new entry in the franchise. His character is exactly what he told it would be in the behind the scenes featurettes - strong, efficient at nabbing criminals and a worthy antagonist to Dominic Toretto and his team mates. I'd definitely want him to return in the next installment. And although this ain't a movie about characters, we get some dialogs which actually help us understand the characters a little better giving us some insight into their lives. Nothing deeply psychological - just a tinge of what's hidden beneath the surface. Nice.On the whole, Fast Five is solid entertainment provided you're willing to suspend your disbelief and forget the laws of physics. But then, we always do suspend our disbelief to some extent in movies - that's what they're for. And none of us really does remember the laws of physics so they're irrelevant for the most part. In which case, the movie comes highly recommended and even more so for an action movie buff. This is the definitive action movie of the year. And do stay for some time for a nice post credits surprise which unlike many meaningless sequences, is a critical post-credits scene that might set up the next installment in the series.Score: 7.0 / 10",KrazzyDJ,"May 8, 2011"
8,Adrenaline pumping hardcore popcorn action done right,"The weather is finally better, people are taking their clothes off all over the place and even though it is still spring time, summer movies are now officially kicking off and ladies and gentleman, we start this summer right with Fast Five. The Fast and Furious franchise is something of an acquired taste, a sort of guilty pleasure that hasn't really been shown the respect it has earned. It isn't known for any of the terms critics love to use when they complain about a movie, like intellectual dialogue, solid characterization or even anything remotely close to a thought provoking plot. No, what it excels in is another term that critics seem to have forgotten about. Popcorn, no that overpriced buttery stuff you get from a concession stand, I'm talking popcorn films! Energetic movies meant to entertain, a good solid waste of time! So what makes a good popcorn film? Well if this question is asked to the future filmmakers of tomorrow one need only to watch Fast Five to see a fine example of how to get it right. Director Justin Lin (who also directed the fast and the furious) makes a huge leap in directorial prowess by showing an incredible eye for action that every other director today should take note at. The man can film ACTION, and you know..In an action moviethat's kind of what you want and with that eye brings together an expendables version of the fast and furious franchise starring everyone's favorite fast and furious stars. Dominic Toretto (played by Vin Diesel) and his crew find themselves on the wrong side of the law once again as they try to deal with a drug lord and a federal agent that's hot on their trail. So , umback to talking about the action. It is INNNNcredible. Oh man this is my kind of action, I seriously have not seen this kind of solid , non computer generated action in a very very long time and Justin Lins camera work is top notch. Every shot is deliberate and clean. Ohso good. Aside from the action the other thing that makes this film work is the stars. Everyone from The Rock to Ludicrous play their characters great and have their own moments to shine. While the movie does slow down in the middle to what looks like Ocean's Eleven meets Fast and Furious, the stars are what keep this movie was falling apart. The movie at times felt like a parody of action films, filled with cheesy cliché's that are sometimes so subtle you'll miss it but Linn will toss another scene in there in case you did and often in hilarious ways . The rock is just so great, it's these roles he should be taking, not the flying fairy kind, he's so great in this film I would love to see a spin off with this very character of his, this cocky nonsense guy who just knows everything, and he really does know everything. Frankly, that's the only two things that this movie has going for it. Action and pretty people and in a popcorn film, that's all you need. So this one is easy folks, for those with their noses in the air looking for only citizen Kane caliber films to entertain them, you should know better, you know a fast and furious movie isn't for you. It's a vapid film that would have been unwatchable had it not been for its action and star power. But it pulls off being entertaining. So if you're looking for adrenaline pumping action , seat rumbling roars of the hottest cars , beautiful people looking beautiful even when being shot at then you got yourself the definition of a popcorn film, meant to entertain you in every single way and this is popcorn done right.",FuryoftheFilmFan,"Apr 30, 2011"

7,Best of the series; A fun and clever action flick,"At the end of Fast and Furious Four, Vin Diesel's character Dominic Toretto is sentenced to twenty five years in jail while Brian (Paul Walker) and Mia (Jordana Brewster) run down the prison bus to break him out. In this fifth installment, the trio lands in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil where they continue running into trouble. In order to be truly free, they attempt to pull off a $100 million heist by assembling a team consisting of characters from the previous ""Fast"" installments. Their mission rips through Brazil while federal agent, newcomer, Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and crime lord, Hernan Reyes chase them the entire action-packed time.
The Fast and Furious franchise has never been known for heavy emotional and dramatic Oscar-nominated filmmaking. This time around, the no-nonsense, action themed, series with fast cars and wild stunts continues; with a bit of an Oceans 11 style heist thrown in the mix. Each character is an integral part of the team in order for the plan to work. Family is a common theme and the actors play their roles well, making the relationships believable. The 130 minute runtime doesn't seem sluggish or boring, particularly the dramatic ending involving a giant safe wrecking most of downtown Rio. Fast Five continues giving audiences exactly what you'd expect from the ""what you see is what you get"" series; tons of action, edge of your seat explosions, and of course, fast cars. Those looking for a fun and clever popcorn action flick will enjoy Fast Five with friends. 7.2/10",Drew_mania3000,"Mar 2, 2020"
9,A Nutshell Review: Fast Five,"As far as franchise films go, The Fast and Furious series seem to be hitting the ground at top gear, with this installment not showing signs of slowing down, but prepping a new direction for future films to take, shifting gears from a film showcasing hot bodies (not solely just car chassis) and fast nox-enabled cars into the classic heist genre, given that it had that as its underlying premise from the first film, and now with a growing ensemble, are ready to give Ocean's Eleven a run for its money.Rio De Janeiro provides the backdrop in which this installment takes place in (quite a popular location for films recently too), with the chief villain being Reyes (Joaquim de Almedia), a mobster with a businessman front, with his tentacles of vice and influence extending toward every part of the city. Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and the former's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) hide out in the city as fugitives having broken Dom en route to prison at the end of Fast and Furious, and with the kind of money available for the taking to start a family of their own with Mia found to be pregnant, they decide to assemble a team, not to pass up the opportunity of robbing Reyes blind.So in comes a whole host of characters whom we have seen in past films, such as Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Gisele (Gal Gadot), and even Han (Sung Kang) whom we know what happened to in Tokyo Drift, hence putting the chronology of the films at 1, 2, 4, 5 and 3, which is now sometime in the not so immediate future. Director Justin Lin takes on his 3rd film of the franchise and together with writer Chris Morgan have managed to introduce new elements to surprise audiences and fans up until this installment, keeping with the usual action laden elements, while bringing on new characters into the franchise, this time with Dwayne Johnson coming in as a no nonsense, dogged and persistent FBI operative Hobbs, with an arsenal of technology and attitude to aid him and his team in tracking down Dom and his crew.And of course who cannot wait to see two tough guys in Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson go one on one with each other in a fisticuffs, especially since their time with family friendly films have taken a backseat to put them both firmly back into the action genre. It sets up new rivalry, while keeping the old between Dominic and Brian with the latter always keen to prove who's the better driver. And like most ensemble films, it's make or break given the character's appeal, and I'm glad to note they share this incredibly chemistry this bunch of highly skilled cons who each bring their know-how to the table in trying to pull off mission frickin' insanity, and everyone possessing a mean driver's license to power souped up vehicles.And if it's action you're seeking, it's action you'll get in this film too, putting aside the rather rote and superficial theme of family and trust. There's no lack of races and wheels on the roads although I do note that there's not too much of signature cars to go around this time. Even a would be street race was unceremoniously cut off, although we do get it compensated with a four way race down two traffic lights amongst Roman, Dom, Brian and Han which was more of a fair competition since they were all essentially driving the same model. Then there's the big bang finale that you would have seen in the trailer, with Dom and Brian yanking a bank vault and travelling down the streets of Rio at top speed, in what would be a fittingly noisy last act destroying everything, and I mean everything, along their path, that has to be seen in a cinema to enjoy this guilt trip in sense surround glory. Needless to say I am a fan of the franchise, and am excited about the direction this film would be going even if it would mean limiting the number of cars on the roads, since the film had already shown the potential of that chemistry between the cast and characters, and I'm eagerly anticipating more. From one fanboy and an action junkie to any other, this of course would be recommended fare. Stay tuned while the end credits roll, and you'll be treated to a stinger that reaffirms and teases what's to come in the next film, with no less than two surprise appearances. But no, with the timeline, it'll take a while before Lucas Black will be able to link up with the guys. For an adrenalin pumping high octane entertaining film outing, Fast Five is that opener to a very noisy and crowded summer season to come.",DICK STEEL,"May 2, 2011"
7,The Rock Cooks,"The Fast and Furious franchise is one that is mixed in quality, while never dipping too far into being a bad film. Fast Five is one of the better films in the franchise and Dwayne Johnson is definitely the reason for that. While the story starts to feel like too much of the same thing, The Rock comes in as the power house Hobbs to counter Vin Diesel's Toretto. The dynamic between the two action stars creates a rivalry of entertainment. The on-screen chemistry between the entire cast cannot be denied and it is a joy to watch them play off each other, as family. With great effects and captivating stunts, this is a highpoint for these films and has me along for the long ride now.",Ltufano23,"Oct 16, 2023"
1,Lacks the Credibility of a Road Runner-Coyote Cartoon,"Okay, you chase down a speeding train in a rickety tractor rig, bumping along on desert terrain. You pull up to the speeding train, matching its exact speed, as you deftly cut the entire side of the box car with a blow torch. You hop in and deftly park a Ford GT onto the tractor rig not once, but twice. Then you drive a Corvette Stingray off the speeding train; the car crashing 15 feet onto the bumpy desert terrain off a speeding train and it causes no more damage than a small pothole. You speed the Corvette down bumpy desert terrain and are headed straight for the steel girder of a bridge spanning a 500 ft. deep gorge as a guy jumps off a train onto the car at the last split second.The girder apparently moved out of the way. You jump from the car as it hurtles downward off the cliff towards the water; a much longer plunge than from the Golden Gate Bridge and you pop up from the water, unscathed, as if you had just dove into a pool. You're then strung up suspended by chains in a warehouse but simply snap out of the chains just before the bad guys torture you and escape....All this happens after a speeding prison bus collides with a black Accura sports car..and the car wins! The car is undamaged as the bus rolls a dozen times and lands upside down with none of the handcuffed prisoners having been killed...and did the Rock take acting lessons from OJ?...This film is unconscionable garbage and is not worth watching.",qormi,"Feb 14, 2012"
No rating,One of the Best Action Films in a Decade,"Fast Five (2011)*** 1/2 (out of 4) Brian (Paul Walker) and Mia (Jordana Brewster) help Dominic (Vin Diesel) avoid his prison term and the three head to Rio where they plan on stealing over a hundred million dollars from a drug lord. Soon they have his men trying to track them down as well as a Special Units Force led by Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson). FAST FIVE contains some of the dumbest action scenes in the history of cinema but it doesn't really matter because they also show some of the greatest imagination you're ever going to witness and the most important thing is that they're incredibly fun. There are three different sequences in this film that contains action scenes so wild that your brain is telling you that everything you're seeing is impossible but there's something else telling you that it doesn't matter because they're simply so much fun. The fifth film in the series is without question the best and it's certainly a much needed improvement over the last two episodes. This film here pretty much seems like a steroid rage because of the non-stop action that is constantly challenging itself to come up with new ways to show destruction. It should go without saying but by this time the characters are all well-known and liked by the viewer. Both Walker and Diesel are at the top of their game as both have no trouble bringing these characters to life. Brewster, Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous also have no problem in their supporting roles. Johnson adds a lot of testosterone as he helps pump up the action. With Johnson and Diesel in the same film you expect some sort of big fight between the two and we're not disappointed. It should go without saying but the greatest thing here are the action scenes including an amazing start with a train robbery and then a finale involving a bank vault, which is just incredible to watch. The amount of imagination in these scenes is something the series needed as they just brought back all sorts of great action. Whereas previous films settled with stylish car chases, this one here delivers them as well as so much more.",Michael_Elliott,"May 23, 2013"
7,Above the standards.,"Fast & Furious 5 delivers action on a grander scale compared to its predecessors. As the team devises heist plans, the colorful atmosphere of Rio de Janeiro adds visual richness. Action sequences and car races remain thrilling, deepening the dynamics between characters.However, at times, the plot can become overly complex, and some characters' motivations could have been better explored. The film's runtime might feel lengthy, with certain scenes appearing unnecessarily prolonged. Moreover, instances where the laws of physics are stretched make the realism waver.In conclusion, ""Fast & Furious 5"" stands out as a chapter that caters to action enthusiasts within the series. With its large-scale scenes and character dynamics, it offers an engaging experience while showcasing some shortcomings in the plot and logic.",uhudsavascisi,"Aug 18, 2023"
10,The BEST of the franchise!,"I've been a personal fan of the F&F series ever since the very first title was released. Once I saw that Fast Five was in production I immediately began hunting down a pass for its first showing, I was successful. Fast Five is everything we all love about the franchise, fast cars, beautiful women, and of course some nail biting action scenes.Whether you're a long time fan of the movies, or a brand new viewer, this movie is a must see, you're guaranteed to get your moneys worth on this title.Best movie I have seen in a long time, it even managed to remove the bad taste that was left in my mouth by Tokyo Drift.

7,"Scale, size and speed all cranked up to the benefit of ""Fast Five""","The acceleration period of the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise is officially over. Now it's all pure speed. ""Fast Five"" pretty much blows the roof off of all previously held notions of what these movies are and could be. The action, the stunts, the cast — everything is bigger. With director Justin Lin and writer Chris Morgan returning from ""Fast & Furious,"" the creative sensibilities are all the same, so clearly the $40 million in additional budget had a big role to play in the finished product.Audiences handsomely rewarded ""Fast & Furious"" at the box office; in ""Fast Five,"" they reap the benefits. Never before have so many cars, trucks and trains been pulverized into scrap metal on the big screen. The stunts are simply huge. (I'd say grandiose, but this is the ""Fast & Furious"" franchises after all.) Morgan and Lin get the green light to do whatever they can imagine. Even if what they dream up doesn't make sense, it's fun to watch.Other than financial freedom, Morgan in particular has a lot more freedom of story. The unusual circumstances of the franchise's beginnings (i.e. Vin Diesel turning down the second film) created a recovery period of sorts. ""Fast & Furious"" had to bring Diesel's Dominic Toretto and Paul Walker's Brian O'Conner back together and reenergize fans of the 2001 original; ""Fast Five"" had a blank canvas. The usual tropes of these movies have been minimized and some passed over completely. It's a much looser and more fun movie.Surprisingly, the entire movie takes place in Rio de Janeiro. O'Conner and Mia (Jordana Brewster) have fled there after breaking Dom out of federal custody by flipping a bus of prisoners on a desert highway. That's the film's quick open. Dom is in Rio as well, and they all meet back up to pull off a job that will keep them on their feet. Only the job (boosting cars off a moving train) doesn't go quite as planned, and they have irked another powerful drug lord named Reyes, who ""owns"" Rio. They've also caught the attention of the FBI, who's sent its best man-hunter, Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) to bring them in. Morgan can't quite free these movies of the criminal good guys vs. law officer bad guys dynamic. On the plus side, at least it's no longer about whether or not O'Conner is going to do his job or throw it all away to help Toretto and co. He's firmly on their team now. On the other hand, you can imagine that the same war of conscience might befall Johnson's Hobbs and the woman he's picked as his sidekick, Elena (Elsa Pataky).""Fast Five"" also brings back some old faces: ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" stars Tyrese as Roman Pierce and Ludicrous as Tej, as well as Matt Schulze, who played Vince in the original ""The Fast and the Furious."" Add Sung Kang as Han from ""Tokyo Drift,"" and Gal Gadot, Tego Calderon and Don Omar from the last movie and you have a massive ensemble with which to play-act ""Ocean's Eleven."" That's essentially the model for this movie; all the characters have special talents and they're going to pull off a heist to take down the biggest boss-man in Rio. The characters also fit certain stereotyped roles, but that figures.Pretty much all criticisms of the plot and story mechanics become meaningless once Dom and O'Conner start speeding through the streets of Rio towing a gigantic safe in grand finale. The physics are questionable, but the movie stands out on the ingenuity of this action sequence alone, one that serves as an apt metaphor for this film series' reckless, bulldozing, couldn't-give-a-damn attitude. The ""Fast and Furious"" movies continue to ride comfortably in the seat of mediocrity, but they get to do it on the grandest stage yet in ""Fast Five,"" and that ratcheted-up entertainment factor helps sway this movie into more favorable territory.~Steven CThanks for reading!

7,Hard to rate,"I'm kinda done with this franchise, haven't seen a Fast movie since Fast 7.. But I was lucky enough to see the spinoff called Hobbs & Shaw for reasons I'm not able to explain and I heard they went into space in Fast 9 and it turned a lot of people off.. I will admit, when I saw Fast 5 on the big screen I had a blast. I honestly don't think I have ever had more fun in a movie theater. When looking back at it now, this was the beginning of the end. They went from street racing to pure action and I didn't see it coming, this movie had the element of surprise but anything made after this did not. They couldn't figure out how to top themselves to they decided to turn the characters into superheroes.. And apparently Dom has a psychopathic brother played by John Cena.. Never heard any references in previous movies and all of a sudden he's the new main villain.. I mean c'mon.. My 9 year old son can write better stories than that.This movie is arguably the most entertaining in the franchise but it truly was the beginning of the end, it spawned a bunch of sequels where dead characters were mysteriously brought back to life.. And flying cars into space. It's become pointless and stupid. I no longer feel emotionally attached to the characters. They should have ended it right here but sadly that's not the world we live in.",askeland89,"Dec 7, 2023"

There was a bit for everyone: good comedy, nice cars, very dynamic and full of action, thrill and last but not least very good acting from Vin, Dwayne and the others.All in all it was well worth the money, it was obviously the best from its franchise and I am really looking forward to the F&F 6.",marius-jugariu,"Apr 23, 2011"

But at the same time, they find themselves being pursued by a federal agent who's in Rio to arrest both Dom & Brian.Directed by Justin Lin, Fast Five presents the director in splendid form as his kinetic work behind the camera keeps its story running on top-gear from start to finish, and the earlier momentum it gained with its explosive opening sequence is never lost. The screenplay at last places more emphasis on its story & characters, adds in a welcome amount of humour and even though the route it takes is new, the old-school formula isn't entirely discarded.The technical aspects exhibit a complete overhaul which is in sync with the transformation this franchise itself undergoes through this chapter. Production design team puts up some wonderfully detailed set pieces, Cinematography makes exuberant use of its camera while the applied colour tones are more vivid than before. The plot unfolds at breakneck pace & Editing is at its best during the action sequences, and the vehicular carnage it has in store is simply overwhelming.Coming to the performances, Fast Five brings the notable characters from all the previous chapters together under one roof and all of them deliver more confident performances. Vin Diesel & Paul Walker show greater maturity in their respective roles of Dom & Brian but it's the swashbuckling input from Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson that turns out to be the biggest surprise of them all. It's not difficult to assess that he was really enjoying his character and it reflects in his impressive performance.Last but not the least is Brian Tyler's score which packs in some intense, vibrant tracks that never allows the film's charged atmosphere to settle down and actually enhances the whole experience by a considerable margin. The visual effects team also brings its A-game for the moments of action seem convincing for the most part, even if it's a tad over the top. There are more thrilling moments to be found here than in all previous chapters combined and all moments featuring Johnson & Diesel together are a highlight, right away.On an overall scale, Fast Five is without a shadow of a doubt the finest chapter in The Fast and the Furious franchise and the first one in the series that manages to find a near-perfect balance between its elements of style & substance. High-octane, full-throttled & immensely satisfying, Fast Five is an action-packed roller-coasted ride that packs in all the ingredients in just the right dosages to succeed as a genuine summer blockbuster material & a quality entertainer for not just the fans of the series, but newcomers as well. Absolutely worth your time & money.",CinemaClown,"Sep 4, 2015"

7,Fun Film For Fans of Fast & Furious Franchise,"Film series as of recent have been holding a better streak of adequate consistency than we might be accustomed to. Saw didn't start becoming rotten until the fourth installment and while the upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean film might not leave much of a strong impression, early reviews are indicating it'll likely be about as good as Dead Man's Chest (decent). Now we have the Fast and Furious franchise coming back with a fifth installment (and a sixth already in-development). Though the shameful 2 Fast 2 Furious might have been a poor addition, the remaining films have maintained an adequate level of execution and entertainment (peaking with the under-appreciated Tokyo Drift). And with Fast Five being the first of many guaranteed action blockbuster films for the summer, eyes have still been on it to deliver.What has to be made clear is that anyone who honestly wants to enjoy the film should leave their logic and standards at the concession stand. Because from the opening minute alone we're given a scene that defies all plausibility, and the things only continue down a similar road throughout. Now that this has been made clear, the skeptical shouldn't worry too much, for there's still a solid film to find here. Part of what helps Fast Five work as well as it does is thanks to the fact it embraces such an over-the-top nature that audiences are likely more willing to accept given the hardships of today's economy. If you've come to enjoy the crazy action characteristic of series such as Rambo and Die Hard, then you'll feel right at home here.Those who've followed the Fast and Furious films up to this point will probably get a fair amount of nostalgia throughout the film with various characters coming back, including a couple surprises not shown in trailers (one of whom audiences will want to stick around after the short credits, along with another curious surprise). As a result, long-time fans will get the most out of Fast Five. But this isn't to say that newcomers won't feel some sort of attachment (if not entirely to the characters). Since the return of various characters isn't relied on too heavily with regards to exposure, less-familiar viewers needn't worry about feeling lost or not getting an idea of what they're like throughout the runtime. Fast Five might not significantly raise the standards that we've come to expect from such a franchise, but it doesn't have to. With so many areas visited by previous installments, resorting to a more action/thriller-centered approach than even the previous film only seems like an inevitable and fitting road to travel. And you know what? The results are quite welcome and pleasing.P.S. Don't mind my alliteration-heavy summary.",Hellrazr360,"May 14, 2011"
10,The Fast & The Furious 5 ( Fast Fi5e ),"I've just got back from the showing of this Movie, and with high expectations I must say I was not disappointed! The Promotional work for the movie has been strong and with me personally being a big fan of the Fast & Furious Movies ( owning all dvds ) I Couldn't wait to see it! The cast are back... some old faces from the previous films return ( with some surprises in store too :) ) The Script is spot on and the banter with the characters keeps everyone laughing! The action is fast paced & I felt had a Jason Bourne Theme to it ( Opinions!? ) The amount of Cars in the movie was pretty high but it did stray from the Car Racing Scene but in my opinion it didn't let the film down... The Plot of the Movie was just-worthy & the characters had more depth to them, which was definitely lacking in the previous films!!AT over two hours long... this movie is definitely the best of the Franchise & is a must see for all fans but also for people who aren't so keen on the other movies because this one is a winner all round & with a planned sequel in the mix... One of the best movies this Year!!",whitt86,"Apr 22, 2011"

This movie was really just about Vin Diesel vs Rock, that's all. Without those 2 guys, this movie would've just sucked. In my opinion, this was NOT the BEST of fast and furious, the best is still Tokyo drift.Though most of the population just needs some violence and action to call it a good movie. Whether you want to admit or not, the fighting scenes were fake. Watching the movie, at the end, what lesson did you learn? Big guys with guns kick ass? Yay, when I grow up, I want to ride fast cars, steal money, and have a gang family and I'll still be the good guy. That's not how the real world works.Sure, they tried to add some elements from Ocean's 11 series with the Heist and everything, but that was most likely the only good part.",aiyush87,"Jul 13, 2011"

7,"Dumb, over the top and stretching every ounce of suspension of belief at times... but what did you expect from this franchise?","I will start with the overall statement to sum this film up within the franchise... Its the best of the five in my opinion.I could easily go to town on the film and reel off a list of elements that would be considered negative for this film, such as clichéd dialogue and outlandish scenes that ask you to suspend belief in reality to avoid finding more holes than a sieve.But why should i have to? This is what i would call a 'dumb summer blockbuster', a little slice of escapism and within a genre (action) that doesn't need to play it safe or play it to total reality. The dialogue will have you either grinning at the cheese of it all or putting your head in your hands at times, but if these meat headed characters had said it any more eloquently you wouldn't buy into the persona of who they are portraying. Dwayne Johnson's character of Hobbs is the stand out one, having all the best quotable lines and playing the super cop who is by the book to the bitter end as well as any you might have seen before. He is the rival to the untouchable anti hero character of Dom that Vin Deisel has growled for every film up to this point. You are meant to not hate Hobbs but at the same time i found an unintentional element of him having the funnier lines and being so over the top was that i was rooting for him over Dom and the gang at times! Now what i think must be noted is that when the franchise began it was simply a 'fast cars' film, very 2 dimensional but functional in its delivery. And while it didn't need 5 films in its run to have made it to the 5th film there was no way they could have flogged the same idea over and over and hope for the best. I applaud the thought process with the script to try and change settings and plot details, even though some of the films didn't work, and by raising the stakes in the jeopardy for the characters makes more sense as they seemingly try to top the last storyline. They have unfortunately by having this mini renaissance within the franchise not taken it as a good last hurrah to their story,going out on a high, and now think the franchise has new life to churn out another with the characters that dragged this film up from mediocre to fun entertainment. Had they stopped there they might have got away with it. While i cant predict the outcome of the 6th film, i do fear they will over emphasise the unintentionally successful parts of fast five and ruin both films in the process.But for now at least, an enjoyable 7/10",Generic_Gooner,"Jul 17, 2011"
10,Fast 5 - Awesome!!!,"Saw this last night. It felt like the whole film was taken back to the original storyline with the best parts from all of the others combined. Full of excitement, fantastic race scenes, fights, thrills, mystery and a good storyline to boot. Although I felt ""Suki"" was missing, they have picked the best of the whole list of characters and bought them all together in one film with a surprising good addition from ""The Rock"".At 1st I thought he might alter my perspective with his acting abilities but hats off to the man, he played his part well and added a crucially good character to the film, one to push Toretto to the limits.The whole production shouted ""here we are, this is the story as it was meant to be"" and not detracted as in the Tokyo Drift version, even though I actually enjoyed it for a film in it's own rights.there are, as always, parts of the film that have the imagination pushing believable limits but fuelled with the youth rush of excitement, you take it for what it is, enjoyable scenes with stretched reality that in all honesty, fits perfectly well within the story.The only criticism I would offer is one that leaves the average fan missing the end. As an Avid enthusiast, I saw the WHOLE film.",r-anderson-3,"Apr 22, 2011"
7,Gas Pedal to Full Throttle,"Race cars speeding along the street of Rio De Jainero, All Cast members come together all at once, the rooftop chasing and ultimate gun shooting, what more can you ask? Here it comes the fifth installment of ""The Fast and the Furious"" (2001) franchise, thiz is actually the bridging story between ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" (2006) and is a direct connection to the ending scenes of ""Fast & Furious"" (2009), when Dom (Vin Diesel) was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison and Brian's gang (Paul Walker) attempt to free him again. Justin Lin directs thiz sequel with identical pace and tone from previous movies. Just like the previous F & F movies, it's all about high speed car racing, hot sexy babes and some of cat and mouse criminal activities. Well, to tell you the truth, thiz time is more like a heist movie than car race movie. We will find very less of eye-catching race cars, the movie puts aside many glamour factors, to do otherwise they step on the gas pedal to full throttle into pure action. Frankly, I don't know for sure, who are the real ""Fast Five"" in thiz movie. Certainly, the focus is still on two central characters Dom and Brian. The rest are Dom's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster), the big mouth Roman (Tyrese Gibson), the high tech mechanic Tej (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges), the big muscle Vince (Matt Schulze), the beautiful driver Gal (Gisele Harabo) and the charismatic Sung Kang (Han Lue) from ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"". One thing for sure, there are more than five people. Thiz time they will face a well-matched opponent, the ambitious Federal Agent Luke Hobbs who is presented by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson! Thiz seems to be a great selection. The Rock delivers a strong and believable tough guy performance, I'm beginning to think thiz WWE's sensation could be a great serious Actor as well. On the other hand, Vin Diesel performs one round of WWE's wrestling scene with The Rock. It's pretty entertaining to see two giant muscles brutally clash with each other in bare hand fight. Thiz time it comes to my mind, if Vin Diesel would also be one hell of great wrestler in WWE's ring? With all the hype and enthusiasm around, thiz is clearly not the last F & F movie to be made, they will be back to do their things again. Thiz implicit confirmation is exposed in one of Hobb's famous lines, ""We'll find 'em, we take 'em as a team and we bring 'em back. And above all else, we don't ever, ever let them get into cars (again)"".Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",jonnyfendi,"Jun 15, 2011"
9,Fast Five (2011) - The Biggest Thrill in the Whole Series!,"The fifth installment of the hit ""Fast and the Furious"" franchise, ""Fast Five"", is bigger, better, thrilling, amazing, and it's so entertaining. This story is set in Rio de Janeiro, right after the events of the fourth movie, where Dominic Toretto, Mia Toretto, and Brian O' Connor teams up with everyone from the previous movies, to plan a $100,000,000 heist from the most powerful hit-man in all of Rio, without being caught by Agent Lucas Hobbs. The action is exhilarating, and it kept me on the edge of my seat, wanting for more. The plot is remarkable, and it has a heart of gold contained with drama and action. The cast of Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, ""Ludacris"", and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, who stole the show for his new performance as Agent Lucas Hobbs, was all quite spectacular, and they brought thrilling and heartwarming characters. Justin Lin was the perfect director to arrange such a movie like this, with all the action, the timing, and the energy. The cinematography and editing is super challenging and enjoying, and the script by Chris Morgan is a heart of gold. The directing is top-notch, the action is exhilarating, the cast is perfect, the plot is excellent, and the finale blends with a perfect notch of surprise. ""Fast Five"" is known as an epic, thrilling, funny, heartwarming, and excellent movie that I was entertained with all that high non-stop thrills and chills. ""Fast Five"", in my review, ""an exhilarating thrill ride, with a story to die for"".",nickmesafilms,"Oct 7, 2011"
6,Dumb and cheesy - But who cares?,"I can honestly not remember the last time I have seen this much testosterone on screen. Jesus. The plot is sketchy as hell and the pace is way too fast - you can hold a frame for more than a few seconds can't you? Furthermore all the men are constantly covered, and a lot of the time dripping of sweat. They are unsaved and rugged as hell. The women on the other hand are all 10's, though the poor souls seem to be suffering from anorexia and bulimia at the same time - and unlike the guys they are basically always clean and in full make-up. Basically every male teenagers dream. In fact I'd probably have loved it if I was 13. And you know what - despite all the ridiculousness and the extreme cheese factor it's actually quite fun.It's definitely a step down from the last flick, which actually managed to have a good plot and above passable acting - this seemed like an extreme rush job. ""Run over there, say your lines, and look cool - there will be NO retakes!!! - We need the money for special effects"" - is what I imagine must have been said quite often on this set. I'll give you one thing, it will make one heck of a video game - and damn did they manage to squeeze a lot into 130 mins - no clue why they cared to make it this long - but who cares.I can't really give it a bad rating. Despite a lot of poor acting, botched lines, a seemingly immortal henchman, and all that's mentioned above it actually managed to be really entertaining. Maybe it's my inner-thirteen year old that's talking but I give this movie 6/10.",Gloede_The_Saint,"May 6, 2011"
9,Best Fast and Furious yet,"Fast Five successfully revitalises the Fast and Furious franchise, maintaining the street racing roots whilst finally embracing and dialling up the insanity and complete disregard for the laws of physics to great effect. Beneath all the action and chaos, there's also a surprisingly vulnerable exploration of masculinity, linked directly to being part of a family.Vin Diesel is terrific, his performance as Dom works so well cause he takes it so seriously and grounds the film at the right level whilst letting everyone else have the fun. Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster are the heart of this film with an endearing relationship developing in heartwarming fashion.Dwayne Johnson really is the thing that invigorated this franchise at the right moment. A towering presence that commands the screen from the second he appears and its actually really nice to see a performance from him which is allowed to support for once rather than demanding all the attention.As its more of an ensemble this time around it leads to some create combinations, the best being Tyrece and Ludacris who are both so funny and work really well together. Joaquim de Almeida is unfortunately the odd one out with a really bland villain whose instantly forgettable (exacerbated by the villains that follow in 6&7).Justin Lin's direction is incredible. As the film mainly operates as a heist it moves along nicely and juggles its various characters really well and the third act is just a ridiculously entertaining extended sequence of carnage that's blockbuster cinema at its most unashamedly entertaining. The sheer amount of practical destruction is just immensely satisfying too.",masonsaul,"Jul 26, 2019"
7,Fun!,"'Fast Five', the fifth film in the The Fast and the Furious franchise, offers entertainment.

1,Total braindeath,"I saw this movie with expectations. The IMDb score were at the time 7.9, so I thought that this movie would be pretty good, but trust me, its not! What bothers me the most about this movie is the extreme stupidity and lack of logic. For example, in the beginning of the movie the team is raiding a train to steal cars located in the last carriage. A few carriages a head there are some police officers. They don't hear when the team uses blow torches to open the wall of the train carriage containing the cars resulting in the whole carriage wall ripping of, but when 1 shot is fired inside the carriage containing the cars, they suddenly get aware of the raid. Another example is when some characters are chased by police officers on some rooftops and vigorously time after time survives 30 feet jumps from rooftops down to the concrete street without a scratch. However, the most unrealistic and stupid scene is a car chase in the end of the movie. I wont spoil it for you but trust me, you will laugh or cry as all the laws of physic and logic are boldly defied.",DaXia,"May 7, 2011"

There has been an attempt to intentionally make every scene too tense and every dialogue a ""one liner"", which wasn't necessary.But, with the basic essence of the movie(the cars, the chases & great action) still retained, fans of the franchise will still love it.

7,"no longer a car movie, this is a slick heist flick","This sequel has basically moved away from the core of the first film which was about fast cars and slick driving into a pure seemingly impossible heist film. And I do have to say the way they pull of the whole vault theft was pretty good.The plot is Dom, Brain, and Mia are living in Rio de Janerio and on the run. It starts out with a pretty good action of them along with some other bad guys stealing cars out of a moving train. I don't think I believe that's possible, but it was still cool to watch. Any ways these guys there are working with work for the drug lord criminal of all of Rio, Reyes. They take this car that Reyes wanted and it turns out a chip was hidden in it that tells the locations of where Reyes hides his money.Mean while, the Rock plays a US agent hunting them down in Brazil. Dom decides to pull of the heists of all heist and sends for help, where we get some other characters from previous films. So, then we get to see if the plan works.BTW, the whole part of 2 cars pulling a very heavy fault down the street and racing was very silly. No way that is possible, but it was still entertaining.FINAL VERDICT: I like impossible heist movies, so I give it a positive recommendation.",MLDinTN,"Apr 9, 2012"

It's just sad because there are such little stupid things that could have been done differently to make this movie better.First of all...The acting is awful! I like Paul Walker a lot but how does he keep progressively getting worse as an actor? On top of that he's supposed to be growing up and becoming brothers/partners with Vin but the script has Paul fawning for his attention like a little girl.Remove Tyrese and Luda from the movie, get a REAL bad guy, improve upon Paul and Vins acting, Shorten the movie, more cars and less lame one - liners! I can't just blame the director or the actors for a bad script. Trying to write in actors to make the 2 biggest mistakes of the franchise make sense? NO! We just want to forget those movies and move on!This is basically what happens when a movie is rushed and put together poorly.

10,Fast5,"""The strength of Fast & Furious: even faster, and now FAST & FURIOUS 5 is that it is a very united group that lives following moral and ethical codes on one side or another of the law,"" explains the producer . ""Dom has a code, Brian has his own, and even this new character, Hobbs, played by Dwayne Johnson, has one. These codes create friction and conflict, increasing tension. It's great to see how sparks jump. "" Vin Diesel, speaking of the reaction of the followers, says: ""There are not many action films like ours that revolve around the family or, rather, a family of marginalized and misfits. We saw it in The Fast and the Furious and it happens the same in FAST & FURIOUS 5. The saga is based on a brotherhood that communicates something to the public. It symbolizes the family to which the viewer wants to belong because it will not abandon him, like Dom and his people. "" Followers made it clear that they were impatient to see another delivery. Paul Walker recalls Fast & Furious's enthusiasm: even faster: ""When we saw how successful he was, we knew there would be a fifth. Normally, the followers ask when the next one will come, but this time they did not ask, they affirmed it "".Adda Annotation Neal Moritz and Vin Diesel, who produce the film, were aware that the next installment had to overcome all of the above. They turned to director Justin Lin, whose work in the two previous installments proved that he could combine a story based on characters with insurmountable action scenes. He was the ideal person so that the spectators did not think that they had already seen it before.Add Annotation The filmmaker, a follower of the saga from the first installment, The Fast and the Furious, knew exactly what he wanted. The film had to be based on an impeccable casting with really amazing action scenes. ""There were still a lot of things left to discover,"" he says. ""I am very grateful to the study for not wanting to keep repeating the same thing over and over again. Thanks to this, the saga has been able to grow, evolve and mature. That's why I agreed to direct this new delivery. The basic theme of the saga is the family. The fourth installment explored the element of sacrifice that involves the family. As soon as I saw that the next one would deal with freedom and the family, I did not hesitate to return. "" He knew that if he directed his third installment, the expectations of the followers would be very high: ""The action in this film is greater than in the previous two together. There are about six action scenes, not just car chase, but also walk and steal. The film overflows action "". Although everything had to increase to satisfy the public, the action scenes would not make sense without the foundation of a good story, in which the heroes struggle to protect the family no matter what. Screenwriter Chris Morgan, another regular in the saga, joined Justin Lin to make sure the script reflected this vision. The preparation of FAST & FURIOUS 5 was at lightning speed. Chris Morgan, whose action-packed blockbuster scripts like Wanted / Se busca, Fast & Furious: even faster and A Todo gas: Tokio Race have earned him a well- deserved reputation as a scriptwriter specializing in action dramas, The work once more. ""For me, each new installment of the saga is an extension of the first,"" he says. ""It's always a privilege to go back to a story based on strong characters. This saga goes much beyond the races and the tuned cars, it speaks of a community, of a family of pilots "". Chris Morgan and Justin Lin have developed their own style in previous films. ""Having the beginning of the filming around the corner forced us to put the batteries,"" explains the writer. ""Justin and I attacked the story very differently, but when we started working together, I do not know what's going on, we always end up following the same path."" The idea of ​​reuniting more characters from previous films emerged during the pre-production of Fast & Furious: even faster, but since the plot was focused mainly on Dom, Brian and his companions, it was decided to leave this possibility aside. Neal Moritz says, ""When we saw the public reaction with Vin, Paul, Jordana and Michelle together again, we all thought the same thing: 'What if we met them all?'"" Vin Diesel was convinced that the tandem Dom-Brian could star in another chapter of the franchise: ""Of course, I wanted to continue with the story and I always thought of three stories, beginning with The Fast and the Furious, followed by Fast & Furious: even faster and now, FAST & FURIOUS 5 "". But one of the goals of this film was to bring together characters who had appeared in other chapters.

Written by Chris Morgan and Gary Scott Thompson and directed by Justin Lin, this is the third Fast and Furious movie starring Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster. Set in Rio De Janeiro, former FBI agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and his now friend Dominic Toretto ( Vin Diesel), facing 25 years to life in jail, are on the run from authorities and plotting a crime involving fast cars and a large sum of money. Brian's girlfriend (and Dom's sister, Mia, (Jordana Brewster)) helps in this caper. Fast Five opens with the bus rescue mission where Fast and Furious left off. The trio flee to Rio and are on track to complete their ""last job"" to make some good money and then disappear. The job goes sour when they discover a secret and realize they are up against a US federal agent (Dwayne Johnson) and his team and a Brazilian crime boss (Joaquim De Almeida).The movie is a fast paced action flick that is a great start to the 2011 summer season. At times silly and unbelievable, its predecessors were strictly race stories. This one veers off into more of a heist tale with secrets and fast cars. Dom and Brian are wanted for stealing cars from a Brazilian train and killing government agents (which they did not do). Characters from previous Fast and Furious movies appear such as Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris) and Han (Sung Kang). The newest character with the most impact is Agent Hobbs (Johnson), sent to Brazil to bring back Brian and Dom to the United States. Between Dom and Hobbs, it is the battle of the bulk. These two make a perfect conflict of brawn versus brawn. The Brazilian crime boss, Reyes (De Almeida), is out for Brian and Dom and an incredible chase scene ensues where Brian and Dom steal cars off a moving train. Is this realistic? Probably not. But who cares? It may not be realistic but it sure is entertaining to watch. This film is non-stop action. It's not only about cars, there are foot chases where Dom, Brian and Mia are attempting a getaway from Reyes and Hobbs. The buff Toretto and equally fit Hobbs duke it out in a classic fist fight and then of course there is the grand finale. Who would believe that a bank vault could be effectively ripped out of a wall and towed by two cars on a high speed chase through the streets of Brazil? This may sound silly, but somehow it works in this film. The action scenes are so intense and well set up, they are, for the most part believable.Much of the movie is spent setting up the heist. The characters are developed during this time. Roman (Gibson) is revealed as a loudmouth. Han (Kang) is reserved but his love interest in Gisele (Gal Gadot) reveals a more open side. Tej (Ludacris)comes out as the brains of the operation, by deciphering ways to access and open a military-grade vault. The film is 130 minutes and there is some fluff in the middle of the film but the chase scenes by car and on foot make it worth the wait. Mia is pregnant and sometimes you wonder how she can accomplish all this in her state. Somehow though, this is easily overlooked by her gutsy physicality. Where comedy was intended, the director missed the mark. There were a few instances where Roman (Gibson) provided much needed comic relief, but overall, besides the action and romance, the movie was a bit dry. This series of films has traditionally been geared towards young male viewers but with the new heist format, it becomes more attractive to female viewers as well. The physical build of Diesel and Johnson as well as the pregnancy and romance between Brian and Mia add an additional level that female viewers would enjoy. Even though the film is long and at times over the top, it delivers what fans of this genre are looking for.This film is no classic and there is a rather shallow storyline to follow. The script for Fast Five has improved over previous Fast and Furious series movies, yet it still lacks certain qualities of previous Fast and Furious movies. However, it still comes together well and makes a dynamic and memorable motion picture.",scaitke,"Sep 30, 2014"
10,my no1 film,This film made me. This has always been my favourite film probably because of the way they form the group it's iconic. The cast is just brilliant I can't imagine it was someone else and also the end seen my favourite thing. Danza Kuduro playing in the back chest it's amazing and I really feel like everyone should watch,miacoop,"Jan 11, 2021"
6,Justin Lin and Chris Morgan are just what the franchise needed,"This is the fifth movie in the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise. Fifth. You'd think the franchise would burn out by the third film and drift into direct-to-video territory like so many unfortunate film franchises today (here's looking at you, American Pie), but Fast Five sort of breaks the taboo and proves that, even at the fifth movie, it can still be entertaining and appealing as hell.Sure the acting and screenplay aren't exactly Oscar worthy, but for this genre it does the job great. Vin and Paul, along with many of the reunited cast of the franchise (Matt Schulze, Tyrese, Ludicrous, Sung Kang, Gal Gadot among others) make for a damn good action team, and the nostalgic value of seeing these different sequel's characters teaming up and joking around is one of the best aspects of the film. Oh, that and seeing Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel duke it out mano-e-mano, to see who is the better tough guy.Chris Morgan and Justin Lin are to take credit here. The first movie was solid, but light on acting and story. The second movie was just dumb. The third movie in which Lin and Morgan joined in, was a bit dull but still kept some interesting bits. The fourth movie reunited the original cast members but it felt a bit boring due to some story developments, but hey, you can't blame them for trying.This time around, however, Lin and Morgan improved a lot. Morgan tweaks with the sequel, transforming it into a heist film rather than the first and third films which focused on racing, and the second and fourth films which focused on getting a badder criminal. In this sequel the baddie is a corrupt politician/gang leader played by Joaquim de Almeida (Bucho from ""Desperado"") so you know he's going to be a really nasty villain. The characters are now quite fleshed out and interact more with each other, showing a more older and vulnerable side of them since the last time we saw them in previous films.Lin shows off his (improved) knack for action sequences. There are some really good stuff to be seen here, one of which involves a train and the other which involves the near-total destruction of the streets of Rio de Janeiro. What is impressive is that most, if not all of these action sequences are shot live-action as opposed to CGI (I never liked the climax involving CG tunnels in the fourth movie). While there are few racing scenes, the last action set-piece, is truly a sight to behold. It is preposterous, yet utterly exciting and hilarious to watch due to the truly amazing stunt work put together by Lin and crew. I've never seen destruction this frenzied and exciting since James Bond's pleasant tank drive in St. Petersburg in ""GoldenEye"".It has to be said anyway - this is the best of the franchise, hands down. Morgan and Lin took the franchise to a different and quite mature direction, and let's hope the sixth (yes, it was mentioned a week ago) will be as good, if not better, than this one. This is great entertainment and a solid start to the summer.P.S. Stay after the first part of the credits. Trust me.Overall rating: 73/100",dvc5159,"May 6, 2011"
1,"Fast, Furious and MORONIC!!!","I cannot think of a dumber film...just cannot! This film's plot, direction and acting are an insult to one's intelligence. I am all for action films, love them, but only if they can suspend my disbelief, in other words, take me into the film, get me involved, make me care about the characters and know everything I see is amazing but still possible.This piece of cinematic and dramatic garbage had people in the audience laughing, not with the movie, but LAUGHING AT IT! Laughing at the awful dialogue and the corny, clapped out scenarios and character types, and groaning at the drivel that tried to pass itself off as classy entertainment.Mabe the experts are right after all; the youth of today are getting dumber, maybe due to preoccupation with computer games...If all you want is; violence, devoid of realism and blood, car crashes and 'gee they missed them again with that shotgun at close range' then this is the film for you!

No rating,Mexican's where are you living?,"I watched the movie today, apart for some childish action and destroying of entire Mexico's capital with just 2 cars and 9 guys it makes one think that is Mexico a pathetic country where entire police force is unable to stop a single money heist? Tugging of a container with two cars and rampage the entire city is too much fantasy that anyone can laugh about it and say Mexican's please wake up and do something about your country otherwise you will be perished in this world. Reviews should be logical and not that it s a good movie or a bad one. Mr Vin Diesel is just pulling up the legacy of first movie. For a teenager it might be a good movie but after watching thousands of movies this looks quite sub standard and useless activity to watch a movie and waste money and time, where there are good movies that can be viewed.",MajorBaleegh,"Oct 6, 2011"

Plus, it seems to be a little more self-aware of how ridiculous it is, which I can appreciate. Although I still don't see how these movies have made so much money.",cricketbat,"Dec 28, 2018"

7,A return to form for the 'Fast & Furious' franchise,"Very well shot with some truly spectacular driving stunts and special effects; the driving in this film is really excellent; hats off to all those involved in the stunt work! As for performances, well everybody did a decent job; Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto and Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner, reprising roles from previous instalments were just as good as they were in the first film. Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto did a decent job, as did Dwayne Johnson as the no-nonsense cop, Luke Hobbs. Also worthy of note were; Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pearce, Ludicrous as Tej Parker, Matt Schulze as Vince and Joaquim de Almeida as Hernen Reyes.You'd have thought a film about big men driving fast cars wouldn't be all that appealing, but this one does have a bit of something about it. No, it's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it is entertaining in its own way and I can't knock it for that. The stunt work is excellent and the plot isn't all that bad as either. It does, however, require some knowledge of at least some of the previous films involving the main characters though. It works quite well as a caper/heist movie with a bit of an edge to it, although I did find a little too much time was spent with the 'good guys'. The city of Rio features very prominently and, for me, was also a bit of a star of the show. Over all, although it's not a great film, it's an entertaining film and one I have no problem in deeming Recommended.My Score: 7.2/10 IMDb Score: 7.3/10 (based on 105,098 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 78/100 (based on 180 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 83/100 (based on 104,318 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",ajs-10,"Mar 17, 2012"
10,Amazing,"I have loved these films ever since they first came out and when I saw that there was a fifth one I was so excited! I was hoping that it was going to be as amazing as the past ones, and it is. This newest film is actually one of the best and definitely worth watching. I am a girl and I love these movies. It's not because of Vin Diesel or Paul Walker - I love the cars and the action. These films never disappoint and certainly not this one. Without trying to ruin the film - there are a few shocks, but you will only understand them if you have seen the other films. I really advise anyone to go watch this film, you will not regret it! The action is as great as usual and the cars are still amazing too. The humour is still good, if better than usual.",nicole_ward,"Apr 23, 2011"
7,Quite a lot,"And I am not referring to the number of movies the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise has built up to now. I am talking about the actors involved in this. Which leads me to the conclusion that Justin Lin must have done quite a lot things right too. Not only does he return again and again to the franchise (it's his third time at the helm), but he brings back a lot of people you'll recognize from the previous movies.That of course means, that you might want to freshen up your memory and re-watch the previous movies. Yes even the ""Tokyo Drift"" one! A new face is Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson of course. And while he's not quite Tommy Lee Jones (as seen in ""The Fugitive""), he brings a lot to this movie! All the actors do not count of course, if the action isn't right. And you have some very nice set pieces here, very well choreographed. A real fun ride then. Of course you can tell that this won't be the last one (stay and watch until the end credits roll through to get a tag end/scene), so I do wonder, since the title get smaller and smaller, will they call the next one ""F-Six""? And then ""F7""?! But until then, enjoy the movies as much as you can :o) (just don't try it at home/on the streets yourself!)",kosmasp,"Dec 26, 2011"
9,Action Adventure Movie Worth Watching,"I'm not a movie critic. I know what I like. And this movie is, without a doubt, very well done. The action is top shelf, the pace is fast and unrelenting, the cars and women are stunning and there isn't a single character, even the villain, who is truly despicable. That is, everyone in the movie is likable and watchable.It was great to see Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) playing somewhat of a bad guy but he's also one of the good guys. Being a fan of Clear and Present Danger, I was a little disappointed that Joaquim de Almeida's role wasn't more prominent but it is, essentially, an ensemble cast that is fun to watch. Definitely a movie worth watching and there isn't much of a lull anywhere in the movie to allow for a quick run to the bathroom so make sure you're familiar with the pause button's location on your remote.",rockchester,"Dec 20, 2012"
6,One of the better films in the series.,"Finally a film from this series that's Fast and Furious all at once. Recently released on DVD and Blu-Ray this film brings together Paul Walker and Vin Diesel in the fifth film of the series. In addition to actors from the other films in the series this film also introduces Dwayne Johnson in a new role.The Fast and the Furious series is one that hasn't required a lot of attention to enjoy. The cars are cool and the action is great, the plots are generally weak but sufficient to embody the action people come to see. This film seems to be leveling off the quality of the story with the incredible action. The stunt work and special effects are the best by far of all the films.The story finds Brian O'Conner (Walker) and Dominic Toretto (Diesel) together again after Dominic escapes from prison with the help of his friends. this time they're in for one last score before they fade away into hiding. When the score goes bad they find themselves calling on their old friends to join them for revenge. They're up against a powerful and corrupt business man (Joaquim de Almeida) and a daring federal agent (Johnson). The action is great and the story is well done in this fifth film.Sure this isn't an Academy Award winner or anything, but it's a series that has grown up with this film. I would definitely crown this as the best film in the series. The acting is good and the soundtrack provides a great backdrop for the action. Still the star of the show is the action. It's visually exciting and filled with over-the-top action sequences. I would definitely recommend seeing this film if you've enjoyed the others. It's also great on its own since it only loosely relies on the previous films. I would give this a 3.1 out of 5 stars.",jeffro517-783-121956,"Oct 19, 2013"
1,What a steaming pile of crap!,"I just don't understand how people can give this anything above 3/10.

The acting is extremely poor as expected, many scenes are extremely cheesy and cliché. The stunts are so grossly unrealistic that it pisses me off that they even try and make us believe this sh*t is even remotely possible. It's just as realistic as having them fly around like superman and creating antimatter out of their asses.This whole movie is just dumb on too many levels and those who enjoyed it are equally dumb!

7,Fast Five Summary,"The movie Fast Five was a well made movie because it had a lot of action going on through out the movie, which gave the movie a good effect and really got the audience into it. All of the cars in the movie were really nice and very modern which is what got a lot of people to watch the movie. The engines of the cars gave the movie a good effect and it was almost like you were in the movie driving it. All the cars and racing was very intense. The actors were the best for the movie because they are tough and suit the personalities of the movie characters. For example, Dom one of the main characters was big strong and scary so it showed that the people that are racing the cars have to be tough and scary looking. Then they have Paul walker and he doesn't look like a racer but is and he worked his way into the family. Another thing I really liked about the Fast in the Furious movies in general are that a lot of the scenes are fast short scenes when the action is going on, but when there are slower scenes when everyone is calm and hanging out, the scenes get a little longer.So overall, I thought the movie Fast Five was a good movie and would watch it again.",mariokelly-34452,"Nov 1, 2015"
9,My favorite Fast & Furious movie!,"After Fast and Furious was released in 2009, it was announced that Universal Studios would release a fifth film titled Fast Five in 2011, but this time the films would depart from the underground street-racing theme of the previous films and transforms the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By doing so, they hoped to attract wider with car culture and cars being used as a heavy emphasis.The plot follows the events of the last film with Dominic being transported to Lompoc Prison, but eventually is saved by Brian O'Conner and his sister, Mia Toretto as they hid in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. They plan a heist to steal $100 million dollars from corrupt businessman Hernan Reyes while being pursued by arrest US Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs.To me, this was the film that transformed this franchise from the underground racing-theme in the previous film to movies that has cars and girls and stuff. This was also the first film that features only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as gun fights, brawls and the heist of $100 million.The action is top-notch with the climactic car chase at the end of the film, which is the best climax in an action / comedy film ever made and created and I give credit to the director and the script writer for doing this.The music by Brian Tyler is just memorable and I'm not going to go into too much detail about his musical score for this film because he's also composed music for the fourth and fifth films in the Final Destination series and he has just finished composing music for the upcoming sequel Avengers: Age of Ultron, which hits theaters worldwide next Friday on May 1st, 2015.Now, I get to the acting. Vin Diesel returns as Dominic Toretto and he is really good. The same can definitely be said for Paul Walker & Jordana Brewster as Brian O'Conner and Mia Toretto. Sung Kang and Gal Gadot as Han Seoul-Oh & Gisele Yashar were wonderfully, especially Gal Gadot, who will be playing Wonder Woman in the upcoming Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice, which is set for release in March of next year.The film sees the return of Matt Schulze as Vince and he does a great job in the screen time that he has until he dies in the film, which is a sad moment. The film would also see the return of Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges as Tej Parker and Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pearce and they do a very great job and the comedy is just funny and the way they talk is just funny and amazing.The film introduces three new characters: Hernan Reyes, the main villain, played by Joaquim de Almeida, who does a very good job, but it took me a couple of re-watches to understand what the heck was saying. The second character introduce is Elena Neves, Hobbs' partner and Dominic's second love interest, played by Chris Hemsworth's wife, Elsa Pataky. She is just cool. Finally, the third character who would be introduced was Luke Hobbs, played by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and he performs the role fantastically. The fight between Dominic and Hobbs was fantastic and Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson took that scene really seriously.Overall, I simply love Fast Five. It blends action with comedy so brilliantly and awesome. The drama also works and it is really great. I give it a 9 out of 10, this might be a little bit high, but it definitely works for me.",joshuadrake-91275,"Sep 23, 2015"
7,More action than anybody can possibly expect,"Following the previous installment, Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) breaks out her brother Dom (Vin Diesel) from the prison transport. They escape to Rio de Janeiro. Running low on cash, they do a job with Vince to steal cars from a train. However everything goes wrong. Three DEA agents are killed, and the three escapees get blamed. They find a chip in the car that shows where master criminal Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) has hidden his $100 million. Meanwhile DSS agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) has arrived to catch the three and bring them back to justice. He takes uncorrupted local cop Elena Neves (Elsa Pataky) as his translator. Instead of running away, the three decide to call in reinforcements to pull off the greatest robbery ever.Director Justin Lin is bringing more action than ever. The addition of big action star The Rock just raises the bar that much higher. It starts with a great car-train action scene. Then a foot chase in the barrios looks incredible. That's barely half of it. I do wish the story be simplified even more. Most people watch this for the action, not for the story. This is a movie that delivers the action and exceeds the expectations.",SnoopyStyle,"Feb 23, 2014"

8,Franchise Turning Point,"Featuring some of the most spectacular and jaw dropping action scenes I've ever seen in a film, this is the definition of action. This is how all the Fast and Furious movies should've been. It was after the first film that the series went downhill, with a poor second movie, an even worse third attempt, but the fourth was good enough setting the bar high enough, although director Justin Lin completely smashes that bar leaving it in the dust. He has totally breathed new life and full on excitement into the franchise. The main issue with the previous movies was the lack of breathtaking action, instead the creators settled on boring characters, corny emotional dialogue and not enough chaos, whereas this fifth movie just excels in everything, both in speed, drama and action. Stunning locations, gorgeous girls, earth-shattering fight sequences and a riveting story that completely knocks the first four films out the water, prepare for the ride of your life with Fast Five. The opening continues where the fourth film finished, and straight after comes the epic train sequence, then a rooftop chase across the maze of shanty town Rio, and thank god Diesel and The Rock fight it out. There are so many memorable scenes and awesome races that you will be spoilt for choice when it comes to trying to pick out your best moment. But, it has to be said, the finale is the one, which is fifteen minutes of action movie perfection with an exciting twist you definitely won't see coming. Must see! Must own! Fast Five is easily the highlight of 2011 for action.",JamesIan2021,"May 12, 2015"

There are some stunts that could be perceived as a bit far fetched, but I still loved it- I mean, I go to the movies to get away from reality for a couple hours, so whether it's a rom-com where the guy gets the girl every time no matter how much he messes up, or some unrealistic stunts in a drama/action, I don't care if it technically can't happen the way they do it on screen.

7,"The beginning, and end, of the genuinely good films in this franchise.","Fast Five rides the line between ridiculous and fun better than any other Fast movie. It's filmed pretty competently, with a lot more practical effects and interesting shots. The Rock is here to shake things up, and his entrance is most welcome. I've been disillusioned to his acting talents recently, but here he's firing on all cylinders with a role perfect for him.We also have a few returning characters, creating a well rounded roster overall and building upon the previous films. With this we also have a fresh and exciting location: Pseudo-Brazil.Now you still have to throw out any prior knowledge of physics to enjoy the film. Fast Five also requires any geopolitical facts to be purged in order to make a semblance of sense. After that, you're good.This film is absolutely the direction they needed to go. Then, they amped up the ridiculousness and created something worse, or better. Who's to say? All I know is that this one is my favourite.",H4wke,"Nov 6, 2024"

7,"Too Stupid, Too Fun","Some films can be so idiotic that an audience will become insulted by their ineptitude (see The Last Airbender or Sucker Punch). But some films can be so idiotic that an audience will start giggling at how ridiculous the whole thing can be. Thankfully, the fifth outing in the decade-old Fast and Furious franchise falls in the latter category as an enjoyable, popcorn-munching thrill ride.The film begins with where the last one left off: Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is carted off to jail but is busted en route to prison by his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) and her boyfriend / Dom's now friendly rival, Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker). After escaping the US, the trio find themselves in Brazil but end up pissing off the kingpin of the favelas in Rio, Hernan Reyes (Joaquin de Almeida). Even with a brutal DSS agent (The Rock) on their tail, the Torettos and O'Connor decide to get back at Reyes and pull off a heist with a cash winnings of $100 million. So they recruit nearly all their friends from the previous four movies (including Ludicrous, Tyrese Gibson, Don Omar, Sung Kang, Matt Schulze, Tego Calderon, Gal Gadot) to ban together and pull off an insane robbery plan.From this little plot summary, you can already tell this is really not the most serious action film out there. And thankfully, the actors and director do not take it so seriously either, that they start to have so much fun with what they have. It does seem that the film tries a little too hard to make you like your main characters even though they are all thieves. For instance, Dom is frequently portrayed as a church-going, fiercely loyal friend despite being able to wreck anybody that gets in his way. But it's par for the course and it allows to confidently root for him and his team, even when their villain is so cartoonishly evil that he can't be taken seriously. But as I said, seriousness is not the order of the day. Fun is all there is on the menu, and the actors are able to support that fun just the same. The dialogue is peppered with pretty silly lines for the three leads, but they each deliver them with such deadpan seriousness that you almost begin to wonder if they are intentionally trying to make you laugh. However, the dialogue does fall flat many times, and I was kind of hoping with such a ridiculous premise that dialogue could keep up with it. Sadly, that didn't happen. The middle of the film also drags on a bit with a notable lack of action, but this is made up with some funny exchanges between the characters who have some great chemistry.Meanwhile Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous have fun exchanges throughout the film, as do Don Omar and Tego Calderon. Gal Gadot and Matt Schulze don't add much to the mix, but they're fine with what they are given. I was really wishing to see more of Sung Kang as Han from Fast and Furious 3: Tokyo Drift (the ONLY good part about the movie), but even he delivers some fun lines as well. But no exchange was making my audience crack up more than watching The Rock and Vin Diesel trying to out-Man the other guy. Even more so when their big fist fight in the film disregards physics.Speaking of which, I'm pretty sure the director, Justin Lin, must really enjoy flicking off pictures of Isaac Newton, because physics do not exist in this world. In this film, he has two guys drive off a steep cliff into a river and somehow survive the impact of the fall and bare men can break through the walls of favelas. The film then leads to a spectacular sequence involving two cars dragging a large safe through the streets of Rio while using it as a wrecking ball against their pursuers. It gets so ridiculous that it achieves the Bad Boys 2 effect: a film that is so aware that it's dumb, that it becomes a fun ride for all. While Fast Five cannot be called a great film with hokey dialogue and some flat characters, it does manage to entertain its audiences with the cast having great chemistry and over-the-top stunts leading the way throughout the film. Give it a look if you have an afternoon free, and enjoy the ride.",TheDarkKnight21,"May 22, 2011"

6,Best one since the first!,I cant believe Im actullay saying this but they came out with a Fast and Furious sequel that I actually liked. No they did not improve on the acting but everything else is done much better. The dialouge and plot were much better this time around and the action scenes actually heart racing.This movie follows Dominic Toretto and his crew of street racers who plan a massive heist to buy their freedom while in the sights of a powerful Brazilian drug lord and a dangerous federal agent.This movie was actually a pleasant surprise. After all the other sequels I was really going to give up on this franchise and Im really glad I didn't and decided to watch this one.,deatman9,"Oct 21, 2012"

7,A Thrilling Evolution of the Franchise with Some Room for Improvement,"Fast Five marks a pivotal moment in the Fast & Furious franchise, shifting gears from street racing to high-stakes heist action, and it largely succeeds in reimagining the series' direction. The film brings together a star-studded ensemble, with Vin Diesel and Paul Walker reprising their roles, and introducing Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, whose presence adds a much-needed boost of energy and charisma to the team. The chemistry between the characters is strong, and the action sequences are as adrenaline-fueled as ever-especially the jaw-dropping heist at the heart of the plot.The film also benefits from a tighter, more focused narrative compared to some of its predecessors, as it moves away from the street-racing subculture and dives into heist territory. The set pieces are grand and well-executed, including the memorable scene where a massive vault is dragged through the streets of Rio. It's the kind of spectacle that makes Fast Five an undeniably fun ride for fans of action films.However, while the action is top-notch, the film's plot can feel a bit formulaic, and some of the character motivations are glossed over in favor of the spectacle. Certain elements-like the improbable stunts and the occasional cheesy dialogue-pull it back from being a truly great film. Additionally, while the ensemble cast is a strength, the sheer number of characters can sometimes dilute the emotional stakes of the story.Overall, Fast Five is a significant improvement over its predecessors, bringing a fresh dynamic to the franchise that pays off in terms of excitement and entertainment. While it's not without its flaws, it manages to be an engaging and fun ride that propels the Fast & Furious saga into new territory, setting the stage for even bigger and bolder adventures.",fahimrcs,"Jan 17, 2025"
1,Stupid five,"Right from the opening scene, this flick goes fast stupid and furiously nonsense. Throughout the whole torture (vin diesel escaping from police escort, stealing cars from moving train, dragging vault through crazy traffic etc etc), these guys so meticulously calculate the dynamics and impact of car dash, crash and chase that they should get call from NASA so that these folks can exactly pin point where exactly mars rovers gonna land on the alien planet. FBI's best guys looks like a pack of chasing wild dogs with their sense of direction fitted up their behind. They were supposed to be after FBI's most wanted nuts and should'v been able to close the chase soon instead the fast five guys managed to get a whole aircraft hanger for their plan simulation, they had whole lot of exotic cars for their dress rehearsal, they even managed to drag race stolen police cars across the street (I guess Brazil does not goes this numb even during world cup soccer), looks like lying low should read upside down from now. The whole climax scene is so damn ill conceived that it totally knocks the brain out , I can't even put in words how stupid the whole climax was, just watch it to believe. This movie does not feel worth even after I switch off my logical processing unit. Apparently fast five guys in their cars seems more secure than US president in his Air Force One.Aghasttttttttt...........",iamdbee-319-232845,"Mar 30, 2012"
No rating,Fast and a lot more furious.,"For anyone who thinks this ten year old franchise might be running out of fuel, have no fear because on the basis of Fast Five, it could run for another decade. This is the longest of the five films and in my opinion, it is the best.The film contains two of the best action scenes I have seen in the franchise. Fast Five is all that you'd expect and more. However, the cars and the girls aren't quite the major players they are in previous movies but they're there nonetheless, so don't be disappointed.Fast Five sees a buffed up Dom and a loved up Brian and Mia flee to Rio after they become fugitives of US law. There they decide to do one final heist and invite some old friends back to take part. This is no ordinary heist either and involves getting on the wrong side of some extremely dangerous people.The old faces are back with Roman and Tej but it is the comedic banter of the two new faces in the team - Don Omar and Tego Calderon - that I enjoyed the most. And Sung Kang and Gal Gadot aren't just making up the numbers. She has a figure to make your eyes pop out !! For me though, the cream of the movie is the much anticipated arrival of Dwayne Johnson as Federal Agent Hobbs. He is superb and I'd be surprised if he doesn't feature strongly in the next film. His role opposite Diesel works a treat and in my opinion, neither one outdoes the other.There is more effort at plot and character development in Fast Five than previous outings and some people may be surprised at how events unfold. It might not be for the best but we will have to wait and see.Rio is the perfect setting with the sun drenched streets and alleys of the favelas as well as the constant menace of the omnipotent local drugs lords. These guys are ruthless characters and very well armed, with a stranglehold over the local law enforcement agencies too.All in all, a welcome return for everyone concerned. Keep your eyes open during the credits for some extras that you won't want to miss. I'm already looking forward to the next film. I just can't think what title they'll come up with !!",MrJRGO,"May 5, 2011"
6,Totally different approach.,"""Fast Five,"" the fifth installment in the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, takes a sharp turn from its predecessors, emphasizing heist over high-speed chases, which might not sit well with all fans. Known for its adrenaline-pumping car scenes, this entry opts for a more plot-driven, action-heist approach, focusing deeply on the criminal undertakings of Dom Toretto and his crew as they navigate the dangerous streets of Rio de Janeiro.While the shift towards a more narrative-heavy, business-like focus on organized crime marks a significant departure from the street racing roots of the series, it opens up a new dimension to the characters. We see them not just as racers but as full-fledged heist specialists, expanding the franchise's appeal but at the risk of alienating its core audience who loved the car-centric ethos.One cannot discuss ""Fast Five"" without noting its intense action sequences. The film pushes the envelope with set pieces that include dragging a massive bank vault through busy city streets, defying the laws of physics in ways that can only be described as outlandish yet entertaining. This emphasis on spectacle over realism might draw criticism for being too over-the-top, but it also adds a unique flavor of thrill that's hard to find elsewhere.Amidst the action, the film does not forget its roots in family and brotherhood, themes that have tethered the franchise together since the beginning. Dom's unwavering dedication to his family, and his ability to weave these values into the crew's dynamic, provides an emotional anchor amid the chaos. It reinforces the bond between the characters, giving depth to their interactions and motivations beyond mere monetary gains.Overall, ""Fast Five"" represents a bold evolution in the series, steering away from pure street racing to embrace a broader heist thriller aspect. While this might disappoint some long-time fans, it also reinvigorates the franchise with fresh energy and a more expansive storyline. The blend of action and character-driven narrative earns ""Fast Five"" a solid 6 out of 10, acknowledging both its departures and its daring endeavors in storytelling.",schmittfalte,"Apr 21, 2024"
10,Fast Five Rulez,I saw this movie yesterday and I enjoyed it this the fourth movie I saw by myself in this they go to Rio so this the only Fast & Furious I saw in cinemas but I will the sixth one if there is one I enjoyed every moment of it but I will warn you that there's a lot of shooting involved but no one ends up in hospital I enjoyed this movie a lot andThis movie starts off where the 4th movie left off with Brian O'Conner leading an insult and Dominic Toretto is going to prison but a car crashed in the prison busyesterday I went to see this movie at Sunnybank because I ask if I could go see it and she said yes.My favorite character is Brian O'Conner he is a good guy and I usually go for the good guysMy favorite part of the movie was where they used the toy car with a camera I found it funny .I hope you will to,adammitterer,"Apr 22, 2011"

10,"Best of the ""Fast"" Series","Fast Five is a terrific action movie with a well written script. The action scenes are the best in the entire Fast series and I rate the Fast Five a solid 10 stars. For sheer thrills and edge of your seat action don't miss this movie. Romance is kept to a minimum, a must for action movies, and the next chase, gun fight etc. is just a couple minutes away. The 110 minutes on the screen went by in a flash, another indication of how great this movie is. I've been to movies where 2 hours seem like 2 days. D Johnson really held up his part of the movie and was very believable in his DSS (FBI) like role. BTW I usually don't rate the movies I really like above a 7 or 8 stars, but Fast Five deserves the entire ammo belt load of 10 stars.

7,From racing into heist.,"The fifth installment puts several gallons of gas in the tank of this car-crazy franchise. Fast Five (also known as Fast and Furious 5 outside North America) is primed to equal if not better the $71 million opening weekend of its 2009 predecessor. Director Justin Lin, back for his third go-around, opens it up in top gear; a mere 30 seconds elapse before the first screech of tires rent the air. The film is set in a much grittier Rio than the recent screen version populated by animated birds. This is the most expensive installment yet and it's clear the budget wasn't used on acting lessons for the cast.Dwayne Johnson appears to be having fun with his overzealous staccato delivery. Walker and Brewster are as one-dimensional as ever, even while harboring a little secret that may see us lumbered with a future instalment titled Fast and Furious: The Next Generation.",Mysterygeneration,"Dec 21, 2021"
1,typical American b***sh*t,One of the worst movie i have ever seen.Basically these type of American movies have nothing in them. And this one is no different. Just different characters . thats it. otherwise the theme is always the same. The American military is again there ( any good movie for an American should involve the military.. pathetic mentality..)The only good thing about this movie is it was filmed in Rio De Janeiro. I think the whole movie was for a fight between Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson. I really don't know how this movie got 7.8 rating. Never trust a movie with the so called American heroes.,itzzarun,"May 12, 2011"

7,Rio Grande,"Ohhh. We're definitely starting to get there now. If ""Fast and Furious"" was the soft reboot to set us on the new path, ""Fast Five"" is a statement of intent for the series going forward.Having been liberated from the Prison transport, the Toretto family head to South America. They reconnect with Vince (Matt Schulze) and, in need of money, get involved in a job stealing cars from a moving train. The job goes wrong, and several DEA agents are killed by men working for local Drug Lord Hernan Reyes (Joaquin De Almieda). Framed for the murders, Dom (Vin Diesel), Mia (Jordana Brewster) and Brian (Paul Walker) become a target for accomplished DSS Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson). Whilst avoiding capture, Dom decides on revenge against Reyes and calls in his friends and family for assistance.We're right at the crossover point here between the family being up against small time gangs to international terrorists. Reyes is still, I suppose, just a drug dealer, but the power he wields in Rio, over the police in particular makes him a much more dangerous opponent. Things are getting more preposterous though. The initial assault on the transport bus would clearly kill everyone on board immediately and whilst the vault heist is great (perhaps still the high point of the whole series, hence it's triumphant return in ""Fast X"") there's no getting away from the fact that they must kill hundreds of people (both cops and innocent bystanders) as part of it.The core of 'La Familia' are together now though, with Han, Giselle, Tej and Roman all together and Elsa arriving into the plot too. They're all relatively lacklustre when weighed against Dwayne Johnson though, who arrives in this series like a colossus and very nearly takes it over - it's clear why Diesel and he struggle to co-exist in the franchise after the next one.We're getting closer to the insanity - which I'm pretty sure starts in the post credits scene of this one and goes from here. Strap in.",southdavid,"Jun 30, 2023"
10,Absolutely Fantastic.,"I think it is safe to say that this is the best installment of the franchise.The whole movie, from the cast to the location, the action to the comedy, was spot on. Just when I thought they were leaving the whole car element out of the movie, boom, there they are. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson played a fantastic partIt's a perfect blend of the style that Ocean's Eleven adopted, in regards to bringing the best in the business in, and everything we loved about the original Fast and Furious movies.Don't even get me started on the utterly flawless twist at the end. 3/4's of the movie theatre left and didn't get to witness it after the credits, but literally, I was speechless.Brilliant movie and it should be watched by all.",steffenxo,"Apr 22, 2011"

9,So ridiculously sweet!,"""Don't ever EVER let them get into cars."" - HobbsEspecially when dragging a vault...yep!I saw this movie with my best pals at a midnight showing. We had an absolute blast! I really dig the Fast and Furious franchise for it's fantastic mix of fast cars, pretty ladies, crazy stunts, fun action, cheesy dialogue and acting, and sense of family! This movie takes all of that and just cranks it up!Picking up exactly where the last film ended, Fast Five continues the story with Dom, Brian, and Mia on the run in Rio. This time, they are being hunted by Hobbs, played by the huge and highly enjoyable Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. The tension in this pick is crazy! His fight scene with Dom is definitely one to remember! Many characters from the previous four movies are also in this one! Great idea, filmmakers! This movie is kinda like Ocean's Eleven with cars and you can tell the people making these films are having a blast. The actions scenes in this one are wild! Justin Lin shoots his action clearly- no endless shaky cam! The vault-dragging scene is ridiculously sweet and one of my favorite scenes from the series! The train sequence rocks too! There's also hand-to-hand combat, shootouts, chases. Don't forget a ton of humor and each character has a moment to shine. The chemistry between the cast is fantastic. They are one big epic family. I like how these movies maintain a continuity between films (nice to see Vince in there.Fast Five is a highly enjoyable, action film with some truly awesome action, comedy, drama, suspense! Stay after credits!",joshrortiz,"May 27, 2013"
6,It has its moments,"Fast Five is an improvement on its predecessor. The film nicely picks up from the last film to continue the story. Bryan truly ditches his badge and fully commits to Dom and their lifestyle, he is now wanted by the authorities and on the run. This film does well with the storyline around the heist and the high stakes surrounding it. Not only are they gong after a dangerous drug lord but also everyone under his power. Also to add another level of craziness is breaking into the police station to steal his money. There are some ridiculous and unrealistic scenes towards the end of the film. How could Dom pull a locker that is lodged in concrete and drag it throughout the streets as if it was as light as a kite? These over the top and unrealistic scenes bring the film down a bit.",Kingslaay,"Jun 23, 2023"

The plot didn't disappoint either. Everything made sense and there was no over board, unnecessary scenes. What I loved the most was the bond that Dom and Brian and Mia brought to the screen through out the film.

5,How to mess up an action movie,"I confess to not being a big fan of the 'Fast..."" series. I do enjoy a good action film. I didn't enjoy this one due to it exceeding my ability to suspend disbelief quotient. Cars CANNOT do those things. If you show the stars having their first hot meal in a while eating like hungry dogs, then how do they later afford the stuff they need for the 'job'?. How, in a country run by the criminal they rob, do they get fake passports? Fast Five is too full of these issues for my mind to sit there on idle. It wakes up and busts out of the jar I put it in prior to going in to thee movie, and kicks the inside of my skull. Stop it! get out now! But no, I stayed to the end. Rental Only.",NDanger,"May 24, 2011"
No rating,Fast five is one heck of a ride,"You would think by the fifth movie in this franchise comes out that the wheels on this car ride would start to fall flat, but I have to say this is the best movie of the series. This car driven film series has been given a new tune up of story, reshaping of the body style of the outlook of adventure, and a high octane upgrade of action that makes the ride a bit smoother. It felt refreshing to see the director bring most of the cast from the other Fast and Furious movies together without polluting the story with too many people. There are so many changes to what we were given in the first Fast and Furious franchise that it does fill like the original film any more, but something better that is more enjoyable. It drops the drag racing and replaces it with the heist feel of the Ocean 11 films, mixed with the action of a Bad Boys movie, and car driving and plot of the Italian job. The only flaw of this movie is the acting is not as good as you think it would be after all these years, but the director does a great job of noticing this flaw and replacing it with comedy that hasn't been present in most of the movies. Also Dwayne Johnson is a great addition to the already famous cast and he fits in perfect and ups the action of the movie even more with his presence. This is what a summer movie feels like and gives",mcgriff1290,"Jul 11, 2011"

9,"Very cool cars, sexy people, lots of action, and gorgeous Rio de Janeiro","Fast Five is an ocean of motion and it never lets up. It was the first movie I saw in the IMAX format and it washed over me like a tsunami.From the beginning, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), his consigliere Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), and others are stealing impounded lux cars from train packed with DEA agents while it's still operating. The cars are for Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida, always a gem), the crime boss of Rio de Janeiro. Great set piece: A big ole truck rides alongside to act as midwife to the cars as they roll from boxcar to the ground at high rates of speed. O'Conner's fighting with Reyes' henchman whose operating the industrial truck. He knocks him off and is hanging on for dear life as Toretto drives up trying to catch him before he smashes against a bridge pillar. Shot to shot to shot, he jumps, truck explodes in blaze of glory, and he and Diesel do a slo-mo dive into a raging river way down below, all three of them, Walker, Diesel and the car. The cars should have top billing. Especially the cars at the end when Roman (Tyrese Gibson) pulls up with hot babe in tow and his bud Tej (Chris 'Ludicrous' Bridges), a hard working day job man, slyly has his hot babe drive up in the same car.What's the movie about? Hot fast shiny cars, keep the motor running, sexy people (""We're a family!""), $100 million in untraceable bills and two identical bank vaults. Tyrese and Ludicrous bantering like old friends. But never forget the 3 monuments to Mother Nature, Dwayne Johnson, Vin Diesel and Rio de Janeiro. Rio should have gotten top billing as a person in its own right. The beach at Ipanema. The hills covered with colorful houses in stadium seating.Diesel's less combustible than he's been before. He's the natural leader but picks his words carefully and all his crew lean in for every word.If you like cars, sexy people, lots of action, gorgeous Rio de Janeiro, an implausibly irresistible heist and tawdry touches of Mission Impossible and Ocean's Eleven, you'll like Fast Five.",CassandraSparkles,"May 4, 2011"
7,Furious 5,"Vin diesel and paul walker are really good in this making this really entertaining and fun to watch.Insane stunts, chases, and fights. This starts the entertainingly craziness of this movie franchise.",MB-reviewer185,"Apr 24, 2021"
8,Faster and faster.,"Fast Five has enough machismo and testosterone to make The Expendables look subdued. It's much more of a straight up action/heist film than the previous movies, with the occasional car chase scene to remind you it's still a Fast & Furious movie (if all the returning faces aren't enough to let you know). And it works. This is a really fun flick to watch in an ""Ocean's Eleven meets the gleeful carnage of a Michael Bay movie"" kind of way that's entertaining and ridiculously over-the-top. Fast Five is easily the best movie of the series, and probably one of the most exciting movies of the year. Dwayne Johnson is a perfect addition to the cast and his confrontations with Diesel's character is among the many highlights of the film, plus it's good to see the old cast members back in action. If you want an action romp that breezes by without getting to serious, looks slick, and just doesn't know what it means to slow down, this will give you all you need and more.",lewiskendell,"Dec 2, 2011"
6,Fast Five deals with troubles of identity and becomes pointless but highly entertaining...,"When I first saw the first movie of this series, I said to myself ""Yes, Julian, good entertainment like never before"". After all these years, Fast Five is promoted as being the last one, the grand finale, the ultimate conclusion to the story of our horse-power rider heroes. Fast Five detach itself from the racing plague and transforms into another heist movie which bring nothing new except a few really entertaining chase scenes. So where to begin? The story starts with the planned break-out of Dominic (Vin Diesel) who was convicted for 25 years in jail. It starts with a ridiculous stunt but I got over it fastly. The group then ends up in Brasil and gets into trouble while trying to steal 3 cars from a moving train. The chase itself, the whole operation is entertaining but impossible, deadly and the last but not the least, hilarious in real life. You get the feeling you're watching scenes from 2012. However, Dom, Brian (Paul Walker), Mia (Jordana Brewster) and Vince (Matt Schulze) deal with real issues after they find out they stole an important cip which was hidden in one of the cars owned by an even more important person in Rio. The most feared and powerful drug dealer, Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). Nothing impressive wait? Oh wait. The ""FBI dudes"" from the States sent one of the best teams in Rio to catch them. This elite task is ran by Luke Hobbs (Dwyane Johnson) which is pretty much the old-school, hand-by-hand tough guy. The movie moves pretty fast. We get to find out that Mia is pregnant so of course, Dom and Briand head out for the most clicheic ""last job"" ever. They get to reunite with all their friends from the previous movies, Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson), Tej Parker (Ludacris) and Han Lue (Sung Kang). They give green lights for a plan to steal Reyes's drug money. We get the usual guy who wants to get out but once he finds out the kind of money involved he gets back in, we get to see few actual races, some nice beautiful women, big men acting all like a bunch of wrestlers and showing their muscles and we'll even get the bad guy joining the good guys. We're also given, I think, the biggest death toll in this series.As far as their plans, there's no real in-depth look. We're just given small pieces and the rest we must figure for ourselves even some matches don't fit this whole pretentious job. With all the cons we still are entertained and the last part of the movie, the final confrontation actually pays it off even if it gets a little bit cheesy with the sentimental nonsense. As for the acting part, I had one big problem with Dwyane Johnson's delivery. His lines always felt forced like he was reading the script or something. I love The Rock but I still think as an actor... he's still at the beginning.The technical part of the movie is quite impressive. Tough chase scenes, crazy stunts and good fight sequences. I had a problem with some effects like the train wagon explosion. Far from being realistic enough. I also had problems with the lightning and with the continuous and repeating use of wide-city shots between certain scenes. It's the easiest way to make a transition between scenes. It's a cinematographer weakness, especially in a movie like this which has the possibility of looking much much better. The music was pretty good, intense and fitted the atmosphere.Overall, Fast Five was a disappointment as far as a Fast & Furious movie. Fast Five was a disappointment as far as an overall heist movie because of the overused clicheic pieces of story. Fast Five was a disappointment as far as the ridiculous action scenes in it. Despite all that, despite the negative view I have on it I must admit I was entertained. It was a good time. Now, Fast Five deals with troubles of identity. It feels like the last one but it leaves room for another one. And since we already know they'll make another one I have some questions? Why the misleading marketing? Why the misleading point of the movie? Why did they had to make it pointless?",montera_iulian,"May 29, 2011"

7,Finally,"The series was finally piecing it together in the last film but the storyline was slightly underdeveloped. Fast five manages to resuscitate the series and course correct it into something more fun and mainstream. If you look at how far the series has changed along the way, it's quite impressive. Justin Lin has grown into the saviour of the series and the film benefits from the style he started developing in Tokyo Drift. The film is growing in cast with each new film and while Diesel and Walker aren't the only reason people turn up, the hole required to replace them would. The series is now having fun with the premise but the idea of this film series running 10 movies is absolutely insane.",nicholls905-280-546911,"Apr 24, 2020"
10,"""Fast Five"" is Fabulous, Fantastic, and Fun!","While I love ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, I kinda don't like how they title some installments, such as ""Fast and Furious"" in 2009 (actually a fourth film) and now this. They drop ""furious"" in the fifth film and I don't know why. I guess it's for creative pursuit, but the adjectives ""fast"" and ""furious"" accurately describe the films' premise and atmosphere. Anyway, if you enjoy the previous four films, you'll definitely enjoy this for the fifth time. Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker) work together with their friends to disarm a powerful Brazilian drug lord through a 100 million dollar heist. Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) joins this movie, so prepare for greater battle.This is a major shift in the franchise, as they incorporate the heist sub-genre. So there are less racing, but the car chases are still there. I love how they plan their moves to get the vault. The police wants Dom and Brian, so the duo obviously has to run away inside the fast cars! The vault-dragging scene, which is apparently boasted in the trailer, is very fun and high-octane to watch. How the hell did they shoot that in a city? Editing is very good, the music is very pumping for the car sequences, and stunts are crazier than ever. A surprise character enters the storyline, so watch out.This movie reminds me of ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" in terms of action and racial diversity, and it's interesting to note that this film and that film are fifth entries of their own franchises. Like how I love ""Resident Evil"" movies, I love the ""Fast and Furious"" movies!",AdrianOlonan,"Jul 17, 2015"

No rating,mindless but sure to please,"Diesel, Walker, and Brewster are on the run from the law and hightail it to Rio de Janeiro where they recruit some old friends to pull off one final job before they go their separate ways. But the group's daring plan quickly goes awry, they receive some unexpected family news, and they suddenly find themselves targeted by bloodhound federal agent Johnson—who never met a mark he couldn't collar. Preposterous plotting and cardboard villains abound, but made watchable by high-octane action scenes, effective casting, beautiful women, gratuitous fight scenes, great scenery, and everything else needed to pass for escapist entertainment. Overlong and incoherent, but fast enough, furious enough, and fun enough to satisfy the target audience. **½",Special-K88,"Apr 29, 2011"
6,"Long, flashy, not much driving","The movie lasted for a staggering two hours and ten minutes, time in which driving, the foundation of the ""Fast"" franchise, was left in the backseat. The rest, weapons, flashy heist planning and ridiculous intrigue. There had to be a bad guy that was corrupt, rich and utterly evil, there had to be a henchman, just as evil, with a host of faceless drones to command, there had to be a good and honest cop that would chase them, but ultimately respect the gang for who they are, and there had to be chicks. And of course... the gang. ""The best of the best"" almost copied and pasted from Ocean's 3214.That doesn't mean it wasn't a good fun action filled film, just that it was a melange of ideas that were far removed from what I liked in other Fast and Furious films. I love Dwayne Johnson and he played very well the role of the tireless cop, I like Vin Diesel, even if he seems to be on a descendant curve in his career and all the other actors did their jobs well. The thing is: was it worth waiting an hour and a half for a final race that defied logic, physics and probability and yet had little to do with driving? Not really.",siderite,"Mar 12, 2012"
8,Fast Money,"I only seen the first Fast and the Furious and I own it on DVD. I skipped out on the sequels, mostly because of the bad word of mouth. When Fast Five was released, I didn't have intentions on seeing it until I learned that The Rock was in it. However, I wasn't sure if the film would deliver. After some positive word of mouth from several people, I was convinced on seeing it. So on a cold, rainy day and an awful week that had passed me by, I decided to give this movie a spin.And boy was I surprised!Fast Five is one exhilarating movie! It didn't start out well. Without seeing the previous installments, and barely remembering the first, I was a little lost in the beginning. Where things picked up was in the train robbery scene where Vin Diesel and Paul Walker (who's best performance is in Running Scared) are having that fight scene. It was pretty awesome, up until the end but I guess that's where the suspension of disbelief comes into play.The movie doesn't linger onto any dramatic scenes for too long. The filmmakers know that their target audience came for the fast cars and action. Who cares about any subplots and talking? The Rock makes a grand entrance and is provided with enough screen time to make The Rock fans happy. I also like the turn of events with his character near the end. It was handled brilliantly.Speaking of the end, the climax is probably one of the best climaxes I've seen in a very long time. I think it probably nailed the whole summer movie feel. By the end of the movie, I felt that this is what summer movies are meant to be. I don't know if the director Justin Lin saved the franchise, as I don't even know if the franchise was in trouble in the first place. However, this movie might have introduced more fans. With the series being stagnant for so long, I can honestly say that I'll be looking forward to the sixth installment.",Fields201,"May 15, 2011"
7,A Thrilling Heist that Ignites a New Era of the Franchise,"""Fast Five"" propels the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise to new heights with its electrifying blend of high-octane action, intense heists, and an ensemble cast firing on all cylinders. Picking up where the previous installment left off, the plot follows Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), and their crew as they plan a daring heist in Rio de Janeiro while being pursued by a relentless federal agent (Dwayne Johnson).The film takes the franchise in a refreshing direction by incorporating the elements of a heist thriller. The meticulously planned and executed heist sequences are the heart of the film, showcasing the crew's impressive driving skills, precision teamwork, and audacious strategies. Each action set piece is expertly choreographed, filled with breathtaking stunts and jaw-dropping moments that will leave you on the edge of your seat.What sets ""Fast Five"" apart is the seamless integration of beloved characters from previous films. The chemistry between the cast members is palpable, with Vin Diesel and Paul Walker delivering standout performances that anchor the film. Dwayne Johnson's introduction as federal agent Luke Hobbs adds a new dynamic to the story, bringing his own brand of intensity and charisma to the table.The plot not only delivers adrenaline-pumping action but also delves into the characters' personal lives, exploring their motivations, loyalties, and the importance of family. It strikes a perfect balance between heart-pounding thrills and emotional resonance, making us invest in the characters and their journey.The film's breathtaking cinematography captures the vibrant streets of Rio de Janeiro, providing a visually stunning backdrop for the high-speed chases and explosive action.

Buckle up and get ready for an unforgettable ride.",sufyaanrashid95,"May 2, 2023"
8,Vin Diesel does The Italian Job,"This is the best film in the series, probably because it borrowed heavily from the recent version of The Italian Job. It borrowed ideas such as deciding to use a fast, nimble car to navigate through a narrow parking garage, creating a copy of the target location in which to practice, obtaining the same safe they will need to crack later, and using street cameras to direct cars through traffic. All of these elements were used in The Italian Job. Oddly enough, rumors had it that a sequel to The Italian Job was going to be made and be set in Brazil but it was never made. Was this supposed to be that sequel? Probably not. A sequel would've had new ideas and this one just had a rehash of old ones.Anyway, despite similarities to The Italian Job, this film was entertaining and enjoyable to watch.",jcallows,"Oct 10, 2011"

The action scenes are exhilarating too a whole new level.Everyone was great in this one no weak links to be found which also made it a great movie going experience.some standouts;Tyrese Gibson from the urban drama classic ""Baby Boy"", really played his character..he was hilarious in every scene he had!!! The Rock(Dwayne Johnson) was Excellent Luke Hobbs who was bad ass in his role and looked to be enjoying be apart of the cast..the pivotal scene where he is down and looks to be out help and unexpected is on the way in such a epic guns blazing scene that was so damn good! I almost gave this movie a 10 because seriously it is that good of a movie and by and I don't give movies 10 these days .Go see this!!! its worth it and u wont never regret it!!! Best Movie Of The Summer!!! A",cedicedi,"May 27, 2011"
7,Where everything changed,"As a teenager, I thought this was the best in the franchise and it makes sense considering how much action-packed it is and the whole ensemble coming together and their banter in it. But this time around for the first 40 minutes I was confused why this was the first critically acclaimed movie in the franchise because that 40 minutes was filled with stupid dialogues that is directed in the most cringey way possible with few thrills in there. But then they start assembling the crew and it became a proper heist movie and it started making sense why it is considered good. From that point on it kept entertaining throughout the movie.The Rock is way better here compared to most of his roles before this but looking back now, he wasn't as charming as his later lead roles for which he is more known for nowadays. The ensemble is really what worked the best film though. All of them together make this movie great to watch.This is where everything changed for the franchise and the scope of it really became huge but it still lacks the heart of the first movie and the tightness of Tokyo Drift. And it seemed like they wanted to connect Tokyo Drift through later movies from dialogues and I wonder how could they think that's a good idea, do they want us to think Japan in this movie's world is behind everywhere else to look like that after the events of these movies being so modern?",Jithindurden,"May 9, 2023"
9,"""Best in the F&F series till date""","Fast Five is F&F franchise's awesome film till date in terms of acting action emotion heist and all of its genres are being presented very beautifully.The entry of Dwayne Johnson as Luke Hobbs make this film even better though he loses the fight with Vin diesel but he was awesome.The other supporting actors were good Tyrese Gibson was making a good balance of Comedy through the whole movie the techs,gadgets, heist plan, action, stunts were all awesome in this movie..Whole movie was awesome it was not at all boring it gives you the excitement as you want totally worth watchable movie...Hail F&F series!!!!!........",yashrajs536,"Jul 6, 2015"
6,Was it really all worth for that final car chase,"If You've seen the trailer, this review won't spoil anything: There is a car chase in the end, but if you feel it kinda drags on I will tell why I felt that.In an usual police chase the policemen needs to catch on first and then there is constant pressure from their side to knock you out. But in Fast Five I felt that after first destroyed vehicle the cops needed to spend another 5 seconds to even hit the runners. After that police car gets destroyed, another 10 seconds till they are near: Not constant danger of doing a wrong turn and being busted.In contrast to what they give us in trailers: Few seconds for police to arrive and then constant mayhem. Tho a lot of car crashes is quite expensive only for one minute, you need to put some effort to make it a five minutes worth car chase.",Kristupas-vazix,"May 20, 2011"

No rating,A return to what made the fast and furious great,Fast five {or the fast and furious 5} The fast five was a breath of fresh air for a otherwise stale series. I found the film to be both exciting and well written. The returning characters did not seem to be forced into the storyline they flowed nicely. I was really skeptical going into watching this film. After a few missed guided attempts at the series but For me it had rawness of fast and furious movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed the first film as well as newcomers to it. As a fan of these movies I hope in the future other installments of the fast and furious series has the same heart as this one.,twbfilm89,"Oct 16, 2011"

But OMG this one has it all, from beginning to end is great entertainment, nothing more nothing less. Its like having together the best parts of the franchise with a touch of oceans eleven and some action scenes that are simply jaw dropping. This is how all the past movies should have been and being this a 5th part that is quit an achievement maybe it is an exaggeration but for me this is the masterpiece of all the 5th parts.

7,Five and counting,"Fast Five is the latest in the action-driven, visually stunning, Fast and the Furious series. I would think it's the last installment, but these days I suppose anything is possible. It begins with brother and sister Dom and Mia Toretto (Vin Diesel and Jordana Brewster) along with ex-law enforcement officer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) as wanted fugitives on the move and in need of gainful, thought not legal, employment. Once they find a job and prove unsuccessful in performing it, they are now sought by a drug kingpin and faux philanthropist who contracted them in the first place.Rather than knuckle under or retreat, the trio decides to bankrupt their unscrupulous foe, and thereby render him powerless. For this they need help and that is the reason they bring any living associates they from the previous films that played a significant role. All the while their nemesis has informed the American authorities as to their location in an effort to spoil their plans. Enter The Rock, playing U.S. Marshal Luke Hobbs, with the unflinching assistance of the Rio police, who are paid agents of the aforementioned kingpin. In addition, Hobbs has a very rigid view of his responsibility for the larger portion of the film. Fast Five isn't anything its predecessors weren't. Save for a little misdirection at the end. It's about beautiful cars, beautiful women, and the occasional fistfight or shootout. In that regard it's a success.",Treyroo,"Nov 24, 2012"

9,Kick ass,"This is one franchise that I wait every time to give some thing really special. And no doubt they have given some thing special. As always there is no dearth for the action sequences but I should say there are much less action sequences when compared to the previous ones. For sure those that are there are just awesome. Through out its fully energy packed and I don't have to mention about the adrenaline rush that the franchise gives. Personally I was sad that they cut a scene on street racing. A car for a car thing. How I wish they made an action packed adrenaline pumping stuff out of that. But as such as I said there is absolutely no dearth for action and adrenaline rush. Elsa Pataky(Elena Neves), Sung Kang(Han Lue) and Gal Gadot(Gisele Harabo) have done a good job out of their roles. Gal Gadot's scene on getting a finger print from the ruthless drug lord was really funny. It would be incomplete if I don't mention about Dwayne Johnson(Luke Hobbs). Amazing stuff from him as usual. Really enjoyed the fight between Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson. Must watch stuff. Although I found the vault dragging sequence to be not too logical I would say all in all its a must watch movie.

6,How about realism?,"OK I wont bitch around here, even though I am not really into unrealistic movies this ain't the reason I didn't like it that much.

But what really bothered me was the lack of creativity (hah, that rhymed), that makes us all fortunetellers. In this movie nothing unsuspected happens which you would probably expect from a movie like this. However the action was actually great.

The cars, the weapons, the exact model of the super safe, the money, or even the beers they drank? The screenplay writers have no respect of the viewers least I.Q. and treated us like morons who only played and believed the scenarios of video games, the plots, the weaponry, the killings, the thefts and so on, everything just showed up whenever or wherever you wanted or needed. There were so many flaws in this poorly crafted screenplay, the plot was so ridiculous that you have to put your basic reasoning ability aside or into deep coma to allow those absolutely impossible handy stuff appeared on the screen one after another, and don't forget their playground was in Brazil? Get an exact model of the super safe right away? Need a fast car, go get it from a street race. Need several police cars to fool the police underground garage security camera? Go get from the police carpool yard. Need a warehouse to hide? No problem, you got it right away. Want to get into the police security system? That's easy, man, just clogging their toilets and without hiring by the police to call their plumbing service, you just walked in to fix it?

7,Too many characters and too little action?,"For those of us who watched all of the Fast and the Furious series, simply the thought of having most of the main characters from the past editions in one movie is a valid reason to pay. The result is just what we expect of a Fast and Furious: stunts, rides and babes. The atmosphere of Rio is a refreshing alternative to American centered filming. However, ultimately, the film goes over the top. By telling the story through the view of the (not that) good guys, the bad guys, and, also, a third perspective, that of a team of elite FBI agents led by ""The Rock"", time worthy of boiling oil and pumping adrenaline is lost. Instead, we get more of the sit-at-home work-out-plan kind of scenes that are often unnecessary. Nevertheless, a true fan of cars and action will find Fast Five very enjoyable.",mauro-batte,"May 14, 2011"
8,The BEST of the franchise!,"The franchise resurrects. The cast matures. The crew grows up. And, The Rock joins the gang. The derailed series is finally back on track since the original with upgrades in all the departments of film-making. if you think this is a movie with races, you're wrong. Taking a different route this time, the film makers have transformed the street racing franchise into the heist action film which isn't a bad thing, this transformation has worked wonders for the movie & the franchise. Fast Five is the genuine summer blockbuster of the year, without a doubt. Its the kind of big action, big Ka-pow movie that the audience doesn't want to get bogged down in the details on if they just want to have fun. The situations these guys go through is unbelievable, we know that the way these characters drive they should all have died in the first Fast and Furious, but we know this is just a fun and entertaining franchise and we try to make peace with the screenplay as best we can because it is just fun to see these guys go at it. It's fun to see them drive cars off a running train, or speed by busy streets without crashing into each other while at the same time avoiding all sorts of bullets and explosions. Fast Five might be the most unbelievable and improbable film of the franchise, but it is still the best one. While this movie doesn't have much straight up street racing its got plenty of everything else. This is the one sequel where they got the action right on all aspects. Not much CGI at all unless it was so good you couldn't tell. Vin Diesel & Paul Walker continue to be effective in their respective parts. Jordana Brewster is fair. Tyrese Gibson is first-rate and brings in a host of laughs in the goings-on. Ludicrous is good. Matt Schulze, Sung Kang & Gal Gadot are passable. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson is absolutely superb in a strong supporting role. He imposes as a formidable rival. Here Johnson's straight arrow persona leverages the story's ultimate conflict. Showcasing Director Justin Lin's signature accelerated precision, Vin Diesel's Dom races beside the speeding train as Paul Walker's Brian leaps into Dom's sports car. Their car immediately sways over a steep chasm into the river below. Diesel and Walker leap in midair out of the car, and plunge into the water. ""Fast Five"" is just great fun. Writer Chris Morgan's story is better than the last ""Fast and Furious"", which isn't saying much. Then again we don't see ""Fast Five"" for the narrative nuances. Non-stop action reigns supreme. Lin has a crisp vibrant visual style, and acumen for insane action. Lin has two cars racing through the streets of Rio dragging a bank vault unleashing mass destruction. Granted this is over the top, and completely original. ""Fast Five"" has stunning Rio de Janeiro locals, gorgeous women, fast cars, and Vin Diesel squaring off against ""The Rock"" Dwayne Johnson. Lin has methodically checked off all the boxes. The Taiwanese director is getting really good with his craft. Car chase is obviously the top draw. Just as you wonder what else he can give you that you haven't seen before, he comes up with things that take you to yet another level of mindless pleasure. The movie doesn't linger onto any dramatic scenes for too long. The filmmakers know that their target audience came for the fast cars and action. Who cares about any subplots and talking? The Rock makes a grand entrance and is provided with enough screen time to make The Rock fans happy. I also like the turn of events with his character near the end. It was handled brilliantly. Fast Five delivers what it promises and even more. There are a lot of action sequences and they are shot extremely well. The cars move really fast, but that isn't all Fast Five has going for it. The addition of The Rock to the story sets up an interesting fight scene between him and Dominic(which is one of my all time favorite fight sequence). The Rock helped boost the series even more and brought something fresh to the franchise. There is also the plus that the film took place in Rio de Janeiro and the scenery there is just so beautiful. There is a great chase scene that takes place over the roofs of the houses, reminiscent of the Bourne Ultimatum scene in Morocco. Yes, the story is improbable, but we still are allowed to have fun with it. Cinematography is perfect. The soundtrack is also great.""Fast Five"" is not going to win any awards. It is just great fun. I look forward to the next sequel.I rate it 7.5 out of 10.",prateak09,"May 18, 2011"

7,Fast Five,"Frankly speaking, I was unforeseen that this adrenal-driven car-chasing franchise had have such a longevity during this decade since THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS in 2001 (neither am I an automobile zealot). Now here arrives the fifth installment, which surprisingly has unequivocally became the best of the series (quite rare when it comes terms with sequels). One ground rule is that the team behind knows exactly what their audience's hearts want and exaggerates it to a breathtaking effect, e.g. several vintage-model cars (which I am sheerly ignorant of), brawny men bare fist combat (Vin and Dwayne, which makes Paul Walker looks more wooden and sulky), a mission-impossible scheme, a tint of romantics and sexy appeal using its hottie female cast (Gal Gadot, again, the former Miss Israel), and the most essential one, a prolonged vehicle-chase with its eye-popping collateral damage, which is the ace in the hole!Setting against a Rio de Janeiro backdrop, the second time this year after the successful animation RIO among Hollywood A-list blockbusters, director Justin Lin (who was also behind the wheels of the 3rd and 4th film) shrewdly maneuvers an OCEAN ELEVEN mode heist plot to bolster the intensive impulsion of the rapid tempo. Plus the visual effect is high-end enough to coerce me to neglect the implausibility of certain details. My eyes are satisfied while my brain cannot find anything to whine about at all once (during the afterthought, there are plenty of bugs there though), so one sure thing is that FAST FIVE has set a new beacon for the Hollywood mega-budgeted action films, it is a fierce competition which principally hinges on script writers' imagination, I also invent the punchline for the production company: we can make anything look real on screen, as long as there is a mind can reach it!",lasttimeisaw,"Sep 15, 2011"
8,Not an average F&F movie,"The trailer gave me an adrenalin rush and my curiosity was more peaked comparing to the previous movies. But if you think this is a movie with races, you're wrong.This is a heist movie. But that isn't a bad thing, on the contrary! This franchise could use a fresh start and the big difference was that they toned down showing off fast cars and beautiful women, Fast Five is more character driven and brings back a lot of characters from previous movies, included a nice surprise at the end.My guess is we're probably gonna see more familiar faces in part 6, but we will have to wait for that. We also got new faces, in the form of Dwayne Johnson. It's a nice addition to see how he's determined to arrest the main characters and that the main characters are deep in trouble with several parties hunting them.Also different is that there isn't a single race in this one, but it has a lot of action and even subtle humor we haven't seen in the previous installments.Action fans, just go see it when you can!",lekkerinmevel,"May 15, 2011"
7,Fast Five,"Picking up hot on the heels of the last film, the newly escaped ""Dom"" (Vin Diesel), his ex-FBI pal ""O'Conner"" (Paul Walker) and ""Mia"" (Jordan Brewster) have to keep skipping one step ahead of the pursuing law led by ""Hobbs"" (Dwayne Johnson) and, whilst cornered in Rio, they must assemble everyone with driving skills so as to thwart the ambitions of drug lord ""Reyes"" (Joaquim de Almeida) whom they have seriously hacked off. This effort sacrifices a little of the pace and speed of the other films and tries to focus on a slightly stronger story with some better characterisations - that does mean that it can be a bit on the slow side at times and maybe we get just one thoughtful pose from Diesel too many, but as we head towards a fairly predictable denouement this easily (for my money, anyway) tops the list of F&F films before clearly teeing us up for number 6. I think it's closer in quality and standard to the first film - and still has plenty of burnt rubber and lively stunts to keep it watchable.",CinemaSerf,"May 15, 2023"

To make an cool action set piece short, Brian and Mia flip the damn bus over and get Dom out of it (somehow). I remember when I saw this action sequence for the first time, I realised the absurd hilarity of it all and so I whispered to my closest friend, ""we should try that some time."" My whole group proceeded to laugh at my remark, and then we shared quite a few laughs throughout the rest of the movie. Now, thinking back on that bus flipping moment, I begin to realise that Fast Five might have been that one movie that made me really appreciate fun, mindless action movies.After Brian and Mia manage to get Dom out of police custody, the trio meets up in Rio where they're joined by Vince (Schulze) from the original Fast and the Furious. Vince tells them that they need to steal some cars from a moving train and you bet your ass it's as awesome as it sounds. After a glorious action sequence on board a train, Fast Five introduces Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson, who plays my second favourite character of the franchise here), a Diplomatic Security Service agent who wants to hunt Dom and his crew down and bring them all into custody. Meanwhile, Dom and his team (who I'll call ""Dom's Ten"") create a plan to steal $100 million from a crazy Brazilian guy named Reyes in a much cooler style than Danny Ocean's master plan of stealing millions of dollars from three Las Vegas casinos.Fast Five has, undoubtedly, a story that drives very far away from those original racing roots that the series was known for back in the day. But this is what I ultimately dig about this series: its ability to evolve with each new sequel. There's something oddly glorious about a franchise that used to be about bros and hungry people racing cars transforming into a franchise about those same people attempting to steal $100 million dollars from a vault by dragging the vault out of a building and through the streets of Rio, putting hundreds of people in harm's way.Now that is what I call entertainment!A great addition to Fast Five is Dwayne the Rock Johnson who is one of the most charismatic people on the entire planet. Seriously, you could give that guy a horrible script and he would turn it into gold. With Fast Five, he is given gold and turns it into a damn diamond; the guy is magic. He's one of the few examples (Dave Bautista being a new example) of a wrestler- turned-actor that has actually succeeded as an actor in the long run. With his most recent appearance at WrestleMania 31,Johnson is a figure that can both be a welcomed addition to a movie and then can be welcomed back into the squared circle the very next day. In Fast Five, the Rock steals the show whenever he shows up because he's such a great screen presence. It's almost possible to feel him in the background of each scene (that he's not in), working his way to finding and taking down Dom's Ten.He also gets an awesome fight scene with Vin which is the best fight scene in the franchised only matched by Vin and Jason statham's fight scene in furious 7. Without the Dwayne, I don't think Fast Five would have reached the astronomical heights that it managed to cross.Fast Five bounces around from action scene to action scene and in between these action scenes is where it fuses its great characters into its fairly entertaining story to deliver what I think is one of the most well-rounded packages of the entire franchise; it might even be the most well-rounded (at least so far). I mean, seriously, you got Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Tyrese, Ludicrous, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Gal Gadot, Tego Calderon, Don Omar, and Dwayne Johnson in the same movie; it's the Expendables of race car action movies. Fast Five also throws in a small bit of genuine emotion in one particular scene and it reminded me that this bonkers franchise is able to actually be sad from time to time. Who would've thunk it?The one thing that has always managed to stick around in my brain since seeing Fast Five for the first time, and what has become my group's tradition since then, is picking characters from the movie that we ""represent"". I, of course, picked Dom because I'm the leader of our group. My closest friend picked Brian, my other friend picked Han because he's cooler than the rest of us, and so on and so forth. Since the Fast and the Furious series has always been about family/friendship, I believe that us choosing the characters like we did gave us a stronger connection to the movie but also a stronger connection to each other; this was the movie that evolved the friendship of my group into a small family that ultimately changed us all forever.There's nothing stronger than the bond of family, and Fast Five really embraces that concept until it runs out of fuel and plummets off a cliff and into the waters below. It is also a life-changing movie and a damn fine example of how to mix action, characters, and emotion into one rollicking good package.",Tyson14,"Apr 7, 2015"
7,As A Whole Fast Five Was An Ok Fun And Entertaining Installment Despite Being The Weakest In The Franchise So Far,"It's hard to dislike Fast Five because the whole teams are back now, Han, Gal, and especially the likeable funny Tyrese who hasn't appeared since 2 Fast 2 Furious, those fun are unfortunately comes after the first weak and uninterested 40 minutes of the film, which wasn't garbage but i can absolutely skip it, Dwayne Johnson was a fine added, his fight with Vin Diesel was pretty exciting, the cop girl, Elena played just horribly by Elsa Pataky, the last action was a bit too long, and i also do think if it's not because of the team and it just another mission by Dom and Brian only it will not work, so Fast Five was definitely carried by the returning team, in terms of entertaiment i do mostly entertained, performances were also fine mostly, the rest of 90 minutes of the film was pretty good, as a whole Fast Five was an ok fun and entertaining installment despite being the weakest in the franchise so far.",HabibieHakim123,"Apr 13, 2023"

6,Flawed but still an improvement,"This was definitely the best entry in the franchise at this point. That doesn't mean that it blows the other films completely out of the water, just that this was better executed.",eadiony,"May 2, 2022"
10,This movie gives me goosebumps.,Fast Five best one from the franchise.The other ones we're very good too. I love Fast and Furious movies they we're always amazing for me. Now to the movie it is awesome movie because of the action.The action is just amazing and the cars are sweet. Testosterone Rock as a new one to the crew is perfect and good old Dome is just bad-ass and Brian he is just good.I liked that he has way more action then he had it the other movies.Paul Walker wasn't Oscar worthy actor but he did the job and i thing that he managed it very well especially the scenes where he rage in that way I think he's perfect. So the action is totally perfect acting is very good and dialogs are very good too. I love the movie.I love everything about it.It's just Mind blowing movie.,rehor-masarova,"Feb 16, 2015"
7,Ranks up right up there with the first one!,"Wow although being a huge 'mark' for Dwayne Johnson when he portrays The Rock in the WWE i have to say his movies as of late have been nothing less then sucky. Well that all changed tonight due his newest flick Fast Five. Dwayne definitely has stick this action genre and he will be OK in my book. He's cool he's muscular and has all the bows and ribbons of a bonified action star. Pair him up with the likes of Vin Diesel another actor who needs to stick to the action genre and you have what is a little over 2hrs of sheer packed fun. Although not being overly impressed with parts 2-4 this one ranks right up with the original only lacking in car races. Now i said car races not chases and this flick is filled with em. Most of the original regular cast (minus the ones who have been killed off in previous chapters) show up for this instalment and a few from the other sequels such as Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pierce (2fast2 furious) and Tej played by Ludicrous another 2 fast memory of sequels gone past. After reuniting with Vince (played once again by Matt Schulze) who is now living in Rio with his love interest and his child. Its not long before the old team are back at it this time putting their heads together to pull off a which leads to be a 'Ocean's 11' worthy heist of the big political villain who pretty much runs Rio Dejeinero, Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). Dwayne Johnson, like i said rounds off the cast playing the lead Marshall who has been hired to hunt down and arrest Dominic and his crew. Any fan of this series should really be happy with this latest instalment that really hasn't lost any of its staying power yet in my opinion in fact to the contrary its gained life. I could see them doing more of these.",thekyles99,"Apr 29, 2011"

No rating,The best of the series,"I love movies and have wanted to write a review for ages, only I didn't really see the point. I have avoided watching fast five for months because I thought it would be the same as the other sequels. I WAS WRONG! Fast five is one of the best, it has some of the best characters from the first four, Vin diesel reprises his fantastically cool character, and they also brought back my favourite person from Tokyo drift,Sung Kang AKA Han Lue. The Rock (who I ordinarily am not a fan of) gets introduced as a Kick ass cop.... Suffice to say its more action packed and less about cars than any of the others, I think they may of broke a record for least car races in the series :D I would now quite happily watch a sixth instalment of the series, fast five left me feeling happy and content in the knowledge that I had not just wasted 2 hours of my life.",vandangle2006,"Aug 27, 2011"
7,"good, but not the best...","The expectation is always great when is a film in the franchise F&F. All previous films were great, could not be different with ""Fast 5"". Yeah, it has many unrealistic scenes, but what makes this movie good are these exaggerated as the final scenes, where Brian and Don hold a multi-ton safe in their cars. The performances were great, as always, and the soundtrack is another great thing in the film. One of the few things I dislike in the plot was this not to be the last film in the franchise. Had a great end. But instead, we find something else to make a new movie. A good idea with the return of a character lost, but that could have been discarded. With a few races, forget it if expected a movie full of speed as 2 Fast 2 Furious. But for fans, it's a good chance to see three movie stars in action in a single movie.",petailss,"Nov 12, 2011"
9,There is just no stopping them!!!,No content,Method_Actor,"May 20, 2011"
6,This one depends on what you are looking for,"I was wondering when I would when the point where I think the movies should have stopped. For me, this is it. At this point the plot felt more like a Soap Opera in the sense that the plot was getting drug out far longer than it should be. What made this movie worse for me was the way they set up the return of some great characters, but then they seemed to abandon that storyline entirely for more scenes with Vin fighting the Rock or racing Paul Walker. This had so much potential being set in Rio and even ending in a heist, but they didn't even do that well. I had this rated as a 4 at first, but I had to give it an extra point considering the expectations of anyone actually watching this movie. Given the audience the audience and expectations, I suppose it met them, but nothing was exceeded. This fact is made even more disappointing by the budget they had for this movie I'm sure. Okay, this movie earned yet another star at the end, but I won't say why. I'm still surprised to see so many rating this as the best of the Franchise, I wouldn't agree with that, but I'm looking for more than Action in a movie.",jaredlemin,"Jan 30, 2025"
8,Unrestrained blockbuster fun,No content,Rickting,"Mar 16, 2014"
9,Fast 5 Certainly is Fast,"With the exception of Paul Walker's (as usual) terrible acting, Fast 5 has everything an action movie strives for; believable acting, humor (mostly from Tyrese), explosions, sexy women (and men for the ladies out there), exotic cars, destruction, and most importantly, full-throttled action that its predecessors couldn't come close to matching.The setting in Rio really showcases how beautiful the city is with spectacular aerial views thrown in on occasion to highlight it. Fast 5 is definitely the best of the Fast and Furious franchise, and it really isn't even close.",j-mersek,"Jul 5, 2011"
6,Coolest one in the series!,"After Fast and Furious was released in 2009, it was announced that Universal Studios would release a fifth film titled Fast Five in 2011, but this time the films would depart from the underground street-racing theme of the previous films and transforms the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By doing so, they hoped to attract wider with car culture and cars being used as a heavy emphasis.The plot follows the events of the last film with Dominic being transported to Lompoc Prison, but eventually is saved by Brian O'Conner and his sister, Mia Toretto as they hid in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. They plan a heist to steal $100 million dollars from corrupt businessman Hernan Reyes while being pursued by arrest US Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs.To me, this was the film that transformed this franchise from the underground racing-theme in the previous film to movies that has cars and girls and stuff. This was also the first film that features only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as gun fights, brawls and the heist of $100 million.The action is top-notch with the climactic car chase at the end of the film, which is the best climax in an action / comedy film ever made and created and I give credit to the director and the script writer for doing this.The music by Brian Tyler is just memorable and I'm not going to go into too much detail about his musical score for this film because he's also composed music for the fourth and fifth films in the Final Destination series and he has just finished composing music for the upcoming sequel Avengers: Age of Ultron, which hits theaters worldwide next Friday on May 1st, 2015.Now, I get to the acting. Vin Diesel returns as Dominic Toretto and he is really good. The same can definitely be said for Paul Walker & Jordana Brewster as Brian O'Conner and Mia Toretto. Sung Kang and Gal Gadot as Han Seoul-Oh & Gisele Yashar were wonderfully, especially Gal Gadot, who will be playing Wonder Woman in the upcoming Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice, which is set for release in March of next year.The film sees the return of Matt Schulze as Vince and he does a great job in the screen time that he has until he dies in the film, which is a sad moment. The film would also see the return of Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges as Tej Parker and Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pearce and they do a very great job and the comedy is just funny and the way they talk is just funny and amazing.The film introduces three new characters: Hernan Reyes, the main villain, played by Joaquim de Almeida, who does a very good job, but it took me a couple of re-watches to understand what the heck was saying. The second character introduce is Elena Neves, Hobbs' partner and Dominic's second love interest, played by Chris Hemsworth's wife, Elsa Pataky. She is just cool. Finally, the third character who would be introduced was Luke Hobbs, played by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and he performs the role fantastically. The fight between Dominic and Hobbs was fantastic and Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson took that scene really seriously.Overall, I simply love Fast Five. It blends action with comedy so brilliantly and awesome. The drama also works and it is really great. I give it a 6 out of 10, this might be a little bit low, but it definitely works for me.",joshuadrake-39480,"Apr 23, 2015"

No rating,Does What It Says On The Box,"A thinner script, a bigger stunts budget and a cast that is busting at the seams from all the muscle and machismo. It even has Joaquim de Almeida to chew the scenery as the proto-bad guy drug lord. It's a total paint-by-numbers Fast and Furious, but with everything cranked up to a ridiculous level (and a lot of the flab trimmed away). If the opening scene does not make you realise that using your brain is a drawback, you shouldn't watch Fast Five. But if you can switch off, it's a lot of fun (especially the totally unrealistic final action sequence). It's the action move that just keeps on giving. For fans there is a sense of conclusion to the characters, but who has been watching these for the story? Car porn and explosive action: that is pretty much this package. Sit back and enjoy.",jmcfrancis,"Oct 2, 2011"
7,Fast & Enjoyable,"For the fifth installment of the Fast & Furious series this installment wasn't half bad. In fact, I found it to be better than some of its predecessors.Fast Five has a great cast of misfits and they all come together nicely in this flick. This movie is very fast moving and doesn't waste a second jumping into the plot. Fast Five has a great combination of action, light humor, and even a wee-bit of suspense.I did find this movie to be highly predictable though, and unfortunately, this was not ""The Rock's"" best work. With that being said, despite its minor misgivings, Fast Five was highly entertaining, the cars/car driving was fabulous, and the chemistry among the actors is fantastic.",sehook7,"Oct 31, 2012"
8,awesome action in an awesome film,"I was not prepared for how good this film was going to be, I had avoided watching it after being disappointed with the rest of this series. HOWEVER you will be disappointed no longer as this film brings everything we have missed since the first. all the action and violence and comedy and general awesomeness. I managed to catch this film on a flight back from the states and it honestly made the flight go insanely fast. the film admittedly has some flaws and a OK story line but that is more than made up for with the rest of the film. and the final scene with the dodge chargers although a little unrealistic was no less one of the most awesome in history (no more on that or the film will be ruined). i can not say how impressed i was with this film after all the failures of its predecessorsROLL ON FAST 6!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1",jazzwoolf,"Aug 15, 2011"
7,Great Action movie for Fast & Furious fans,"Great action scenes, destroyed cars and mayhem. These words describe the movie best. More or less you know what's gonna happen at the end but there are key facts that this movie is a successor. The direction of the film is great, even in the most unrealistic scenes you can feel the tense in which case you feel certain that you're actually physically there. I think that the fun part begins on the second half of the movie. And of course I must not forget to mention the epic fight between Luke Hobbs ""The Rock"" & Vin Diesel ""XXX"". (I wish Luke Hobbs wore less Sun Tanning Lotion & Baby-Oil. A personal remark to Mr Hobbs: ""You look too shiny dude.. relax!! We know you got muscles!""). Besides some minor mistakes and some bad acting I think that this movie is worth watching.",sfetkos,"Dec 5, 2011"
10,Great Action Movie!,"The movie still has its feelings of brotherhood and contains a lot action and nice cars, although the movie misses street races, the nightlife of illegal street racing, like in the first and second fast and furious films. There are some mistakes in the storyline that disturbs me, however they are minor errors that are unlikely to be discovered (perhaps if you watch it more than 10 times, as I did). The movie in general I think is awesome, the action sequences and the humor that is, absolutely awesome. RIP Paul ... You will be missed, you did achieve a lot, inspired many! ...............................................................",milan97-164-884905,"Nov 19, 2014"
7,Excellent Movie - A must watch,"Excellent movie with as expected Great Hip Hop Music. The movie was pretty much up to the mark. Sexy Cars, Hot Chicks and a full fledge action pack; what else can you think about such titles.Loved the movie as a whole. Got a little bored in middle but climax was just outstanding, this movie is in a sequel to the previous F&F. Vin diesel as usual rocks, ""The Rock"" added a lot of spice to action. Guess What; Vin got a new girl friend. The best piece i liked was Dodge cars all over the movie and the best flick was when these guys actually stole the whole bank out of the building and tossing the traffic with that safe. GReat Idea...!",rishun-gupta,"May 13, 2011"
8,The Fast and the Furious has morphed into quite the little action series,"Before we get started, I want to get something off of my chest. For a long time, the Fast and the Furious franchise has been a big guilty pleasure of mine. Sure, they're silly, unrealistic, and way over the top, but they're fun, and exciting. Not ever cinematic experience has to mirror The English Patient. Sometimes I just want to see car chases, and sht blowing up. This series, despite it's many flaws, manages to provide the audience with enough eye candy and carnage to solidify it's spot in pop culture history. When the trailer premiered, and revealed to me that I would be seeing a host of returning characters, coupled with Dwayne Johnson versus Vin Diesel. I was on board instantly. I even learned that The Liberal Dead's own Ted Brown had a soft spot for the series as well. When I finally sat down to consume the new installment, my expectations were off the charts.Following the example that the previous film set, Fast Five is more of a crime/action flick, than another rice-a-roni car porn. Many people were not fans of the previous film, but I admired it for the direction that it took the franchise. It may sound silly, especially considering the material, but it almost felt like the franchise had matured. Whereas previous sequels tried to re-capture the flavor of the first film, focusing almost entirely on the cars, and the races, ""Fast and Furious"" revisited the original characters, and showed us what the events of their first romp has done to their lives. There's almost something magical and mysterious about the ending of the first film. It certainly romanticizes the fact that Brian let Dominic go, rather than bringing him to justice. But what are the consequences for everyone involved? These are the questions that were answered in the last film, and now expanded upon in series' return.Fast Five begins where the previous film concluded. Brian, now rogue from the FBI has rounded up a furious carpool to bust Dominic out of police custody. Living on the run in Rio, Brian and Mia reconnect with Vince, and try to pull off a heist to help get their heads above water. When Dominic shows up with the crime already in progress, he senses a double-cross, and alters the plan preventing the crew from meeting up with the man that hired them for the job. The man turns out to be the #1 kingpin in all of Rio, and he orchestrates a wide-net search party, including his own henchmen, as well as the majority of the local police, who happen to be on his payroll. Since several US federal agents where found dead in the aftermath of the robbery, a US Special Forces team is sent to apprehend Brian and Dominic, who they think are responsible for the deaths. Leading the team is Special Agent Hobbs, played by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson.The introduction of Hobbs as a character, pits two completely larger than life action heroes against one another. This not only appeals to the sensibilities of action fans across the globe, but it leads to one of the most exciting scenes of hand to hand combat in recent history. Dwayne and Vin have a terrific amount of on-screen chemistry, and could very easily go on to make movies outside of the F&F universe, both versus, as well as on the same side. Say what you want about either man, but both of them have several solid films under their belt. Hopefully the decision to put these two titans in the same film yields the obvious intended result, and Fast Five will end up dominating the box office.Enough characters return from the previous films to appeal to franchise fans, but the story and the situation generates crossover appeal as well. Even though it's a continuing story arch, anyone looking for a popcorn action flick can walk into the theater and walk out satisfied, even if you're completely unfamiliar with the four previous films.The Fast and the Furious has morphed into quite the little action series, and despite the satisfying amount of closure the film leaves you with, it also leaves just enough open so that a plethora of sequels are not only able to be produced and make sense in the context of this film, but have the potential to actually be enjoyable films. Fast and Furious has become the Saw of the action genre. The only difference being, I actually hope they make a couple more F&F films, especially after the scene that occurs after the end credits. I can't wait to see where they're going to take it from here.",Strawberry_Typhoon,"May 1, 2011"
6,"Ridiculous and dumb, but I guess I can see why some like this film","I have often heard people say that The Fast and Furious franchise starts off a bit slow, but they get much more fun at Fast Five. So, I made the jump from the first one all the way to the fifth to see if people were right. I figure if this chapter in the saga doesn't work for me then it's clear that none of them are going to be my cup of tea. I will admit that it is more fun watching these guys as big-time international thieves than just a bunch of street-racing punks who steal DVD players. It's always a blast to see the tropes of a heist movie as our heroes assemble their team, devise their plan, and then execute the plan (dealing with any bumps in the road as they go.) I didn't feel like I missed much in character development by skipping some of the movies. I just accepted that this team had grown closer, and moved up in the world from petty larceny to the point that they are pulling massive heists in non-extradition countries. It also seemed fairly obvious that they expected us to like them all despite the fact that they were convicted criminals on the run from the law. Finally, I understood the sly references to Tokyo Drift, because I've heard many times before that it takes place after these films.I do like some of what they are trying to do with the franchise in Fast Five, but I struggle with it as well because it feels like they are taking everything so seriously. This doesn't feel like a fantasy world, and yet these men and women are superhuman. They can survive anything, they never get shot, and we even watch Vin Diesel break a pair of metal restraints with nothing but brute strength. Also, I'm not a car guy, so all the time spent drooling over luxury sports cars and watching them race in circles was kind of dull for me. Plus, these aren't even real cars because they have supernatural powers just like their drivers. The big chase at the end is one of those things that is meant to be pure fun, but I was sitting there baffled that this made any logical sense. A fleet of semis couldn't pull that much weight at those speeds, let alone a couple of cars. Not to mention all the civilians that must have been killed by that huge thing swinging around as they raced down the street. So much for the family being good guys, they are mass murderers! It seems that Fast Five has proven, even when they make some improvements to their formula to increase the level of fun, the required suspension of disbelief (and interest in cars) is too much for me to enjoy.",blott2319-1,"Sep 25, 2020"
10,"You really wonder how any movie, of any genre, could be as good as this.","After 30+ years, and two weeks after watching this movie for the first time, I realized that this movie, for me, has just unseated Blade Runner. That's how I feel about the absolutely masterful film-making and care that went into this. I don't even want to talk about it - in fact, I can't. I've tried to write what exactly this film is here, and well, you can't summarize a kaleidoscope, now can you? So it can't be done here. Only in person, with a friend, or just watch this film, and look at everyone's expressions in this film, right down to the characters near the bottom of the cast list. Everybody is part of this film, and everybody looks like they are living it. And things left for the audience to figure out about the characters all add up to a great respect for the audience and for the idea of thoughtfulness itself. I said to my girlfriend, this movie is about as far from Mel Gibson in those Lethal Weapon movies, making those Three Stooges moves and then going crazy on someone, as any action movie is ever going to get. The darned movie even makes you want to be a better person. Go figure.",scasey,"Sep 2, 2013"

F&F 3 was rubbish already, badly cut, totally incoherent lousy acting and so on... Vin Diesel i do expect more of you!!!

No rating,Vintage and Clunker,"Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson): ""Alright, listen up. The men we're after are professional runners. We find them; we take them as a team and we bring them back. And above all else, we never ever let them get into cars.""Fast Five is all about cars as it was with the similarly-named Fast and Furious and The Fast and The Furious--muscle cars and muscled men pulling stunts like this improbable heist in Rio. The car chases are fun to watch, but the dialogue and acting are strictly clunkers.It's amusing to watch the film's beefiest heroes, Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson, go face to face and mano a mano for a few minutes, and the helicopter shots of Rio make an interesting travelogue, notwithstanding some time is spent in the grim favelas.But it's not even close to the cool of Danny Ocean's capers. The heist, involving a drug lord and a very safe safe, is a rehash of existing B movie capers with the racially-mixed characters coming from around the world to pull off the impossible . Brainless it is, with brawn aplenty and a few spectacular car scenes such as at the beginning when vintage cars are removed from a speeding train. If you like the chases, high testosterone fights, and hot babes: ENJOY!",JohnDeSando,"Apr 29, 2011"
7,Non-Stop Fun,"Immediately after Fast and Furious, Fast Five has the core gang helping bust Dom out of a stint in prison and then escape to Rio. Upon getting there they meet up with Vince from the first film and get into a lot of trouble, putting them in the sights of the kingpin of Rio crime as well as a federal agent, played by the Rock, who believes that Dom and O'Conner were responsible for the death of some DEA agents.We're back to the second film as far as the opening goes. Everyone's escaping the police and, once again, Brian is a turncoat and should never have been trusted in the first place. The group winds up obtaining a microchip containing the location of all the kingpin's money drops and leads them to set up a hit to get all the money. Pretty much the entire cast returns to do the job, including Tej, Roman, and Han.The movie starts heavy with great action and then slows down for the set-up of the heist. Typically this middle slump is where the films fall apart and become an exercise in waiting. But Fast Five is very enjoyable because of the return of all our favorite characters. These are still pretty bare-bones creations, but they play off each other well and lead to some fun banter.The Rock makes his debut in the Fast franchise and is excellent. He's exactly what you'd want for a hard federal agent. If anyone is a shining star in this film, it's Johnson.And unlike previous movies, the action in this film is entertaining and doesn't fall flat at any point. The final scene, in which two cars pull a bank vault through the streets of Rio, is absolutely ridiculous and stupid but it's the best scene the series has to offer so far.Fast Five changes the focus of the films from racing to being cheesy action movies. This is the point where traditional Fast fans started to turn away. But for me, this marks the beginning of something that could be good. I was thoroughly entertained and that's something I can't say about any of the other films. The focus has changed to a place it obviously should have been to start.Fast Five breaks the franchise out of the slog of mediocrity and gives it its first truly good film.",sn319,"Dec 6, 2014"
9,"Fast cars, fast drifts, hot women and many action scenes.","Fast cars, fast drifts, hot women and many action scenes. If that is what you like, Justin Lin's movie Fast and Furious 5, released in 2011 with Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson in the leading roles is the right choice for you. The movie starts with a continued scene from Fast and Furious 4, in which Dominic 'Dom' Toretto (Vin Diesel) is freed out of a prison bus by his friend Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and his sister Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster). Because the three are wanted now, they escape to the Favelas in Rio de Janeiro. Dom's brother Vince wants them to help him to steal cars out of a train. During this theft, the gang around Dominic Toretto shoots two CIA agents who guarded the cars. In one of the stolen cars, a Ford GT40, Dom Toretto finds a chip with a map of all the places in which Rio de Janeiro's biggest gangster, Reyes, hid his money. That is why Favela gangsters want Toretto and Co. to be killed. But also the CIA, led by Special Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), wants them to be imprisoned, because of the two agents they killed. Because Toretto and Co. know where all the money is hidden, they attack one of the places and burn all the 10 million dollars hidden there. Doing this, they hope that Reyes will bring all his money (100.000.000 $) to one place. The aim is to attack this one place and to get the 100 million dollars to buy their liberty. This movie is really exciting because of all the action scenes. All the actors do a really good job and, of course, they all drive great cars. But you can still laugh in this movie. Furthermore, the sound track of Fast and Furious 5 'Danza Kuduro' is a great work by Don Omar. by André A., Stefan D. and Tom K.",English-Class2014,"Apr 13, 2014"

8,"Arguably the best in the ""Fast and Furious"" series so far.","Firstly, this movie has proved yet again that the fast and furious series is incomplete without the ever so powerful appearance of Vin Diesel. It was a treat to watch two raging bulls Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson in a single movie, can't say who looked dominating because both have such awesome physiques. Paul Walker in the role of Brian'O'Conner was as always up to the mark though his chemistry with Jordana Brewster was not so good this time. There was also no apparent reason to cast Tego Calderon and Don Omar as they did not make the movie better at all. Although I was glad to witness the return of Sung Kang and the stunningly gorgeous Gal Gadot both of whom did utmost justice with their roles. Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous also did a good job and Rio, Brazil, the location in which the story is set gave tremendous opportunities for great action and car chase sequences with which the Director did a great job, the cinematography was too good and the background score was also nice. The two main advantages this movie had over its predecessors were:1) The presence of Vin Diesel with Dwayne Johnson and the impact it had on the audience.2) Totally awe-striking action sequences, they getting so much better with every sequel, both visually as well as conceptually.Overall, a great experience irrespective of whether you are a fan or not.Now waiting eagerly to hear news about the next part!!!",shreckk,"May 11, 2011"
6,Good,"Velozes e Furiosos 5: Operação Rio has moved from car racing to car theft action! Although being recorded in Rio will be the main criticism here, in fact, it is no less, except for Jordana Brewster who is the daughter of Brazilian in that sin ugly. Telling great action scenes a memorable clash between Vin Diesel and The Rock. It counted on all the casts of the previous movies and I really liked that, just in one part of the movie I didn't like why wasn't actor Sung Kang exactly what was needed? Not for me and you know why! I could have left for the next movies telling your story what it involved in Fast & Furious - Tokyo Challenge and then it would be great and so my movie rating is 6.0.Movie seen on April 2, 2019",mfellipecampos,"Nov 21, 2019"

You would think that after all the other four films that five would be pushing the sequel's too far. now i can see that, However ""Fast Five"" is by far the best one out of all of them. i guess because they have put much more money into this film, the budget was an estimated $125,000,000, the film was well advertised and people were more aware of this film coming to the cinema and there was a big ""hype"" about it coming out. I think the hype towards this film was the audience responding to all the characters from the previous films are now featured together as one ""big family"" and working together as a team to do this last job. This films got it all, comedy action thrill suspense, muscle and guns and girls in next to nothing washing beautiful cars, i mean seriously can anything top that? watch and see, yet another must see film and will rock your night at the cinema.",j-cahill-974-388388,"Dec 11, 2011"

9,Great: 9.0,"The Fast and the Furious series has, both to its credit and detriment, always stuck to its guns. The series has always been about one thing: racing fast cars driven by faster women (or is it the other way around?). This approach worked for the first movie because it was a different approach to the action genre, a B-movie exploitation thriller wrapped up in an A-movie shell of well-known actors and colorful special effects. After four of these movies, however, I don't think anyone will disagree when I say that the formula got more than a little old, culminating in the frankly dreadful Fast and Furious. Well, no longer. With series newcomer Dwayne Johnson, Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, and director Justin Lin leading the pack, the series has been transformed beyond the scope of its ancestry and into the strange new world of the B-movie thriller. One of the main problems with the franchise is that they all took themselves too seriously, always refusing to let themselves go, and thus remaining chained to what had gotten the series moving in the first place. Fast Five makes the long-overdue decision to drop over the edge, and emerges as the first truly great entry of the series, surpassing even the original in terms of sheer filmmaking quality. Justin Lin has some serious balls to change what had kept series diehards coming back. There is only one race scene, one. There are quite a few fight scenes to replace the racing, though, and these are pulled of in a gloriously over-the-top manner matched only by the Grindhouse films begun by Robert Rodriguez. Like those films (and unlike Fast 2-4), Fast Five fully embraces its ridiculousness and just runs with it. There are far more practical, realistic ways to do just about everything in this film. It would, of course, be more realistic to stop, then board, the bus carrying Dominic Toretto rather than somehow managing to make it flip by touching a 1970 Dodge Charger. Would it be as entertaining? No, probably not. There are many such scenes in this movie. It would take too long to go into detail on them, but suffice it to say, there are more than enough of them to make this film far and away the most entertaining of the series, as well as the funniest. Part of the fun of this movie comes from the so-bad-it's-goodness of the dialogue and stunts. Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson and Vin Diesel create a singularity of testosterone that makes any scene with them together an unmissable spectacle. And Johnson...is...good. For one of the first times in cinema history, The Rock fits into his role, and becomes a truly screen dominating figure. Unlike most action movies these days, this film focuses on the characters just as much as special effects, and makes you lean forward in your seat as they get closer to death, as opposed to sitting back to enjoy the pretty lights. This movie seems so overjoyed to be free that it seems to be too much of a B-movie at times. There are musical notes that rise to a fever pitch just before lines are spoken, there are Mexican standoffs aplenty, and the dialogue itself is entirely too cliched at times (""We need to assemble a team""). But this adds to the humorous side of the film, making for a multitude of genuine laugh-out-loud moments that help break up the intense action scenes. Between the dialogue and the explosions, the movie is paced extremely well, and never once will you be bored enough to turn your eyes from the screen, and if you do do this, then you're probably in the throes of mirth by that point. Besides the gonzo action sequences, this films draw is the actors, as almost every major character from the past F&F film makes an appearance here. The stars fit into their roles quite well, with each one adding their own special touch to a scene, be it a joke, quip, or intimidating glare. Overall, these characters seem more human than they did in the previous films, and this helps you get investing in their conversations and actually wanting to hear what they have to say, rather than just tuning it out, waiting for the next punch to be thrown or fireball to be ignited. This is the perfect film to open the summer floodgates with, and should not be disregarded solely on the basis of its less-than-impressive siblings.",StonedMagician,"Jul 26, 2019"
7,Better than expected,"I went into this movie not having seen any of the previous ones, and was pleasantly surprised to find a fairly good action movie. Lots of beautiful exotic sports cars and video game-like stunts using them to make crazy jumps and turns and chases. The shootout scenes weren't half bad either, with people realistically going down after being shot once instead of the usual routine in most action movies where everyone seems to be wearing heavy duty bullet-repellent suits on and it appears to be impossible to hit anyone despite hails of bullets in the air. Though some scenes admittedly do get rather ridiculous, with speeding cars skidding around a heavily populated city and yet everyone seems to get out of the way in time, but oh well. You have to give a certain amount of leeway to a movie like this to enjoy it. Vin Diesel and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson both turn in their standard tough guy performances, and I don't think fans of either one of them would be disappointed.For a pre-summer season action movie, it could have been a lot worse, and is a fun and light diversion.",quinnox-1,"May 17, 2011"

10,All Joined for the Fifth,"The Fast and Furious series has struck us once more with a fifth movie that just keeps getting better and better. New characters, new action, and new drama. Some might say this new action surpasses the laws of physics but is that necessarily a bad thing. What distinguishes this movie from the others is that this is the first movie that gathers the characters from the past movies to create one big team or ""family"". This action movie is not just defined as an action movie, it includes developments of relationships and the creation of new ones thus offering a satisfying mix of emotion and adrenaline. It also highlights the importance of family in difficult times. It has an amazing plot, amazing cast, the greatest development of a family, and surprising plot twists.Fast Five is the first movie that sets the franchise into a new direction. It introduces the franchise into a heist-driven plot where for the first time, the team must not only outrun the law but also outsmart the ruthless drug lord in Brazil, Hernan Reyes. This finally gives the characters a chance to flex their brains as well as their muscles.The casting for this movie could not have been better. You have Vin Diesel starring as the iconic Dominic Toretto, Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner, Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto, and the newest character Dwayne Johnson as Luke Hobbs. Which better men would you rather watch fighting on your screen than Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson. The movie does not only show the power of men fighting but it also showcases the power of women and their abilities through the characters Mia and Giselle.This movie has kept its viewers on the edge of their seats because of the different plot twists. With shocking car crashes, heists, and shootouts that serve as a heart-pounding moment. Every time you think their plan is going wrong or it's going to fail, in reality it would be going exactly as they wanted. It's entertaining to watch how their plan unfolds and then discover the tricks behind it.Fast five has not failed the franchise with its trademark of exhilarating car chases. It has also succeeded in developing its characters and giving the audience a deeper understanding of them. With the relationships growing, the fast family is finally born in Fast Five. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker continue to anchor the series with their charismatic presence, and their bromance is as endearing as ever. Including Jordana Brewster whose character is revealed pregnant in the beginning thus showing the importance of maintaining the family bond.If I were to direct this film, there is not one thing I would change. It's got the cast with the perfect chemistry, the perfect script, and the perfect stunts. Yes, the stunts don't abide the laws of physics, but isn't that the fun of it? Fast Five is a spectacular addition to the Fast and Furious series, delivering non-stop thrills, a charismatic cast, and a heist plot that stirs the franchise in a new direction. If you're a fan of fast cars, big explosions, and heart-pounding action, Fast Five is a must-see. Prepare yourself for a wild ride through the streets of Rio de Janeiro.",nayahaddad-33402,"Oct 6, 2023"
6,"Expectations low, check. Disappointment, well, no.","I've seen all the others so I was expecting nothing more and possibly less. I was not disappointed. Action, action and more action, YES! Acting, direction, story, ehh. Who cares: they destroyed more cars in 60 seconds than I ever thought possible. The Rock was in top physical condition compared to a flabby and fast aging Vin Diesel. The brawl was so darkly shot that I suppose they could have been naked mud wrestling and nobody would have been the wiser.Overall, fast and fun. Do not expect ANYONE to win ANY awards for ANYTHING that happened here; just let it flow over you. BTW, are foley artists retarded? Beer in a bottle being tipped back for a drink does not sound like a half-filled bottle of water being inverted. And, not every motion has to have some artificial sound effect attached to it. Much more satisfying is the slight sucking sound as the bottle leaves the lips and a mild belch following. Pullleeez.Ciao, babies.",dariansdad,"Dec 1, 2011"
10,"Fast Five: A Cinematic Masterpiece of Speed, Heist, and Heart","""Fast Five"" (2011) doesn't just push the envelope; it tears it to shreds and leaves you exhilarated, breathless, and utterly captivated.

6,A satisfying way to spend two hours with your brain on auto pilot,"Usually, the fifth instalment of a long-running franchise is a re- hash of what made the original so popular, becoming increasingly tiresome in the process. 2009's fourth entry, Fast & Furious, which saw the core cast members return from a two film hiatus, was surprisingly fun, being less about flashy cars, nameless gyrators and the underground world of street racing, and focused more on the 'family' of criminals to whom the plot was centred around. Returning director Justin Lin, who has been on board since 2006's Tokyo Drift, continues this idea and makes a movie more exciting and action- packed than the one's that came before.After rescuing their friend Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) from a lengthy jail term, Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) and his girlfriend Mia (Jordana Brewster) flee to Rio de Janeiro to evade capture. Whilst they await the arrival of Dom, they pull a job with old acquaintance Vince (Matt Schulze), from the first movie, capturing a set of cars seized by the D.E.A. on their way, by train, to the U.S. When they discover that two of their crew are only interested in one car, Dom - who arrives mid-heist - gets Mia to steal it herself and the rest barely escape with their lives. The car turns out to be the property of drug lord Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), and contains a microchip detailing the whereabouts of his $100 million fortune.In an attempt to open the franchise up to a wider audience, Fast Five sees the series change from underground street racing and petty criminality to full-on fisticuff action, bagging a huge ensemble to support it's aspirations to be a heist movie. And it works. This is still stuff of the cheesiest variety, ignoring the laws of physics and asking us to suspend our beliefs far too often, but the idea of these criminals - who evolve into Robin Hood-types - who help each other like a family is nice. Lin brings back familiar faces Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges), Han (Sung Kang), and Gisele (Gal Gadot), but it's a newcomer that steals the show.As Hobbs, the enormous, baby-oiled D.S.S. agent assigned to capture Dom and his crew, Dwayne Johnson proves to be a great addition. With his ridiculous size, he's a credible threat to the likes of Dom, and their scenes together, including one inevitable smack-down, are laced with testosterone and a bit of humour, two things that Johnson does remarkably well. The main set-piece involves two cars dragging a stolen safe through the city streets, leaving a wave of destruction in their path. It's a gleefully ridiculous climax, and Lin proves himself wise by using minimal CGI. It doesn't break any boundaries or offer anything new to the genre, but it's a satisfying way to spend two hours with your brain on auto pilot mode.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",tomgillespie2002,"Feb 9, 2015"
1,Why would anyone want to watch this,"It is the same thing as all of the Fast Furious films, completely against gravity and reality, for all you people who thought it was a good film watch crossroads, for you young people who don't know any better watch Ronin. The characters still think they are the bees knees for driving fast, any idiot can drive fast going in a straight line, the train stunt I think the character brian would have been safer just to jump and roll on the ground rather than drive a car an jump into a cannon, its things like these scenes that get very stupid people killed. The scene with the safe and the two cars going down main street of Rio, come on how the hell could it happen, watch top gear with Jermey Clarkson drive a evo towing a camper van as fast as they can, engine pistons come flying through the engine head and the camper van is on wheels not dragged. Everything with this film is wrong and is completely stupid. I was ashamed with IMDb and the users reviews. Probably the only good thing about the film is the two new actors who play the Brazilian brothers with there constant bickering. Please stop making these films or else try and make them somewhat believable. PS don't go to the cinema to see this!",Eoinloughlin4,"Apr 25, 2011"

7,moves away from street racing to a real action flick,"I only though that it could go downhill with the franchise but I can say that this was another great entry. Maybe some will have difficulty with the idea that the street races are a bit left out of this flick and the story sometimes is a bit exaggerated. The gang surrounding Don (Vin Diesel) are almost fighting against the world but the franchise had to fight against other spectacular flicks (the ocean series a bit like this concerning old friends) so they decided to move a bit further with great effects and some nice stunts with cars. In fact this is just a reunion of characters seen in earlier entries but this flick also brought in Dwayne Johnson (Luke Hobbs). Of course you could see from the beginning that he and Don should have a fight man against man and they did. Also from now on you should have seen the earlier flicks to understand who's who and what their specialities are. There are enough flicks in this genre but for me the use of the cars gave it an extra thing to watch. Even this time we do have some goofy situations between the characters that gives it also something to watch. To say it's the best so far I can't really say because this one moves away from street car racing towards a really action flick. And it do has a lot of action. There is a part were things drop down a bit after halfway through the flick but the ending delivers the goods again. And to be honest, Vin isn't the best here. Were he carried part 4 here Dwayne is taking over, Vin has a few clichés to add but still, a great flick. Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",trashgang,"Sep 26, 2013"
9,Still my second favourite of all of them,"My favourite is still the first movie, because there would be no others without it. Part 2 is good, Tokyo Drift is ok, and part 4 is the most forgettable. So the series was going downhill fast, but came way back up for this one. I originally saw it in Imax which is the best way to see it with the scenery of Rio. Awesome action, crazy car scenes and a vigorous shot of adrenaline from The Rock that really helped out the series.",funtasticfour,"Jul 10, 2019"
7,Racing fades into the background.,"Fast Five. Racing fades into the background. It is probably from this part of the Fast & Furious series that they move from films about racing to action films. But it's still insanely spectacular and some scenes even fascinate the eye. New and old characters fit well into the new story and are in excellent contact with each other (throwing jokes to each other or comparing who has a car faster). Musically, this episode was not so memorable, except for ""Danza Kuduro"" by Don Omar and Lucenzo, no other song comes to mind. Speaking about the plot, it is not as interesting as it was in part 4, and the plot ""we need money and we will rob a rich uncle"" does not go very well.",kelvinselimor,"Sep 2, 2022"

7,"The action is awesome, but who cares about the plot?","Back in 2001 The Fast and the Furious was released in cinema and was a hit; but who would have thought this series would have lasted for five films, with at least two more on the way. Even more surprising is that the fifth film of the series is considered the best of the series.Fast Five starts where Fast & Furious left off, with Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) breaking Dominic (Vin Diesel) out of a prison and the three flee to Rio de Janeiro. Running low on cash Brian and Mia agree to do rob cars from the DEA on a train but end up crossing crime lord Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) who controls the Favelas of the city. With information about Reyes' operation, the trio form a team to make on of the most audacious robberies imaginable. But on their trial is Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), a Diplomatic Security Service agent sent by the FBI to bring Brian and Dominic back to America.Because of the success of the previous three films, Justin Lin has become a in demand director, being linked to The Wolverine and reboot of The Terminator and Highlander. He certainly shows he is a good action director, delivering solid action sequences like the early train robbery, the shootout and chase in the Favelas and the car chase in the city. They are crisp, well edited, fun and have physicality because of use of practical effects and stunt work. They were easily the best parts of the film, alone with Johnson's show stealing performance. He had the best lines and he has the charisma and physique to be threat. He was funny and this is the type of film Johnson should be doing instead of the family comedies he has been doing. The film needed more of him.Acting has never been a strong point of the series and fans want to see action sequences and car races/chases. Diesel is a decent action lead, he is certainly convincing during action scenes against Johnson. Brewster, Walker and Sung Kang are okay if a little flat. Tyresse Gibson is still annoying but is not quite the idiot he was in 2 Fast 2 Furious. Just do not expect any acting master classes. Though de Almeida is oily as ever.Plot and writing are fairly thin throughout. Fast Five is a heist film where they want to rob a big bad gangster whilst trying to avoid getting arrest themselves. The big twist is that they use muscle cars for the robbery. Originally Fast Five started life as a sequel to the remake of The Italian Job but obviously evolved into a Fast and Furious sequel. It is your typical heist film, a crew is assembled, they make their preparations and follow the mark or scan locations, etc. But there are some silly moments, from making out the heroes are Robin Hood figures but never really expand on it and show they want the money for themselves and not giving it to the poor. There are moments showing that the characters to be a bit stupid, such as racing in police cars when they were meant to be uncover (and coming to that shouldn't police cars be very difficult to rob) and when they steal the safe of money it causes millions of dollars of damage and possibly would have killed about a dozen people. A more serious criticism is considering the material the running time Fast Five is too long for what it is, compared to say X-Men: First Class which needed the same running time or Rise of the Planet of the Apes which fitted in more in less. A running time of about 1 hour 45 minutes would have been more fitting. There also the typical leery nature of filming women focusing on their breasts and butts, there was even a plot point based on this. This is just fan services for a young male crowd. Finally the humour does fall flat and the film should have been played a bit more straight.There are fun moments, certainly good action films and I do wish more films used practical effects these days. The plot is a little silly at times, it is over the top, but there are plenty of films from the 80s like that. It is not a great film but it is easy viewing.",freemantle_uk,"Apr 8, 2012"

10,Fast Five has a great set of characters and is action packed from start to finish - My Ultimate Review,"Fast Five or Fast & Furious 5: Rio Heist as it's also known as, it's the third Fast & Furious film Justin Lin have directed and it's once again written by Chris Morgan. This installment gets the franchise to the action and roots that made me fall in love with the Fast films, gripping and suspenseful action sequences that make you sit at the edge of your seat. The focus on heists is the right move, they make it brilliant and entertaining, how a box office hit should be and succeeded. I won't lie the logic in these movies disappear more and more but they are entertaining. Having this movie take place in Brazil and Rio was an excellent choice. Also the cast and likeable characters are all memorable. Justin Lin's direction is one of the highlights in Fast Five, absolutely amazing. Chris Morgan's story and script is a huge step forward than the previous film, he did a great job. The dialogue was at times below average but I don't mind bad dialogue if the characters and actors execution is good and they are.Fast Five continues where the previous film left off. It follows Dominic Toretto, Brian O'Conner and their team as they plan a heist to steal $100 million from corrupt businessman Hernan Reyes while being pursued for arrest by U. S. Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs. The ensemble cast has Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang, Tego Calderon and Gal Gadot. The new additions are Dwayne Johnson as Luke Hobbs, Joaquim de Almeida as Hernan Reyes and Elsa Pataky as Elena Neves. The new cast members are appreciated and so is the returning cast.On the technical side of things, they really outdid themselves. The quality have gone up on every aspect, sound editing and the whole production. The editing still amazes me, action sequences and non action ones. The pacing is fast and fits perfectly with the film. The cinematography have improved too, I still love the camera work and how they edit the car sequences, truly masterly done by them.What I truly love about this film is how they use practical effect and all the stunts, Paul Walker did all of his stunts and I'm sure Vin Diesel did too. The stunt involving the flatbed truck slamming into the moving train was filmed practically, if I remember correctly the last sequence involving the bank vault was also done practically or at least most of it. The action feels real and it's thanks to the stunt coordinator and stuntmen.What the Fast Saga does well is that it never slows down, movies about cars should only get faster and Fast and Furious will never slow down. After many viewings, I still love this film. Dare I even say that it's one of my favorite action films.",Holt344,"Jun 11, 2021"
7,Incredible action!,"'Fast Five' follows directly on 'Fast and the Furious 4', and this time it's war!Justin Lin is once again back as director. Most of the regular cast is back. Enter Dwayne Johnson, as Hobbs. Gal Gadot - who made her appearance in 'Fast & Furious' - is back as well; this time as part of Dom's team. Vince is also back, after a 3-film absence. Wow, the male actors were like a muscle exhibition!The opening bus crash scene sent warning signs to my brain, telling me the action was going to be overdone and unrealistic. Fortunately, this was not the case. Instead, the action sequences were very well choreographed and incredible. The vault scene, especially, is nothing short of spectacular. It was awesome seeing the vault causing so much chaos and mayhem. Unlike anything I've ever seen! The action in general - even the fighting scenes - were fast-paced and no holds barred.The amazing cars of the previous films are no longer the main attraction. The car races are merely here to make up time and doesn't really play a role anymore. 'Fast Five' is a heist film, and more hi-tech than its predecessors. 'Fast Five' is one of the best entries in the series.",paulclaassen,"Jul 26, 2020"
9,I'm shocked by how good this is.,"I would like to formally apologize for giving this a rating of 3/5 six years ago. It was the only Fast and Furious movie I'd seen at that point, and I thought it was just disposable, stupid fun... but also kind of boring in places. Watching it after getting through the previous four movies in order... this one is close to amazing. I can't lie. It brings together all the main supporting and lead characters from the past four in such a fun way. They really do feel like a ""family"" (I know about the memes, but it feels genuine here).Throughout this watch-through of the series, seeing most for the first time, I was anticipating the point when the series cast aside car races and became action schlock, and now, it's clear that Fast Five is the point where that transition happens. And what wonderful, stupid, mindless, entertaining schlock it is. So comically macho, so over-the-top, so consistently devoid of anything boring. There's a part of my brain that rejects the stupidity, but most of my brain doesn't care, and just submits. I sort of loved this one. An action movie classic. Non-stop, dopey, and kind of self-aware without being cloying or overdone about it. Vin Diesel, who I've called a charisma vacuum before... I liked him here. He was perfectly utilized. Seeing everyone else come back was great. The new characters were generally fun (especially The (Sweaty) Rock). Shifting away from car racing and turning this whole thing into a ridiculous heist movie was such a good move.I get the hype, now. Watching this one out of context a while back, it felt like a passable movie, but seeing the series build towards this - following it all along the way - was shockingly satisfying. I believe this one's considered the high point of the series, and that's okay with me. This is a ridiculously fun movie. It's shallow as hell and not particularly clever, but it delivers meaty fun, rarely subjects you to a dull moment, and has a handful of incredible action sequences (the one in the opening and then the climax are the two best from the series so far). This is, for the most part, awesome. And I can't believe I'm saying that. I get it!",Jeremy_Urquhart,"Jul 27, 2024"

7,A fun popcorn movie that is full of improbable,"I watched Thor last weekend. A comic book movie with other universes, and I think there are more plot devices in Fast Five that requires the audience to suspend logic than there are in Thor! Not trying to do a spoiler post here, so I won't go in to them. Its the kind of big action, big Ka-pow movie that the audience doesn't want to get bogged down in the details on if they just want to have fun. (Where's all the money for stuff coming from, how'd that car do that, federal agents really have that on their computers, very rich criminals would really do that?) Ha. Don't sweat the details and its a good movie to romp around with.",rcnaylor,"May 16, 2011"
8,The best in the franchise and its the FIFTH movie. That's impressive; Would Recommend,"Directed by Justin LinStarring Paul Walker, Vin Disel and Dwayne JohnsonPlot Overview: ​Ever since ex-cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and Mia Torretto (Jordana Brewster) broke her brother Dom (Vin Diesel) out of custody, they've traveled border to border to evade authorities. In Rio de Janeiro, they must do one final job before they can gain their freedom for good. Assembling their elite team of car racers, Brian and Dom know they must confront the corrupt businessman who wants them dead, before the federal agent (Dwayne Johnson) on their trail finds them.Very rarely is a sequel better than its predecessor. It's nigh impossible for the third to hold up. The fourth being good is rare. The FIFTH being the BEST is unheard off and is a testament to how enjoyable this movie is. It was birth of a new franchise and set the precedent for how these movies have gone. It has the best acting in the franchise, arguably the best story and is by far the funnest movie in the franchise. The action in this movie is amazing and the finale is just awesome. I definitely recommend you watch this movie; it is awesome.The story was basic but served its purpose. It's a really good heist movie and is stupidly enjoyable. The ending was also amazing and, while it did follow Heist movie clichés, it followed them well and made them work.Paul Walker was alright as Brian O'Connor and Vin Disel, for the first time in his entire career, showed ACTUAL EMOTION in a character. I mean if this movie can do that then that warrants a watch. Jordana Brewster was good as Mia. I don't buy that O'Connor, Torretto and Mia would do what they do. Their motives were pretty weak for the movie. Dwayne Johnson was amazing as Hobbs and revitalised the entire franchise. If you ditched this franchise before this movie, Johnson made this franchise go from 0-60 in less than a second of his performance. Tyrese Gibson was OK as Roman Pierce but he still plays the same annoying character in EVERY SINGLE ONE OF HIS MOVIES!!!! Ludicrous was alright as Tej as was Sung Kang as Han. Gal Gadot was fine as Gisele. Elsa Patansky was also alright as Elena Neves. Something I will say is that while characters like Torretto and Hobbs got plenty of screen time, characters like Han and Tej were left in the dust and had little to no development. I also don't believe that Hobbs would switch sides like that. The villain was also insanely weak and was just terrible.The cinematography was fine and I could actually see which was much better than 4. The effects were also pretty good and blended well with the actual movie. This movie was an all around fun movie and was insanely enjoyable. It needed to improve on its cinematography from 4, which it succeeded but also needed to improve on its villain, which it failed.In conclusion, this movie was so enjoyable and is easily the best movie in the entire franchise. If you haven't seen this movie, I definitely recommend it because it is just great fun.8/10Would Recommend",EthanBJones_03,"May 16, 2017"

1,So wrong!!!,"My opinion.. This movie was so bad!! Not worth 1 star.. If it wasn't for all the sexualizing of women and all the girls in revealing clothes walking around zooming in on girls it may have been a half decent movie, anorexic looking girls in skimpy outfits half the movie is all about.. It just doesn't do it for me.. It's just wrong.. If you they need to use that much crap in it for it to get ratings well it mustn't be that good.. I thought it was awful!!!I can't wait to see a movie where they have guys walking around in G Strings the whole time.. Zooming up on their privates.. You almost never see that.. It's just getting tiring.. It definitely could have been better without the girls!!",bellaperfection,"Sep 13, 2011"
7,We finally get good five in,"Five films in and at first it feels like yet again we are in for the same old Fast and Furious, races galore and dumb dialogue which makes a movie that could be good, bad. Something has happened though because Fast Five is actually a good movie and I really mean that, not only is the plot exciting and full of action packed and well done sequences, it also actually builds the characters so you don't feel they are disposable cast members and sure the film gets rid of races every few minutes but that is where the good stuff lies, the fact that this has very little racing. The movie tries it's hardest to keep the cars cool but then make the story a movie full of guns and full of emotional back stories etc, it partly works and maybe can be a little shaky with those emotional parts but all in all you still feel a slight connection and that is what truly counts in the end.The story takes us to Brazil and the crew of Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) are as always, in trouble. This time the story takes us in a direction of heists and getting in and out of places fast, sure the stakes are seemingly impossibly high and the police of Rio de Janeiro are very unbelievable but the movie still navigates it's way well and creates a sense of danger at every turn. By far the best addition to the movie is Dwayne Johnson who plays the role of tough US security service agent Luke Hobbs, he literally looks like a human bull at times in this and his character is made out to be a man of the law, but a man who doesn't let anything get in his way. Now Justin Lin for me personally has failed to direct well at all with his previous instalments in the series, here he takes a whole new turn and makes a tip-top piece of work. The movie benefits from the fast pace because it doesn't hang about, the plot isn't maybe the most unique but the development that I feel Lin gives to the characters is good enough for this to really work. Chris Morgan's script is OK I mean at times it gets a little same old but it still manages to bang out a story and some snappy dialogue to make you feel like seeing this through, certainly tries very hard with the one liners in this one. I felt the main cast we know from the past like Paul Walker and Vin Diesel were alright, they were not the reason this movie is good but they do their parts and get them done pretty nicely. We see some other old faces from the past movies and that really plays into the whole story well, sure it is trying a lot to make itself look cool that way but it does work and it is a welcome sight to see some of the faces of old. The setting was a nice choice I have to add, the small cramped housing provides a perfect back drop and interior settings for some of the films biggest moments, a particular part running across the roofs of those buildings is fantastically shot. So a worthy addition to the furious franchise that seems to still be chugging a long, grossing in bucket loads of cash and breaking records at every corner. I hope that we see more of what this film is like in the future of this series, I don't mean go with the heist format again but lose the cars as racing tools and this comes off well, start to inject a little more depth and you have yourself an exciting but emotionally charged movie that not only fans of the series can enjoy, but also those who really do not like the ones that came before this one too.",willcundallreview,"Oct 16, 2015"
8,combine it all,"Awesome movie. Entertaining to the max. Good continuation of the story with lots of good connections to the past ones. Was awesome to see characters from all 4 previous movies meet for the first time. Amazing action of all sorts, racing, shooting, fighting, chasing. So many crazy scenes and omg moments. Also had some stupid stuff as expected, and what's up with vin diesel's voice lol (5 viewings, 6/19/2021)",FeastMode,"Jun 25, 2019"
7,The best of the Five,"¨I suggest you make peace with whatever demons you have left cause come tomorrow, I will find you.¨ The Fast and the Furious franchise is back with its fifth installment, Fast Five, and I must say this is probably the best one of the series. Almost all the characters from the previous films are back and director Justin Lin has managed to bring the franchise back to life. I thought Tokyo Drift would definitely bury the series without Vin Diesel or Paul Walker, but then they managed to bring all the main characters back, mix them together, and now it seems we will have plenty more fast cars coming our way. The screenplay was written by Chris Morgan, who also wrote the third and fourth ones, and the story works really well although that isn't the reason why we go see these movies. There are probably better actors, better scripts, and more believable heist thrillers than this one, but we still go see these movies for the cars and the great action sequences. The situations these guys go through is unbelievable, we know that the way these characters drive they should all have died in the first Fast and Furious, but we know this is just a fun and entertaining franchise and we try to make peace with the screenplay as best we can because it is just fun to see these guys go at it. It's fun to see them drive cars off a running train, or speed by busy streets without crashing into each other while at the same time avoiding all sorts of bullets and explosions. Fast Five might be the most unbelievable and improbable film of the franchise, but it is still the best one.The film picks up right where the fourth one left us, Brian (Paul Walker) and Mia (Jordana Brewster) are breaking Dominic (Vin Diesel) out of custody while he is being transported to jail. They successfully manage to free him, and all three of them become fugitives. They are forced to continually be on the run and end up in Rio de Janeiro with very little money left on them. In Rio they stay with Dom's longtime friend from the first film, Vince (Matt Schulze), who is now living in the favelas with his girlfriend and baby boy Nico. Vince tells Brian he has a job for them and since they are short on cash they have to accept. Unfortunately something goes wrong in the job and the guys make a new enemy: Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), a corrupt businessman who owns the entire police force and gangsters in Rio. Now Dom and Brian have all the gangsters, the Brazilian police, and special Federal Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ¨The Rock¨ Johnson) along with his elite team after them in beautiful Rio. Dom and Brian decide to pull off one last job in order to teach Hernan a lesson, but in order to do so they will need to assemble an elite team. That is where the rest of the crew from previous films come in. First we have Tej (Ludicrous) and Roman (Tyrese Gibson) from the first sequel, then there's Han Lue (Sung Jang) from the Tokyo Drift film, and finally Gisele (Gal Gadot), Tego (Tego Calderon), and Rico Santos (Don Omar) are back from the latest installment. Together they hope to pull off one of the biggest heists of their lives worth 100 million dollars, but being able to pull it off doesn't seem that easy.Fast Five delivers what it promises and even more. There are a lot of action sequences and they are shot extremely well. The cars move really fast, but that isn't all Fast Five has going for it. The addition of The Rock to the story sets up an interesting fight scene between him and Dominic. The Rock helped boost the series even more and brought something fresh to the franchise. There is also the plus that the film took place in Rio de Janeiro and the scenery there is just so beautiful. There is a great chase scene that takes place over the roofs of the favelas, reminiscent of the Bourne Ultimatum scene in Morocco. Yes, the story is improbable, but we still are allowed to have fun with it. I didn't get into the movie that much until the second half of the film, but let me say that the second part really delivers. This movie also has the best ending and it really leaves you expecting the sixth part, which I really didn't feel that excited about in the other films. Fans of the franchise will surely be satisfied and Fast Five might even add a few new converts along the way because it is the best one so far. The soundtrack is also great and Don Omar really is hilarious in this movie. He delivered most of the funny scenes in the film. Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson also did their part in sharing the workload. It was just good seeing all these characters together and the cameo in the ending is just the cherry on the pie. I was surprisingly entertained with Fast Five.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",estebangonzalez10,"May 17, 2011"
10,Great ride!,"Greetings from Lithuania.This is the best action movie so far in 2011, hands down. Action sequences are UNBELIEVABLE in every meaning of this word. Plot? Nothing new here, but it works. Acting is OK, especially from Dwayne Johnson - he simply rocks in this one! What i liked the most in ""Fast Five"" that action sequences doesn't use CGI, or uses it where it's only necessary. Stunts are ""crazy"" in ""Fast Five"" - in a god way. And that is what makes action seq. in ""Fast Five"" look AMAZING - You have to see it on a big screen. Really looking forward to ""F&F6""!9/10.",851222,"Jun 26, 2011"
6,The longest and brainless yet! Also the best,"Finally, on 2011 they went all super-hero (or anti-hero, really).And that went well for the series because it meant less emotional/character driven scenes (there are a handful of 2 minutes ""scenes"" of such kind, and while bad, they are there just to explain the motivations of the characters).The one thing that made this one better than the original is that there is a more ""Ocean's Eleven"" kind of plot, and even if you do have to turn your brain off to enjoy it, it works and its more elaborated than the others of the franchise.Again, not even a bit realistic at anything, but it doesn't really try to be, in my opinion. Less races and more chases with more action improved this thing.",educallejero,"Mar 27, 2019"
9,A flawless Fast & Furious film!,"The fifth installment in the Fast & Furious franchise perfects the formula in what many consider to be the best entry in the series. Picking right up where the previous film left off, Fast Five is balls to the wall action from the opening shot. An over arching heist plot is the perfect premise for the franchise at the time, keeping it simple while giving it flexibility to continue flying above the shark.The Rock slips into the series seamlessly, harnessing aspects of his wrestling persona into a great performance as Hobbs. He is a refreshing antagonist for being a brutish law enforcer type instead of the usual street gang leader. The Family is in prime form in this film, bringing back past characters for THE high-stakes heist.",mediatation,"Jun 21, 2024"

6,"Still a fun entry, but beginning to go beyond plausibility","Once Fast & Furious (2009) came back on the scene, reuniting Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and the rest of his crew, knowing sequels were on the way was more than just foresight. The hints were given not only with films prior, but also with teaser footage in the post credits. Amazingly, it has also been one of the few franchises that keeps on going no matter what critics have said previously. However, this is the film that not only topped all of the other installments and was favored the most by critics, but also began to bring the franchise full circle (kind of). Continuing immediately after the last film, O'Conner and his crew break out Dominic Toretto and flee to Brazil. Nonetheless, this does not stop the US government from sending another federal lawman to bring in O'Conner and Toretto. His name is Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), and he's determined to get the job done that O'Conner failed to do time and again.Once in Brazil, Toretto and Co. decide that the only way to be free of all the trouble they've been in for for the last number of films is to rob Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), a drug lord who controls the local area and use his money to disappear entirely. To do this, O'Conner and Toretto call in their contacts, which span from the prior sequels. Joining the gang is Roman Pierce (Tyrese Gibson), Tej Parker (Ludacris), Han (Sung Kang) and others. The great thing is, the fans of the franchise will definitely enjoy seeing the characters combine forces from beginning to end. Screenwriter Chris Morgan has certainly been improving the way the stories are being told for these characters. My question is since Morgan only began writing for the franchise at The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006), did he plan this from that point? If so, he certainly knows how to plan ahead.Sadly for timeline continuity, Chris Morgan still hasn't made any sense to why The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) was written first if that came later. It gets annoying to think about when trying to make sense of it all. To be honest though, the best part about Morgan's screenplay to this entry is the fact that it no longer focuses on revenge, trying to pick sides or anything near that. It's all about breaking free from old chains and it's something everyone strives for in life. There's nothing to say about acting because anyone watching this movie has either followed this franchise from the start or will become attached from here. All the actors maintained their characters charm and personality. It is surprising to see how some of the actors look now though. A lot of the male actors have beefed up considerably, from Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson and Matt Schulze. They got huge! Another impressive visual component is that the cars used are no longer on a high color pallet with neon paint and LED lights made to look and sound like your regular urban crotch rocket. Here, they use slick, dark colored, modern high performance cars and it looks less infantile in style and that's good. The action / racing is another good element that entertains to a point. I say this because at some points in the movie, the physics do not exactly apply and because this is in a ""real-world"" setting, what happens in some action scenes aren't the most plausible. There's only so much strain a regular car chassis can handle compared to a van or compared to a truck. Another thing that might annoy people depending on ethnicity is that no subtitles are used for when people speak in foreign languages. It's one thing if its brief but it happens more than enough times for people who are not fluent in the language to get confused. The final visual aspect to the film is Stephen F. Windon's cinematography. Considering that he's been on board this franchise since The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006), it seems that he knows what to look for as well. Plus, since this is a car-related movie, one would need a nice backdrop for viewers to look at while things are going on and that's what Windon does here. Much of his shots include beautiful scenery of the Brazilian landscape; from the mountains to urban terrain. Finally, completing the listening experience is Brian Tyler's musical composition. Like much of the other music he produced for the prior entries, again going back to The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006), it's fairly generic music. However, Tyler is able to convey the right tunes for the sentimental moments and action cues. To do this, like he's done in the past, he's used a mix of electronic synths and an actual orchestra. So far, he's doing a good job but hopefully he'll make a more memorable theme for the franchise at some point.Viewers should enjoy the direction in which their favorite characters go from here. Plus, rejoining the cast from prior entries, adding new characters and maturing the visual style is an added bonus. The only quip fans may have are the omitted subtitles and the action does entertain, but may get a bit out of control for its realistic setting.",breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,"Jan 15, 2015"
2,Among the worst I've ever seen,"I love heist movies. I love action movies. This film was utterly boring and unbelievable from start to finish. It defies the laws of logic, storytelling, and physics at every turn and it just goes on and on and on. And so predictable--especially if you've seen Oceans 11.I almost walked out during the ""climactic"" final chase. Such a snoozefest.The dialogue and stunts are laughable--and the mayhem and destruction in the last 30 minutes are numbing and unbearable. You keep looking, asking ""Where are all the bodies? There must be hundreds or thousands of people killed during this chase."" But nope, you don't see any bodies because there aren't any. No people on the streets of Rio during broad daylight even though in every previous shot the streets were jammed with pedestrians. My god this film was boring. It's the first film I've seen in Imax and it'll probably be the last-- seems pretty clear that's just a marketing scam to get people to see movies that would otherwise tank. I'm sure you'll ignore my review and see it anyway. That's cool, but bring a good book.",vsdobbs,"May 13, 2011"
6,Decent...but,"I don't know all the backstory of this franchise, but I enjoyed this movie for the most part. It was action-packed and visually enticing. I am not a guy, but if I was, I think I'd know this movie is tailor-made for me: filled with bravado and a cameraman who apparently can't take his lens of the eye candy and cheesy little one-liners parsed throughout here and there. This is a film tailor-made for the ""Fast and Furious"" fan.But while the action and cinematography is appealing and exciting, some areas left a little bit to be desired. I thought the plot was a little weak and convoluted. I found some of the acting to need a little improvement--the cheesy one-liners didn't help. Most of all though, the cheesy romantic components were just sad. If Diesel and the cop had one more long stare at each other, I might have hurled right there in the theater. And the way all the relationships came together at the end and pretty much everyone got their fantastical happy ending was just a bit much and over-the-top cliché. I was actually surprised at how cliché it all was. The over-the-top happy endings left me wondering where this franchise will go from here, if there is a plan for its continuation at all. There are no holes left. How will the next installment come in with all the characters rich and free and in love and whatnot? Hmmm But let not the previous paragraph deter you. This is a fun film worth seeing.",TamPalm,"Jun 10, 2011"
8,Remember to wear your seat belts for this one!,"The fifth installment in The Fast and the Furious franchise, Fast Five is an intensely gripping, thoroughly engaging & relentlessly entertaining sequel that not just brings several upgrades in all departments of filmmaking but by replacing the street racing formula with elements of a heist thriller, it ends up resurrecting this derailed franchise in style and heralds the series' heading into a new direction.Set in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the story of Fast Five follows Dominic Toretto, Brian O'Conner & Mia as they plan a massive heist to steal $100 million in cash from a ruthless drug lord & corrupt businessman and enlist the help of former allies to pull off the job which would buy them their freedom. But at the same time, they find themselves being pursued by a federal agent who's in Rio to arrest both Dom & Brian.Directed by Justin Lin, Fast Five presents the director in much different form as his kinetic work behind the camera keeps the story running on top-gear from start to finish, and the earlier momentum it gained with its explosive opening sequence is never lost. The screenplay at last places more emphasis on its story & characters, adds in a welcome amount of humour and even though the route it takes is new, the old-school formula isn't entirely discarded.The technical aspects exhibit a complete overhaul which is in sync with the transition this franchise itself undergoes through this chapter. Production design team puts up some wonderfully detailed set pieces, Cinematography makes exuberant use of its camera while the applied colour tones are more vivid than before. The events unfolds at breakneck pace, Editing is at its best during the action sequences, and the vehicular carnage it has in store is simply overwhelming.Coming to the performances, Fast Five brings the notable characters from all the previous chapters together under one roof and all of them deliver more confident performances. Vin Diesel & Paul Walker show greater maturity in their respective roles of Dom & Brian but it's the swashbuckling input from Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson that turns out to be the biggest surprise of them all. It's not difficult to assess that he was really enjoying his character and it reflects in his impressive performance.Last but not the least is Brian Tyler's score which packs in some intense, vibrant tracks that never allows the film's charged atmosphere to settle down and actually enhances the whole experience by a considerable margin. The visual effects team also brings its A- game, for the moments of action seem convincing for the most part, even if it's a tad over-the-top on few occasions. There are more thrilling moments to be found here than in all previous chapters combined and every moment featuring Johnson & Diesel together is a highlight, right away.On an overall scale, Fast Five is without a shadow of a doubt the finest chapter in The Fast and the Furious franchise and the first one in the series that manages to find a near-perfect balance between its elements of style & substance. High-octane, full- throttled & immensely satisfying, Fast Five is an action-packed, roller-coaster ride that packs in all the ingredients in just the right dosages to succeed as a genuine summer blockbuster material & a quality entertainer for not just the fans of the series, but newcomers as well. Absolutely worth your time & money.",ryanskywalker-87402,"Apr 18, 2017"

6,Somewhat failed attempt at popcorn,"Picking up the story where the previous one left off this one doesn't need much explaining story wise - the gang is still up to no good and using fast cars to do it. This time the scenery has changed to Southern America, Brazil to be exact.The theme of the films being fast cars, fast driving and action sequences galore this one does not fail to deliver. There's plenty of all of that. When it comes to adding something new to the series it does fail a bit though - it's just more of the same. Add to that the fact that most of the story is more than a little ludicrous and the end result is easily derived: if one is able to dislodge ones brain for the duration of the film then it can be enjoyed otherwise it can't.For me the turning point was the point where it became clear there were no characters to bond with. Every single one of them should be locked away for life. One can't care for characters like that - whether they live or die, escape or get caught, it doesn't matter. It makes the film flimsy and too easily forgotten.6 out of 10 corns not yet fully popped.",LazySod,"May 18, 2011"

6,Vin Diesel vs The Rock.,"Fast & Furious 5 steers the series even further away from 'car-porn' and into more accessible over-the-top summer blockbuster territory. This one even has The Rock in it!The film opens as part four closed, with Dom's team rescuing their friend while he is en route to prison by orchestrating a bus crash that, in reality, would kill everyone inside. Of course, by now, reality has nothing to do with the Fast & Furious franchise: this is a preposterous slam-bang spectacle that would have left me with a big grin on my face if it hadn't been so drawn out. At well over two hours, part 5 is at least thirty minutes longer than it needed to be. Trim the fat and it might have been the most enjoyable one so far.Anyway, with Dom free (and somehow devoid of any injuries), the action moves to Brazil where the team decide to pull another car robbery (from a speeding train, no less). Lots of mayhem ensues, with more death defying stunts, after which the crew discover a computer chip hidden inside one of the vehicles that details the activities of Rio De Janeiro's top crime lord. Armed with this information, the gang decide to pull one more heist: steal the bad guy's money - all $100million of it. Meanwhile, top US agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) is on their trail.Unfortunately, the preparation for the daring raid is where things tend to drag (although we do get to see Gal Gadot in a small bikini, so it's not all bad). The film does, however, eventually culminate in one of the craziest heist scenes in cinema, with Dom and Brian dragging a humongous metal safe around the streets of Rio, laying waste to buildings and cars in the process. Oh, and there's a car with a mini-gun that pops out of the sun roof! All of this is mindless popcorn fun if you can check your sense of logic at the door on the way in - it's just a shame that getting there is a bit of a slog at times.",BA_Harrison,"Jul 22, 2018"

7,Pretty entertaining...,"Only watching four movies a year at the theaters now, I went to see this movie out of my vestigial interest in fast cars left over after years of owning sports cars and fast cars...The plot line is pretty much just an excuse for insane chase scenes that defy the laws of physics and just all the other laws out there.The target audience will enjoy the movie, but this movie did not really bring anything new to the table as far as the cars, it brings in cast members from the previous sequels and does'nt even try to explain the connections. Besides these little quibbles, I have never seen a movie where they used so little actual real natives. They only used Rio as a backdrop and huge set, clearing the streets almost completely for all the scenes. But now that I think about it, that was the way all of the movies have been made.

1,Most average F'n'F yet,"RE: 19 April 2011 | by corey_dw (Australia) After varying degrees of success with the franchise, My faith that ""Fast 5"" could deliver on the hype was waning somewhat. However despite the fact this film hasn't been released yet and I've not actually seen it but I work for the studio I am pleased to say the series hasn't redeemed itself. Fast 5 pulls out no stops this time around. It almost delivers on action, cars, poor quality acting and a hackneyed storyline. It doesn't bother exploring the character personalities, not showing humour, fear, vulnerability and determination this time around which gives the movie no strength or depth also missing from previous Fast n Furious movies. I found myself cringing out loud a few times at the unsubtle humour, and leaning forward for the action scenes which should've been truly amazing.The Story is predictable and will not keep the surprises coming to the end. The Cast has not matured and it shows in the lack of quality of acting over previous F'n'F movies. Ironically, one of the production companies involved is called Original Productions.Pros:Average pace throughout the movieAverage storyline and plotAverage Cast of actors/ actresses Unimaginative and un-inventive elements throughoutOne or two ""Wow"" momentsCons: Would be nice to have more screen time for the carsa 130 cheesy moments ( but this adds to the humour of the film)Overall: Highly recommended if you have low expectations, nothing better to do and a free cinema ticket, or your a complete drone with no imagination who likes retarded films with spoon fed plots. Just be sure to fast forward until the end of the credits!0.5/10",StudioLAX,"Apr 25, 2011"
9,New Breed of Fast & Furious,"Ah, the film that kicked off the new breed of Fast & Furious films, Fast Five. The film that gathered all of the fan favorite characters from previous films into one gigantic ensemble. Throw in Dwayne The Rock Johnson and you have yourself what may be the best the franchise will ever be.I've had a hard time ordering which F&F film is actually the best/my favorite. 5,6, and 7 all are tremendous. They know exactly what type of film they are and what type of film they're not. Perhaps Fast Five takes the cake for being the first to truly embrace the ridiculousness of the franchise. Even with the previous film, there was a little bit of tone deaf at times with the writing. However, Fast Five takes the series to a whole new level in terms of tone, characters, and even genre.In many ways, this was a soft reboot for the series. Essentially, the characters become superhuman with qualities they just didn't have before. As far as I'm concerned, Tej was never a tech genius, Mia was never able to hack into police scanners, and Roman was never scared of anything. All of those were added in to service the story they wanted to tell in Fast Five. You know what? That's completely fine by me. A soft reboot was exactly what these films needed. If that was what we needed to do to have the characters pull off an insane heist and have a blast doing it? I'm all in.The Rock (aka franchise Viagra) adds another layer to the film as well. Gone are the days where Dom & Brian are going after one another. Now, you have 260 pounds of pure muscle going after the entire crew, and boy is it worth it. Not only is it mind-blowingly entertaining to watch Diesel and Johnson fight, Johnson actually brings a lot to the role of Hobbs. These movies have always been keen on establishing an inner code/morals for each character, and Hobbs' code works well alongside and against Dom's. Apparently, the role was originally going to be Tommy Lee Jones, but I can't imagine anyone better than The Rock to play him.Much like the previous film, Fast Five does a great job of reestablishing past relationships, developing new ones, and doubling down on the action. This series is half about family and half about how insane each stunt and action sequence can be. By this point, they nearly abandoned the street racing part for the heist angle, and it works. Heck, even the one time they do have a ""race"", it's entirely off-screen. Fast Five is the epitome of what the series has become and I'm not sure a film has matched the incredible pacing and contagious chemistry between the ensemble.+Enter, The Rock+Dom vs Hobbs+Doubles down on emotion & action+Soft reboot serves the series well-Even if some of the character changes don't make much sense9.5/10",ThomasDrufke,"Apr 12, 2017"
9,Fast five,"Now when a long running series like The Fast And The Furious get sequels it is always a challenge to go out and try impress movie goers.However the series always tops itself with the recent sequels and Fast Five proof that's anything is possible with the right minds.The plot this time take place after Fast and Furious 4 left all with Brian O'Conner played by Paul Walker, Dominic Teretto Played by Vin Diesel, Mia Toretto played by Jordana Brewster head for Brazil to escape the law after a job with Vince Played by Matt Schulze went wrong.Which leads to them being hunted by Luke Hobbs Played by Dwayne Johnson who along with Elena Played by Elsa Pataky begin to hunt them down.Also returning are Roman Played by Tyrese Gibson, Tej Played by Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Han Played by Sung Kang, Gisele played by Gal Gadot.Reyes Played by Joaquim de Almeida who serves as the Film Main Antagonist.Story wise the plot is very good because it features the return of many of the characters from the series which is very good and moves the series along. Plus the film requires you to pay attention or you'll miss something. Plus you see the characters grow in this film from the last films.What drives the film like the other films is that the stunts from start to finish that defines The Laws of Physic and why I love this series because the cast and crew are always driven to push the limits and hold nothing back, Fast Five is the example of it.There is just a lot for this film that I recommend seeing for yourself where you'll be amazed and how you can do a sequel with the right minds.With awesome stunts, great action and plot you'll be glad you watch this film.",dineshaishu,"Jul 29, 2019"
9,Re-ignites the F&F Series!,"This film had a lot of hype to live up to. With intense action sequences and the revival of Toretto and Mia supporting O'Connor in the last film, there could be no let-up of delivering an exciting yet somehow different Fast and Furious film this time around.They tried, and succeeded.They've tied in little bits of what made the other films good, all into one epic 2 hour long movie. While the plot itself is nothing original, we all know to expect this from this from a car film. But it has to be said the film is full of action, from drifting to gun fights, car, train and foot chases, confrontations, and of course, racing.The film starts right off from where we left from the last film, so we get to see how Dom is freed. Furthermore, many characters from all previous 4 movies return for the big heist, but they are given a good amount of time on screen each, which is important.And finally, we have The Rock himself making his debut into the franchise.We also learn a bit more about Dom, and the relationship Brian has with Mia and Vince (yes, Vince!). This is wrapped up with simple, witty dialogue between the gang and a few surprises in the story (not to mention a huge twist at the end mid-way through the credits. It has to be said, some stunts are pushed a little too far, but it does makes for some genuine terrific action.The only gripe I have is that it would have been nice to see more tuners but muscle car lovers won't be disappointed.A very well done to the makers of the film for bringing this one back to the roots of The Fast and The Furious while keeping the action tense and the storyline fresh.",lewisray2,"Apr 23, 2011"

5,Best in series,"Fast Five is a very good action movie with pretty much all of the characters that have appeared in the series returning for one last mission. I won't give away any piece of the story because I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen this movie and wants to read the reviews before seeing the movie. What I will say is this: the action was great, the special effects were great, and the cars were great. The actors gave solid performances. The dialogue was a bit cheesy at times but come on, the only reason we come to see these action movies is for the action. Unlike the rest of the movies in the series, Fast Five is more of a heist movie than a street racing movie which is a nice change in the series and it really shows that the series has really matured from the first movie. My only complaint is that the some of the beginning parts were a bit slow. But that one problem didn't really take away the fact that fast five is a great way to kick off the summer. I would recommend it to fans of the series and to people who are fans of action movies in general. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.",JaredGilman,"May 7, 2011"

The action sequences truly deliver and it was very impressive what they were able to do from a filmmaking perspective with the car chases, ideas for new ways of doing them, etc. The fight between Vin Diesel and the Rock plus the twist at the end with the money were clever as well!

ACTION ADVENTUREA much better improvement over the last one which was overshadowed by CGI and some unrealistic car crash sequences, this time has much of the original cast from all ""Fast & The Furious"" movies appearing on this one for doing different things against a powerful kingpin in Rio with the FBI behind it's back sought for Vin Diesel and crew for an incident regarding some murdered deputies! Their are a lot of inconsistencies and plot holes regarding the story line but keeps viewers entertained by many amusing one-liners and is classified as an action adventure with a seen to be believed chase sequence regarding a large safe, hauled by two cars. Obviously inspired by ""For A Few Dollars More"" and ""The Italian Job"" but done with some panache. But what is lacking what the first one has that this one does not is the awesome musical soundtrack which always goes well with young people and driving hand in hand whether a car is driven or not, via techno-pop! I mean, the soundtrack for the first ""Fast And The Furious"" was so catchy that it made CD sells out of the original soundtrack, which this one could've provided instead of some more boring conversations to enhance the story.",jordondave-28085,"Sep 25, 2023"

8,The Best Fast and Furious Film,"Fast Five is without a doubt the best film is the Fast franchise. I enjoyed the Fast and The Furious as a popcorn film. I did not care for either 2 Fast 2 Furious or Tokyo Drift. I thought Fast and Furious was a step up from the previous films. However, Fast Five is on a whole other level. I enjoy Furious 6 the most, but Fast Five is a better film.The characters are the best aspect about the film. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker reprise their roles here. I think they turn their best performances here. Jordana Brewster returns as Mia. She does a good job with what she is given. The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) gives his best performance in a long time in this movie. To me this is the Rock's return to action movies not Faster.
All the other cast members from the previous films return here. Tyrese Gibson comes back as Roman Pierce. I did not care for Gibson in 2 Fast 2 Furious, but I do not mind him here as much. This is probably because he is a supporting character in this film, and not a main character that has to carry the film. Ludacris (Tej) and Sung Kang (Han) return as well. I never cared about those characters but they did fine in this movie. Gisele, played by Gal Gadot comes back too. She had a small role in Fast and Furious that is not even worth noting. However, I thought her character was awesome here. The character of Vincent is back from the first movie as well. I did not like his character at all in Fast and the Furious, and I did not care for him here either. He is one of the only characters that I did not like in this film. I loved seeing the cast of all the Fast films together. The interacting they all have with each other is great and very fun.The villain, I will say is weak. That should not be a surprise at this point. The Fast films have always had weak villains. Though, I will, say, this villain is one of the stronger villains of the franchise, though that is not saying that much.The action is top-notch! The action scenes trump anything in the other Fast films before it. The action is different than the other films too. It focuses less on races (though there are some) and more on fist fight, fire fights, car chases, etc. This film is more of a heist movie than a racing movie. The effects for the film are also top of the line, and better than all of the other movies. The ending scene alone is worth seeing the movie for.Overall this is a must watch for all who are fans of this franchise. This is easily the best Fast film in almost every category whether it is characters, story, action, effects, etc. It's not Oscar material, but, as far as action films go, it's one of the best of the past decade; maybe two.",mitchell5954,"Aug 17, 2019"
5,Finally broke down and watched one of these things,"I never had any interest in the Fast and the Furious movies, which I'd never even heard of until it became the nickname for a political scandal. It sounded like something with a bunch of people racing cars and maybe committing or solving crimes or something. I don't care about speedy cars, I'm not into racing videogames, I'm definitely not the target audience.Recently I saw a trailer for a new one though, and I thought, this looks kind of fun. But since that movie got bad reviews I decided I would learn which was the best in the series and watch that.The movie was pretty much what I expected, cars and guns and muscly guys. It's stupid from the first brief action scene, which should have killed about 30 people but somehow doesn't. Then there's some unlikely plot, a bunch of driving and shooting, predictable twists, more shooting, a bunch of running.As action movies go, this seems vastly familiar to both the martial arts films of stars like Jet Li and Jackie Chan and the special effects driven superhero genre, and I don't get the appeal at all. But listen, it's not trying to entertain me, it's trying to entertain cars & muscly guys freaks, and if this sounds like something you'd like you'll probably like it.",cherold,"May 25, 2021"

10,Fast Five Review,"Ll time. This film reunites all actors from the previous films. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster , Tyrese Gibson , Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang, Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot, Tego Calderon and Don Omar, the gang are all here! They are all cast from the previous installments.The Director brings all new actors in the cast crew: Joaquim de Almeida, Dwayne Johnson and Elsa Pataky. The script, the players, the action scenes, the story. Everything about this film is awesome! This film kicks ass. Is my second favorite best film in the series franchise. This film for me even beats Furious 7. Cause Furious 7 is not that good as this film is. The far of the highest best films ever. It's actually probably my favorite movie that I've ever seen. If you like any of the other fast and furious movies SEE THIS ONE!!!!! It's a Epic movie watch it till all the way to the end.Fast Five picks up, literally, right where Fast & Furious left off. Dom (Vin Diesel) is on his way to prison when his partner, former undercover detective Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), and his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) stage a daring (albeit highly unlikely) prison-bus break. On the run from the police, the FBI and the media, the three hightail it across the border and head even further south, all the way to Rio de Janeiro. There, they decide to lay down, lay low and avoid any unwanted attention. Nah, I'm just kidding. They do what any international fugitives would do: rob a train, double cross a local crime lord named Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) and his right-hand man Zizi (Michael Irby), put themselves on the radar of a ludicrously musclebound U. S. Diplomatic Security Service agent (Dwayne Johnson), and set out to steal untold millions from Reyes. That's right, it's One Last Heist for Dom and Brian. Not that anyone should be foolish enough to think this is the last we'll see of the led-foot duo; not after Fast Five revved up $600 million at the worldwide box office. (Be sure to sit through the first chunk of end credits for a nice little surprise.) Fast Five boasts incredible action scenes that are all varied and equally exciting. The film is full of clean, well choreographed shots that are easy to watch and the cast works great as a whole unit, making the film's running time breeze by. The heist in Rio De Janeiro was amazing An energetic, high-octane. The film was brilliant and smart it was action fun Entertained. The fight scenes between Dwayne Jonson and Vin Diesel was tremendous. I was happy that they put someone (Dwayne Jonson) in the movie that was so smart like Dom (Vin Diesel) was. Luke Hobbs as A Diplomatic Security Service agent to track down Dom and his crew was awesome! He did a brilliant job In this Action packed sequel film! Just Lin deliver us a high octane Action packed story filled with full of cars and shootings in his film.Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Dwayne Johnson lead this all-star all-action movie with outrageous stunts, incredible cars and beautiful girls that pushes the limits into the red and beyond! The legendary Dom Torreto (Vin Diesel) partners with outlaw cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) on the opposite side of the law in exotic Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Hunted by ruthless Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and an army of corrupt cops working for a deadly drug kingpin. Torreto and O'Conner reunite the gang from previous Fast adventures to pull off one last job - an insane heist worth $100 million!""Five Times The Action!, Five Times the Fury!""I love this film to death and I love how they were planning to rob a Police Station. The first half was a little boring, but the second half was fast paced entertained filled with action. I love this film and everything about it. I love that it is 2.hrs long so that it can tell the whole story.When developing Fast Five, Universal Studios deliberately departed from the street racing theme prevalent in previous films in the series, to transform the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By doing so, they hoped to attract wider audiences that might otherwise be put off by a heavy emphasis on cars and car culture. Fast Five is considered the transitional film in the series, featuring only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as gun fights, brawls, and the heist of $100 million. The production mounted a comprehensive marketing campaign, marketing the film through social media, virtual games, cinema chains, automobile manufacturers, and at NASCAR races.",jonatanmm,"Oct 5, 2023"

4,If you like low quality ridiculous action go right ahead,"It's ASTONISHING any of these films beyond #3 have a rating higher than 6. It's another series that lost its way and became a shameless cash grab after the 3rd film. Every other series that does this ends up in the 4s, but somehow this is over 7!Literally 10 minutes into this and already I've seen two scenes that were funny bad. The first scene features a giant American bus crashing at speed sideways into a 1960s muscle car. No I'm joking; that would of course have been BORING, so instead it BOUNCED off the 1960s muscle car and flew over the top into a spectacular rolling motion, leaving the 60s car unscathed. Of course, everyone on the bus walked away from this monumental rolling crash in an old bus with no safety features without a scratch as well. Would never happen in real life doesn't cut it - it's laughably ridiculous. I can't watch stuff like this, it's beneath me. I'd be embarrassed to say I was a fan of this. Do people seriously watch this in the cinema with a smile, wowed by how cool and exciting it was?? Very shortly after this, we see an unfathomably dangerous jump from a train to a car (a now a trope of these films). Spectacular enough you'd think right? Well the writers of this film didn't think so, because they had the two guys drive off a huge cliff at speed immediately afterwards and about 3 seconds after their bodies hit the water at what must have been over 100mph, they came up as if they'd just jumped into a kids pool. Even if I could be bothered with the otherwise average film, these scenes make me get to the end of it thinking I just set fire to 2 hours of my life. It's actually so boring to watch such preposterous nonsense and makes me care less about the rest of it. This is similar writing/production quality and effort as fake TikTok pranks. And by the way, I've only scratched the surface. Half the scenes there's something stupid about it.And what they've done to this series is especially infuriating because the first few are some of the most iconic films to me. They are probably the best look into street racing culture of any films with good car action, good stories, good characters, good acting, good music. There was no need to turn them into generic low quality action movies. But actually what's most infuriating is that these films grew and grew in popularity after they lowered the quality and removed the identity and even got better ratings on IMDB. Any other series and they're in the 4s when they start becoming this low quality. I can't deny as a business they did a great job, but from an artistic, filmmaking and cultural perspective the series is deeeaaaad by this film.All that said, if you like low quality generic action films with this vibe and are quite happy to watch regular people in supposedly the real world do things such as fall from outer space into an active volcano and then climb out 3 seconds later without a bead of sweat these will probably be worth watching.The only things I can genuinely praise are the camerawork and sets and some of the non-action scenes are decent. And I will say they get worse with each one after 3. 4 is decent, 5 is trash, 6 is trash, 7 is a crime against humanity. I have no plans to lose any more brain cells with any newer ones.",blightersaurus,"Dec 18, 2024"

10,fast five is a great movie that you should definitely watch,"fast five is my all time favorite movie. it had great fighting and racing scenes. everything was perfect. your dumb not to like it. Vin diesel is a great actor for the movie. he's daring and always prepared. as usual, fast five had a great beginning and a great ending. it seemed like a suicide mission but they made anything possible at the end. the seen with the train was very exciting. you always wanted to know what was going to happen. The movie changed a lot to surprise you, which made it very suspenseful. they invested a lot of money into this movie with all the destroyed cars. it made it totally worth it. it is a great movie compared to the other fast and furious movies. it makes you want want to see the next sequel because it always keeps you guessing at the end. thats why i'm positive fast and furious six will be just as good or even better",dxjycz99,"Aug 30, 2011"
9,the best fast and furious movie so far,"This was the best Fast and Furious movie I have ever seen. The action-packed scenery was out of this world. It was pretty clever of Dom and his gang to slip past those cops. I think that street race that Dom and his racing buddies would go 1/4 mile for $1,000,000 while driving police cars. That scene when Dom and Brian were driving while having a safe attached to the back of their cars was so funny.It was awesome to bring all the previous cast members from the Fast and the Furious, 2 Fast 2 Furious, and Fast and Furious and ban them together to take on Hobbs, Dwayne Johnson, who was the bad boy to take Dom and the rest of the racers down.Dwayne Johnson played an excellent job being the Head Cop. His character, Hobbs is someone no one wants to fool around with.As for Vince, I thought he was gonna betray Dom by bringing him in to the cops. He seemed like he couldn't be trusted.Vin Diesel and Paul Walker make a perfect partnership for these movies that will literally DRIVE YOU WILD.For the special effects, they were incredible for my ears. I love listening to the sounds of explosions, gun shots and car crashes.The only scene I find ironic was when Dom saved Hobbs' life so he (Hobbs) joined forces with Dom's gang. Vin Diesel vs Dwayne Johnson was a bloodbath match. I hope this movie wins a few Oscars. It was stupendous.",tfbowler314,"Sep 4, 2011"
8,"Not only did it suppress the surrounding hype, it kicked, punched, shot and killed the hype.","I couldn't help but to applaud and cheer after the ending credits among with the rest of the over crowded people in the theatre. It exceeded my every expectation and being a hardcore fan of the fast and furious franchise I couldn't have asked for more from the 5th instalment. It has everything from bone crunching action, combat, shoot em up scenes and of coarse what's fast and furious without the cool dream cars.The gang are finally back together but for this time it's for one last job. The cast is recruited from a range of all the previous fast and furious movies.(1-4) Which was great to see all the characters back together kicking ass. Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) was impressive and my word he gave Vin diesel a tough competition (in the movie as well as their physique!) To be honest I had thought that fast 5 was just going to be a sappy Hollywood attempt just to bring the cash in, well I'll tell you this, the director, the cast and the rest of the crew have smashed the box office and deserve every penny of it. A perfect action/adventure flick for a night out whether your a fast and furious fan or not.After the phenomenal first instalment (the fast and the furious) A mediocre second instalment (2fast and 2furious) A inconvenient, mildly entertaining third instalment (Tokyo Drift) and a decent mildly thrilling fourth instalment (fast and furious) they bring back all the thrills, action, adventure and fun in fast and furious 5 (probably the best one out of the series so far)The 12a (PG-13) rating however did seem a bit dodgy. This film included far to much violence enough for it to easily be a 15 (this would allowed the film to bring slightly more adult themes and violence into the flick too)Don't get it twisted, this film is all Heist and not street racing but when it is as entertaining as this who cares? Thank god they avoided the ""3D era"" which in my opinion would just ruin the film due to the strange camera angles they do purposely to make it feel like it's in front of you. On that note the camera angles were actually really great and noticeable, especially when they show the spectacular RIO. (setting) Fast and furious fans will not be disappointed, especially because it has one of the most bad ass cast ever. The twist was a O.M.G moment so I strongly suggest you wait for after the credits to see this (those of you who have seen it will understand!)Overall I'm completely satisfied with this movie, it's pulled the fast and furious franchise out of the dirt and back into the fun, action-packed adventure that we all love. Take a bow the Fast and Furious crew you killed the hype and by far made the best movie this year so far. Don't miss out on such a exciting adventure and feel how ""fast and furious"" this film really is.",k-dhesi,"Apr 28, 2011"
5,Why is this so popular?,"How would i describe Fast Five? Preposterous! Ridiculous! Absurd! The film is riddled with one-liners and stunts that would kill the average human(except for Chuck Norris, but is he really human), yet it is entertaining for a summer popcorn film. i have seen all of the series, except for The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift and this one seems to be the worst of all. It is like they said lets take all the good parts of all the previous films and through it together. Unfortunately it does not work. This film was about them stealing cars, but they don't show many cars in the film and they hint at races, but skip to the next scene, so we don't actually see the races. We meet some characters, but only for as minute and then they almost disappear for the rest of the film. As i stated above, it is still entertaining, but... Just check your brain at the door.",oceansroar,"Aug 27, 2011"
8,"Packed wall-to-wall with breathtaking action sequences, this fifth entry is easily the most thrilling and the best of the 'Fast and Furious' franchise","Unless you're ""Harry Potter"", franchises rarely have much gas left in their tank by their fourth instalment, let alone their fifth. But two years ago, the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise defied its slow but sure decline by reuniting the original stars of the first movie that made it such a runaway success ten years ago, thus finding its groove once again and speeding away with the best box-office results the series has enjoyed.To prove their success then wasn't just a fluke, the stars- Vin Diesel and Paul Walker- are back at it again with a fifth-quel, and you know what- it's even faster, even more furious than anything the franchise has done. Yes, dear fans of fast cars, hot babes and most of all brawny men, ""Fast Five"" takes the hallmarks of the franchise and brings it to a whole new level. It's the best ""Fast and Furious"" movie by far, an adrenaline shot of pure guilt pleasure that promises and delivers white-knuckle thrills and edge-of-your-seat excitement.Certainly that's the expectation thanks to an exhilarating opening sequence where our favourite recalcitrant criminal Dominic Toretto and his newly-minted criminal associate Ryan O'Connor are off stealing luxury race cars on board a moving train. Besides federal agents, Dom and O'Connor also have to contend with double-crosses and oh, a looming bridge. So when you have our heroes leaping out of a speeding car while plunging into a ravine, you know you better buckle up for the ride you're going to be in for.A memory jolt for those who may have forgotten- Dom was arrested at the end of the last movie, and was sentenced without parole to 25 years in federal prison. But where's the fun in having him behind bars? So en route to a maximum security prison, Dom's transport is promptly ambushed by Ryan and his girlfriend Mia (Jordana Brewster). The trio end up in Rio, where said daring midday heist occurs and lands them on the wrong side of Rio's most feared criminal kingpin Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida).True to Dom's nature, he seizes it as an opportunity to do one big score and then go off to relax. With this nifty twist, screenwriter Chris Morgan (also the writer of the previous three films) turns what used to be a movie around the confines of the underground street racing circuit into a heist movie. Morgan also does an Ocean's Eleven as Dom assembles just about every supporting character who has appeared in one of the franchise's films for his latest crew- including Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges), Han (Sung Kang) and Gisele (Gal Gadot).The chemistry between the returning cast and characters is delightful, and Morgan reserves the best zingers in his script for their banter. New additions Tego Calderón and Don Omar also add to the fun, their mutual riffs on Tej that exploit the language barrier between the two Americans simply hilarious. Of course, the highlight of this movie is really the introduction of just about the most badass F.B.I. agent from up North, Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), sent into Rio to apprehend Dom and O'Connor.The relentlessness of Johnson's Hobbs is a good foil against the arrogance of Diesel's Dom, and their subsequent mano-a-mano no-holds-barred fistfight that results is brutally efficient. Indeed, watching Diesel and The Rock go up against each other is worth the price of admission itself, because there simply is no one bigger, badder and balder than Diesel. It's a duel made in action heaven, and director Justin Lin milks it for every punch, kick and body-smash it is worth.But Lin isn't content to rest on the laurels of his hulking action stars. A footchase across rooftops and down alleyways of the crowded, crime-ridden hillside favelas (neighborhoods) of Rio surpasses the sheer adrenaline that Jason Bourne induced in ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", and makes great use of its locale's backdrop. The finale, though, is quite something in itself and beats anything that Lin has done, or for that matter, anything that you have seen so far in the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise. We're not about to spoil the surprise for you here, but suffice to say that it will go down as one of the most breathtaking car chase sequences in cinematic history.And with that, ""Fast Five"" has more than about justified its existence by being a souped-up, pumped-up, revved-up action movie that floors its throttle from the get-go and doesn't let up for a full two hours. Yes, there are times when the dialogue borders on laughable, especially when Morgan tries to give his characters- Dom in particular- more depth and some semblance of character development.But this is not a movie that you watch for those things, and a franchise that was built on these things- rather ""Fast Five"" is about revving engines, crashing cars, brawny men and hot babes and on every one of these counts, it delivers spectacularly. We guarantee you by the time the end credits roll with a sneak peek of where the franchise is headed to next, you'll be cheering for the sixth ""Fast and Furious"" film.",moviexclusive,"May 1, 2011"

I was excited for it because I saw the previews but I did not think it was going to be THIS GOOD! I swear to god when I say this as soon as the movie started I was SMILING throughout the whole film. This movie was filled with everything that everyone wants in a movie! Explosions intensity jaw dropping action INSANE car car crashes comedy and Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson were PERFECT for this movie! The intensity between these two characters was so amazing you could feel the hate between these two! I enjoyed myself that night, overall great movie!

10,UNbelievable,"been a fan since day one, and never saw this coming. just thought it would roll along with the rest of them, and continue to be one of my favorite guilty-pleasure film series. boy was i wrong, dead wrong.fast five was incredible. from start to finish there isn't one dull moment in the movie and it's just -NOT- predictable what so ever. seeing a lot of the old cast members come together was great. they all feed off of each other so well.i loved fast five. i will not enjoy a movie this much for the rest of 2011.if i had a vagina, it would have been wet all day.",lakersfn26,"Apr 29, 2011"
10,Freaking Insanity..!!,"This movie is the best among all the 'Fast ant furious' series... It has got great action, comedy.. But its Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson and Paul Walker who steals the show.. Not much races they got in the movie as I had expected but what they got is really amazing.. The climax is the most amazing part in the movie... They do it so brilliantly and smartly... Its just amazing... Must watch for all the F&F fans.. Your are gonna love this one....!!!!I enjoyed the movie right from the start to the end.. Its really freaking insanity.. I hadn't expected so much from this movie, but it was a surprise how the movie turned out to be...I just loved Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson, they were so awesome.. People here in India didn't stop whistling when their intro scene came up.. I just enjoyed the movie and so did my friends...In short, it's a movie that shouldn't be missed... So go and watch it..

10,Fantastic,"It's rare that I come out of a movie and just want to walk back in and watch it again - and how often is that likely to happen with the fourth sequel? Probably never again! The movie has so many great moments from rooftop chases to gun battles to the amazing safe chase finale and all with very little or no CG - I'm just glad there were no tunnel chases like the previous movie. The quieter moments are great too, the extended family these characters have created make their bond very believable and like a real family they fight but ultimately have each others back. There are some extremely funny moments too, the toilet scene is funnier than anything in the latest Big Mommas House and any conversation between Tej and Roman is delightful. Surprisingly The Rock is barely in the movie but he does get a great post-credits moment with someone else from the franchise history. It's worth sticking round for that. It is a far superior action movie to most others out there and definitely better than the other car movies of late, Faster and Drive Angry - I'm looking at you.",HingeThunder,"Apr 25, 2011"

4,Not that bad.,"It's a decent movie, one of the things wrong with it is that the action scenes are so unrealistic that it's almost as if you're watching a cartoon. They are constantly scenes where someone should have been permanently hospitalized or killed. And it seems like most of the movie is totally unrealistic action scenes. I'm left virtually always asking myself ""Come on, really?"" It's also very hard to keep track of who's working for who and who are the bad guys and who are the good guys. I wish it was somewhat better and had an actual plot so that I would be anxious to see the end the next movie. Other than those things, it's not a terrible movie.",dbarr123,"May 23, 2023"

5,"Fast Five, more like Ocean's Eleven?","Fast Five, more like Ocean's Eleven?Well that was disappointing, and when a Fast and Furious film disappoints, that's pretty bad.Brian O'Conner is on the side of the thieves now as the film picks up where the last left off with him, Mia and others rescuing Dominic from prison. Now they all have the law's worst, most ruthless officer hunting them down The Rock, I mean Dwayne Johnson I mean the The Rock never mind. To finally get away from the law and live free, the team must assemble all of their allies from previous films into a group to rob from the richest Brazilian drug cartel leader.The potential for ridiculous amounts of car racing and chasing could never be higher; the franchise's deliberate step to make things before Tokyo Drift and having all noteworthy characters involved in a heist has to pay off. Well, that does mean we get Tyrese Gibson again.. But on top of that, it really doesn't work.The Fast and the Furious has now officially stepped over the line from being relatively easy going, entertaining racer films, to becoming a never-ending series of ""serious business"". The series has literally forgotten about the cars and instead feels we like the characters enough now to base the entire focus on them (to the point of having Brian and Mia about to have a child)That isn't an overstatement either, asides an opening act train heist, the film takes an hour, an hour, to get into what the series is good at. Street racing. But we don't even see the race, we just get a cheeky cut away since Brian and Dom are obviously going to win it. The assembled team spend most of their time sitting around chatting and being their individual selves from other films (Avengers Assemble, this ain't) and nothing gets done. Most of the film appears to gear towards the two big, burly bald men (Diesel and Johnson) fighting each other which I don't care for, where is the y'know, car racing?The finale is fun to watch as well as ridiculous, and the Ocean's Eleven reference earlier is not unfounded (seems like any film can get away with twists like that nowadays) but it takes so long to get there it doesn't feel particularly tense. This is the first film in the series to go over the two hour runtime, and it did not need it!It isn't precisely a bad film, but it has lost its identity as a niche piece of entertainment and instead settles into generic action movie zone. Sad really, but when you try to stretch ""street racing"" into multiple films, it'll happen.And no, it isn't as bad as the second one.",CinemaCocoa,"Apr 13, 2017"

10,By Far the Franchise's Best!,"The Fast and the Furious franchise is not the best franchise out there but the first four films were just fun, over-the-top movies that doesn't need a plot. I didn't know that there could be any masterpieces in this series, then Fast Five came along. What we got here is more fun, absurd action, impossible stunts, returning characters from past films, and yes, emotion.Justin Lin's film takes place right after Fast & Furious ended, with Brian and Mia rescuing Dom Toretto from life imprisonment. After that, they travel to Rio de Janeiro where they plan to lay low. But they soon figure to do one last deal before they retire. They bring in old friends to help them do the cash grab of a lifetime. But, Luke Hobbs, a beefed-up cop on a mission is the one who plans on bringing the gang down.Vin Diesel and Paul Walker have great chemistry in this film. Woking together for three films will do this to actors. I loved that many of the old faces such as Tyrese Gibson, Sung Kang, Ludicrous, and Matt Schulze have returned. Jordana Brewster is still looking good after all these years.Overall, this is one heck of a ride. What makes this film work is that instead of a racing cars film, we have a heist film. This follows in the footsteps of the Ocean's trilogy and it works. I loved all these stunts. They get better as each movie progresses. I don't know how they did this, but I really liked that preposterous scene where Vin and Paul jumped out of a car while it drives off a cliff. That was just incredible. This is definitely the best in the series and I'm excited for the sixth installment. I rate this film 10/10.",g-bodyl,"Feb 4, 2013"
8,"Dwayne Johnson Only Improves On This Series,","Fast Five is a fantastic movie with a really well developed storyline that continues right were the fourth Fast & Furious left off.The cast are all brilliant as usual,but a lot of credit for making this the best Fast & Furious yet has to go to the addition of Dwayne Johnson,his performance as Luke Hobbs was outstanding,he was intimidating and scary and he suited the role perfectly.This one is certainly for action packed than the previous four and a much more exciting story to it as well.Fans of the previous Fast & Furious and fans of action movies in general will love Fast & Furious Five.Dominic (Vin Diesel) escapes from prison with the help of Brian (Paul Walker) and Mia (Jordana Brewster) and they all become wanted criminals.Dominic plans a heist with a bunch of lose friends to win back their freedom.",lesleyharris30,"Jun 20, 2013"
8,Fast five,"This is the film that single-handedly got me to give the rest of the series a shot, for better or worse. It's a nice change of pace from the previous films where it abandons the street race angle (how far could you have taken that anyway?) and goes into the direction of a heist action flick with cars. Dwayne Johnson is a great addition and really adds to the series embracing the goofiness of its premise. So yeah, still the best this franchise had, and that's kind of rare for a franchise on its fifth film. The action for the most part is really handled well and a lot of fun to watch. The cast as an ensemble are very charismatic which no doubt makes it more fun for audiences to see a cast that has so much diversity and it's not done with generic stereotypes but just a bunch of people with a common interest. Overall a very entertaining action flick.",dilipbts,"Jun 10, 2020"

The mere originality that Justin Lin delivers is without a doubt one of the most incredible ones I have ever experienced.

8,Fast Five review by Featured Flicks,"***Don't miss the bonus scene after the credits***Fast Five is a heart pounding thrill ride that easily beats the previous four movies in the quarter mile! I really enjoyed this movie and was surprised to find that many critics agree. After seeing the movie I was really happy with the storyline, as it was more complex and thought out then the previous movies.There were many other things to love about this movie besides the story. The scenery in Brazil was magnificent. Aerial shots of Rio are always beautiful, what an awesome city!There were many stars from previous films, which made the on screen reunion more dynamic and enjoyable if you've seen the other films. Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), and Han (Sung Kang) all make a reappearance and lend their expertise to grab a share of a cool $100 million.To top it off Fast Five has more action, explosions, gunfire, fist fights and car wrecks than you can imagine. This is a two-hour adrenaline ride that will exceed all of your expectations of what and action movie can be. I enjoyed Fast Five's action originality, geographic selection of Rio, and complete story.

It is blended with thrill, action, fight, and sentiment scenes. Right from the beginning to the end, you could enjoy by watching the action scenes of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. Along with them Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) joined and performed some action sequences to give more enjoyment to the F&F fans. As well as the old street race folks join the hands with F&F 5 team to show some formal car stunt sequences. At last, in this edition Mrs. Paul Walker gets pregnant and her brother Vin Diesel got a second hand hot chick as a future loving lady. Eventually, the way this movie ends I felt the completeness work done by the Director, rare to see this fulfillment in the English movies.",gopi-wings,"May 7, 2011"

8,The BEST Fast/Furious sequel,"While this movie doesn't have much straight up street racing its got plenty of everything else. This is the one sequel where they got the action right on all aspects. Not much CGI at all unless it was so good you couldn't tell. Crazy shootouts and an awesome fight scene. The story is probably the best out of all the sequels, while not quite that great. Its a rip off from The Italian Job, but i never liked that movie.The character development is there for our main cast from the first film. While a couple action parts are cheesy its hard not to like this movie. Much better then the last film and Dwayne Johnson made the movie better. If your a fan of the franchise go see this because they just reinvented the whole franchise.",lilicedude227,"May 8, 2011"
2,Bad Movie,I don't know how this movie was liked by so many people!! It is probably as bad or slightly better than Fast & Furious 4. The last FF movie that I liked was Tokyo drift. Rest of them (following it) are just boring and uncreative.The movie has a plot which is borrowed from Ocean's eleven without a clear role for each of the players. The car chase scenes are unbelievable and stupid. There were hardly any decent car chase scenes. Last 2 minutes of the movie was a big product placement gig!The Only thing that was warm about the movie was the presence of inter- racial couples. Except that every thing else was as cold and unexciting as a arctic winter!,xyzthedude,"May 6, 2011"

It is extremely entertaining by being able to deliver fast action car chases, explosions, car wrecks, AWESOME fights, etc. No one can say this movie is not over the top in that aspect. The whole family theme was very well played by each character and everyone did their part. But out of the whole FnF series this IS the best.The brilliant idea to bring the entire cast back works great in this movie and it does come off as a reunion movie. I have seen them all and all the FnF wanna be movies, this one is it. Let this movie be the movie that starts your summer. Thanks to Justin Lin and everyone who worked on this movie you really delivered. I think this will be a $100 million dollar opening for you.",ashanti1922,"Apr 30, 2011"

8,"My favorite in the franchise so far, although it almost has nothing to do with street racing","This really is my favorite in the franchise so far although it really isn't like any of the other films in this franchise in the past. In fact this one has to do with heist involving cars and has almost nothing to do with street racing at all. But that doesn't matter cause this is a entertaining movie with thrills and it's a real adrenaline rush. This really is a film for men with tough guys, suped up cars, insane action sequences, explosions, guns blazing and hot girls and etc. This movie is a definition of a entertaining popcorn flick. The plot is stupid but it's still sure fun to watch when the set pieces and action sequences are done in a very entertaining manner although very over the top. Physics don't apply in this movie at all and the crazy stuff happening on screen doesn't make any sense sometimes but that doesn't matter cause overall this is a stupid entertaining flick. Yeah it has a lot of elements guys like to see, but a lot of girls enjoyed this movie as well. The adrenaline runs out sometimes since the action and the stuff going on gets a bit tiresome after a while though. Most of the team members in the heist played the character off alright. And surprisingly The Rock(Dwayne Johnson) was pretty good in this playing the badass macho cop. This movie also has few scenes that are memorable that actually stands out, one of them is the scene where Vin Diesel and The Rock duke it out in a melee hand to hand fighting.8/10",KineticSeoul,"May 2, 2011"

9,High Speed Thrills For The Entire Family,"WOW!!!!This is my first review but I just couldn't resist throwing a big shout out to this movie. I am a 53 year old woman and I took my 30 and 14 year old daughters and we were all on the edge of our seats for 2:10. We had already fallen guiltily in love with parts 1 and 2 on instant watch Netflix, skipped 3, and have 4 on order. This sequel had just the right amount of action mixed with better plot and definitely more character development and emotional bonding than the other entries in the franchise. All characters are brought together and the addition of the Rock just amps up the sweat and muscles. The bookend action scenes are jaw dropping and though I started the series in love with Paul Walker, Vin Diesel is now my first love. The dialog is still cheesy and there is still plenty of macho posing and women in scanty garb but it's what we expect from this series. The best part is that this movie can be watched by the entire family and that is rare these days with all the profanity, blood, and sex. I only remember maybe 5 curse words in the entire movie, and although there was a lot of gunfire the blood was kept to a minimum. We went to a 5:30 pm showing in a large theatre and it was almost sold out with a long line waiting for the next showing when we left.

I give great respect to all the actors, and i must say I'm not gay or something but Diesel has the charisma that when i see his movies i don't have problems to see them again. Not like some Jason Bourne stuff it's good but you don't see it more than once.

10,Amazing,"Simply amazinggreat action - great that the characters are united - great story - great endingaction packed and one of the best films of this decade. You really get into the the characters too (if watched all other films over and over again like me)The heist element is also very good and love the flexibility and diversity of the changing plots, unpredictable enjoyment another key feature that can not be ignored is the setting, it's great. Wonderfully scenery and adds to the plot extremely wellOverall a must see",b-s-uniteds-biggest-fan,"May 3, 2011"
10,Let us pay homage to all the automobiles that were sacrificed in the making of this movie.,"One thing about this movie becomes immediately apparent: its fixation on the automobile. This is a movie that goes through automobiles like a glutton consumes food. The wreckage and carnage is nonstop. This movie is a junkyard dealer's dream. This movie may set a record for the most automobiles demolished in one movie. In this movie, automobiles are crashed, smashed, dismantled, reassembled, assessed, analyzed,and discussed. In this movie, automobiles are more than just props, they are characters too who are sacrificed to achieve a greater good, which is to tell a story. When an automobile blows up one can almost imagine that poor hunk of metal grimacing in its final death throes, as the humans fight on. Almost all the action centers around automobiles, flashy automobiles, as well as their cousins, the armored cars, trucks, and vans. In this movie, if an object has an engine and wheels it is vulnerable to destruction by fire, blunt force or explosion, or a combination of all three. In this movie automobiles are put through their paces. This movie shows that when an automobile traveling at an extremely high speed makes contact with some other heavy object, the results can be spectacular, and in this movie it is proved time and time again. All this being the case, this has to be one of the best action movies made in a long time. The movie brings together all the elements need to produce a credible, entertaining product. The story is innovative and original; the acting is strong; and the cinematography, including special effects, is incredible. The good guys are really good and the bad guys are really bad. Jordana Brewster is beautiful as are all the female cast, but Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson have a screen presence which carries this movie. They are an entertainment team that is unmatchable. Bringing these two superb and charismatic performers together in one movie works brilliantly. The story moves forward relentlessly, each scene crammed with action. Also, this movie contains spectacular panoramic vistas of Rio de Janeiro and the music is snappy, as is the dialog. There is quarreling, fighting, friendship, teamwork, love, loyalty, and betrayal. Dwyane Johnson is the new Arnold Schwarzenegger, except that Mr. Johnson is better. His screen presence is incredible. In addition, he can act! Congratulations to everyone involved in making this movie. It is a masterpiece. This movie is a much-watch for any action movie aficionados and for movie buffs in general consistent with the movies PG-13 rating.",PWNYCNY,"May 4, 2011"

10,Everything that the first four should have been.,I went to see Fast Five the day it came out and the theater was so packed that they had to stop letting people into the movie. My first thought was. If this movie is bad then there will be a lot of angry people. NONE whatsoever. The people in the theater were so pleased with Fast Five that most stood up an gave an applause. There is a reason why this movie broke the record for movies opening in the month of April. Because it's THAT good! BOOM! Everything about this movie is better than the previous installments.1. Storyline 2. Action 3. Tension 4. Acting 5. HumorMy Fast Five for list of improvements. Fast Five was easily the best installment thus far in the series. My personal favorite movie of the year so far. Also Dwayne Johnson's performance was flawless. I guarantee this movie to everyone whether they like the Fast & Furious series or not.,invisiblecdog,"May 9, 2011"
1,Can I have my 2 hours back?,"Definitely in the bottom 3 movies I have seen. I'm a Vin Diesel fan all the way back to Multi-Facial. I liked Pitch Black and Chronicles of Riddick along with just about everything else he's done. Even the first Fast & Furious was a good action movie. Hell, I even liked XxX! This one was pretty bad.I try to have suspension of disbelief when I watch anything but I just couldn't enjoy this movie due to all of the strange character development and plot holes. I know a lot of people really like this movie (including my brother who said it was one of the best movies he's seen -- gonna have a talk with him) but it just wasn't my cup of tea.If you like the F&F movies then you should see this one. If not, then move along and find something better to watch. When I checked IMDb for this movie prior to getting it the rating was 7.4. This is one of the rare times that IMDb's ratings have let me down.Overall the acting was horrible, the plot was bad, the action sequences were hard to follow, and the characters really weren't likable. I saw on IMDb that they're making F&F6... Why? Were there that many unanswered questions from the first 5? Make Riddick 3 or Iron Giant 2 instead!!",seanbreeden,"Nov 23, 2011"
9,Fast Five is supercharged and running on NOS,"After the horrendously disappointing sequel that was 2fast 2furious, my hopes of reliving the excitement and energy of the original were dashed, quicker than Dom could push the NOS button on his pimped out charger.Tokyo Drift was refreshing, and Fast and Furious was a step in the right direction. I'm so glad then, that Fast Five has resurrected my love for outrageously overpowered cars driven by super-models speeding to hyper techno low bass music. This movie rocks.Of all the movies in the series, it is by far the most action-packed. Explosions, car chases, free-running, you name it. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, and occasionally it will throw you off it.The acting has improved, which is to be expected, since most of the actors have gained experience since the first installment. Adding The Rock as an antagonist to Vin's character was a smart move. It kept the film fresh, and built up tension between the characters.The only problem I have with this film is it's lack of focus on the cars themselves. Don't get me wrong there are enough cars in the film to fill Jay Leno's garage, but I wish they would incorporate a deeper level of interest in the cars, and not just the characters. But besides that minor issue, you will love this film, it's full of new ideas, and it even has a twist to boot, something I was not expecting.Fast Five goes back to the original formula, tweaks it a bit, and blasts it back in your face.Highly recommended9/10.",iamthematrix-1,"Apr 30, 2011"

8,Great Action and Value for Money F&F Film,"Any reviewer who rates this low (thereby bringing down the IMDb rating for this film) completely misses the point of the F&F franchise and the writers' intention to bring a fun, action-packed car chase film to it's fans - not, to challenge the minds of intellectuals or get all the physics right. Let's face it, what movie DOES? It's entertainment! You're paying to be wowed and impressed - not to learn how a car crumples on slamming into the ground awkwardly at high speeds. Criticise this film for its lack of realism and you'll join the pack of nay-sayers and party-poopers in the corner! Straight up, this film is one of the best - if not THE best - of the Fast and Furious series so far. It's loaded with crazy fast paced action, which it delivers right off the bat with an explosive rescue of Dom from his prison bus. Totally crazy, but totally amazing to watch - as are all of the action sequences including dragging an over-sized object behind the cars and having it slam into everything in sight. Hilarious, maddening and absolutely awesome to watch! Hey, it's entertainment.One thing that this movie does do for fans is get all the favourite cast members back together for a great heist film. The car racing is not as prominent in this movie, as in previous versions, but it still includes some exciting races with the lead characters. Stunt driving is there in droves, and the cars - whilst not a huge range - are impressive enough to wet one's appetite.The story is solid, and the characters are well defined and the introduction of The Rock into the mix, facing him against Vin Diesel, is a waving banner for ""great fight sequence""! It's intense and reminiscent of the crazy WWE action! There's a bit of romance, a sprinkling of a thriller and suspense, a sampling of horror (softened for a well rounded audience), plenty of over the top action and the standard comedy moments (keenly enjoyed in this series). If you want a new take on the Fast and Furious series, with plenty of good times and value for money - whether you see it in a cinema, or rent it on DVD/BD - then Fast Five is certainly worth every cent!",Zelnak,"Sep 12, 2011"
5,"Pretty, but soulless with it","I have to say I was disappointed by FAST FIVE. I've been deriving minor enjoyment from these movies since they began, and I'd heard good things about this movie; how it had less CGI, how it was bigger, better and more intense as an action flick. Well, the good news is that it feels fresher in that it veers off in a slightly different direction in that it's not ALL about the car chases this time around, but it still feels lacklustre and less than the sum of its parts.The problem with this film is that the franchise is just getting too big and too sluggish now. There are too many guys in the team, too many of whom are token ethnic or misplaced comic relief. It means that few of the principle cast get much screen time. Vin Diesel is hulking and kind, but never gets a chance to emote. The Rock, as the new participant, bags the best role, but really the film is about those two guys and that's it. Paul Walker seems bored and the likes of Sung Kang barely register.The plot feels like something from the recent Italian Job and GONE IN 60 SECONDS remakes with the team assembling in Brazil to rip-off a drugs lord. Despite the huge budget and plethora of car-smashing stunts, it's never as exciting as I'd hoped it would be; the viewer feels detached from the action, set back and never as fully involved as he is in a really good action movie (like a Bourne film; I'm thinking in particular of the climactic car chase in THE BOURNE SUPREMACY). I'll keep watching these, but I hope number six gets a few more things right.",Leofwine_draca,"Feb 1, 2014"

8,okay kinds,"Waatching the previous F&F movies !i Thought this movie dint live up to expectation. They tried to get all the old stars but many of them look quite old. And seriously dint have the tedious race sequences as it was more abut robbery....!!! Whatever it sure is good in terms of the attitude and the final sequence of chase is simply awesome. Especially, loved it when the truck right in between the road to surprise its true reason for being on roads. Sure is worth a watch. Among all the previous F&F movies, i guess the ""Tokyo Drift"" is the best of movies I have ever watched. Find it really hard for any of the movies to come close to that. I guess the next part of the movie they should pick up some of the latest model and told something about the latest car. In fact, they should bring in those Aston Martins, Bugatis, Formula-1 cars, allthose re completely missing. If you watch Transporter-series, they focused so much on the car, even F&F needs something more & abit extra X-factore :)",nameesh,"May 21, 2011"

4,"Gratuitous and routine, but highly enjoyable in places","I'll start by saying i was never a big fan of the fast and the furious movies, but this is definitely the one i liked the most.The story starts off with Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and former cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) living as fugitives following the events of the last movie. They retreat to Rio de Janeiro upon hearing about a ""job"". Soon they find themselves fixated on stealing money from a corrupt Brazillian businessman, and making a fresh start. The FBI has also hired Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) a highly revered DSS agent to track down Toretto and 0'Conner and arrest them both.The film basically becomes a run-of-the-mill heist film that pulls many tricks that countless other heist have done before or better.The pacing of the film is very uneven, the action scenes are fast-paced with quick edits. But when someone isn't driving/running/shooting at something the movie doesn't just slow down - it grinds to a complete halt. This is likely because the dialogue is flat and the way the actors deliver is lacks any real emotion, going through every cliché in the heist film handbook.Paul walker is his usual bland self, I consider him the king of underacting. Vin Diesel is okay, but his delivery is slurred and not always legible and he looks physically tired throughout most of the film. Every other member of the cast is forgettable, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Sung Kang etc. All the women are underdeveloped sex-objects that all look the same. I can imagine the casting call: 'Call every ""other guy"" from the last 4 movies and see who says ""yes""'. It surprises me to say that Dwayne Johnson was the best actor in this, he seems to actually be trying with his performance and he has a few genuinely badass scenes.The driving scenes in the movie (as far as I could tell) appeared to mostly use practical effects rather than throw a load of CG cars around - I hugely admire this decision and it looks damn good. The climax of this movie is genuinely awesome, the whole part where they're dragging a safe through Rio (as implausible as it may be) is brilliantly shot and edited.Bottom line is this - If you like the last 4 films, you will enjoy this one. If you hated the last films there is absolutely no reason for you to see this because if you do you will hate it even more than those films.I would recommend people to get this movie on DVD as a rental, that way you can skip all the arduous dialogue scenes and go straight to the action.",limoncella-641-42235,"Apr 24, 2011"

8,Like a two hour long roller coaster ride.,"After seeing 2 Fast 2 Furious back in '03, I had lost interest in this series. 2 Fast was pretty entertaining, but the story lines were just too similar for my liking. Because of this, I opted not to see Tokyo Drift or 2009's Fast and Furious. But after hearing rave reviews about Fast Five, I decided to give it a shot, and I'm very glad I did.Dominic Toretto, his sister Mia, and Brian O'Conner are in Rio de Janiero trying to start a new life and gain their freedom. But the gang soon finds themselves between a rock and a hard place, as a powerful businessman/drug lord wants them dead and a relentless Fed by the name of Luke Hobbs (played by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) wants them in prison. Needless to say, the story is action-packed, which brings me to the action sequences: they are plentiful and they are intense! A kick-ass fight scene between Toretto and Hobbs was especially memorable for me. Granted, a lot of the stunts are very far-fetched, but what would you expect, this is a Fast and Furious movie, and the seemingly non-stop action makes the 2 hours and 10 minutes a very fun ride. Jaw-dropping action, a fast-paced story, a bold performance by Johnson, and lots of beautiful women; add it all together and you've got a very worthy addition to the Fast and Furious series.",Astyanax85,"May 3, 2011"

This movie was one of those, ""stop making these"" movies. The actions scenes in these movies were less believable than Die hard or Charlie's Angels full throttle. The writing and directing tried to make a super movie by bringing everyone back from the first and second to play in this movie.

There's less racing and more action in this one and it could well be the best of the series - intelligent, fun, exciting, and even some heart, this really does have it all - and it a great guys' popcorn movie.The action takes place in Rio - and after corrupt cops and the FBI all start chasing our heroes they decide to go for one last big score both for the money and revenge.Honestly, this is entertaining action, and an absolute knock-out of a movie - don't let the fact that this is the 5th installment fool you - this is full-blown with a real budget and action stars - all in all a truly entertaining movie.",intelearts,"Aug 19, 2011"

The plot takes it time to build to it's finale and the pace is great. and you will have a couple of moments where your jaws will drop unintentionally from the action scenes in the movie.All in all a great movie that is a must see, you will enjoy it and you friends will enjoy it too, i guarantee that.",L_Knight_91,"May 8, 2011"

Cool and solid cars as in previous movies. Chicks wearing bikinis and riding hot bikes. Has some irrelevant superman fighting sequences but what about it every movie needs it. Good casting everyone fits well in their characters. Full of awesome stunts from the start to the end. One can never fall asleep while watching such a movie.

3,Just awful,"I don't even know if we can call it cinema. This is full of cliché (sex, money, women, big cars, muscles, American imperialism etc..) and action scenes totally surrealistic. And once again the Americans think they can go in a foreign country and rule as if they were back home. I mean by that when the American police crew, led by the Rock, arrive in Brazil they behave like they have jurisdiction and an authority there... They come in and talk like xxxx to the Brazilian police and start giving orders all around (in a foreign country, like if it's even remotely possible). Only Americans can like this kind of thing and not find it suspicious. I'm not even gonna start with the actions scenes or the scenario which are like bad science fiction or I could write 10 pages.

For me, the F&F series would end at that number one.But yesterday, intrigued by the 7.3 IMDb rating of F&F 5, I decided to give that movie a chance. And... action, action and action. Nicely done. Beautiful, amazing and, even, the unexpected: the movie has a lot of originality!The first action scene is absolutely fantastic, and literally breathtaking. And the one near the end... I can just say amazing... while I'd like so much to talk about it - but this comment would be flagged as spoiler. Not only that scene belongs to the ""never seen before"" category, but also it was filmed from the right angles, and it looks real (maybe it is!).The script is not from Agatha Christie, of course, and one may anticipate and guess some of the developments during the movie, find a few plot holes, but, clearly, this is not what you want from the movie. It is more than watchable thanks to the amazing action scenes, and the brilliant making that seized the most from those scenes.Finally, Brazil, the Brazilians and the Favelas add a lot to the atmosphere, colors and photography. This is also why the movie looks ""different"".If you need to get some more energy, to get 120% woken up, ready to run / work / whatever, watch that movie ; this is far more efficient than an energy drink!",Affirmative_Dave,"Feb 19, 2012"
10,An AWESOME movie!!,"I am a Fast and Furious fan, and of the essence that made the first film in which there's more than just mindless and spectacular car racing and tuning but there was a sense of family and belonging, then choosing to be faithful to ones new friends even if that means becoming hunted like them. The second and third film were as awesome but they lost that feeling, but in Fast and Furious 4 it went back to the roots that made this franchise so enjoyable and back to its original characters. But coming back to Fast Five, it is just as wonderful and breathtaking. I loved every single second of it! The fight between Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson was EPIC as was the car and safe chase! If it was 3-D I bet the safe would have been coming out at us! Justin Lin understands the franchise and is more than worthy to carry it on. There was of course an echo of the first film with Dwayne Johnson's character letting Toretto and O'Connor go, still saying he'll see them again. That friendship was unexpected but awesome!In short, A MUST SEE MOVIE FOR ANY FAST AND FURIOUS FAN OR NON FAN EVEN. I hope they will make F&F 6 as planned!",mike198326,"May 2, 2011"

8,"Not As Fast, But Five Time The Fury.","Short of the last installment of this franchise I have been pretty satisfied. I enjoyed the sequel. I think the combination of J Singleton and Tyrese made for a humorous follow up, but I think it was a little too chocolate for a vanilla audience. I was reluctant to see Tokyo Drift and mostly because of the Bow Wow factor, but it was a really good film, much in the spirit of The Karate Kid going to Japan. No, not the weak one with Jaden Smith the original and only Karate Kid in my book Machio! This time around, Fast 5 grabs you by the tailpipe and delivers a supercharged, high octane blast that Detroit never saw coming. We finally find out why Vinnie's last name is Deisel. The movie was riddled with a lot of bad one liners, but the action is so rough rugged and raw, you can overlook the fact that these guys are too old to be living life one quarter mile at a time. The Rock is a menace and from an action sense steals the show. Paul Walker further proves that he was never qualified or even capable to have been a federal agent, but is perfect of the do anything for a buddy, pop the e-brake kinda cat.It might sounds like I'm not a fan, but I think with a few tweaks this could have been great instead of really good. If you are expecting over tuned cars with all kinda of tricked out features, this series has matured and it's more about the story than it is the accessories. It's had to talk much about the film without revealing twists and spoilers so stay through the credits for another 2 piece combo that will leave you saying ""Keyser Soze""!

10,The Heist Formula,"Moving beyond the street racing roots, Fast Five introduces a well-executed heist plot. The team dynamic and meticulous planning create a fresh narrative approach, opening the door to more ambitious storytelling. Dwayne Johnson's Debut: Johnson's introduction as Luke Hobbs injects an electric energy into the franchise. His no-nonsense, relentless federal agent is the perfect foil for Vin Diesel's Dominic Toretto, leading to some of the film's most intense and memorable moments. Spectacular Action Sequences: The film sets a new standard for action with jaw-dropping set pieces, including the Rio de Janeiro rooftop chase and the iconic vault-dragging finale. These sequences are bold, inventive, and unforgettable.",mapepapro,"Dec 19, 2024"
10,Great addition to the sequel,"This is the best of the sequel so far , with the addition of Dwayne Johnson ""the rock ""it can only make fast 5 a lot more entertaining. The races are also lit with more of the street races. The fast five is the most entertaining of the sequel this far for me no doubt and I'm sure if loved the previous ones You'll agree with me that it's just the perfect.Movie to watch if you love action thrilled movies.If you love watching vin diesel and Paul walker do their thing in the magnificent way they always do with them fast cars , then this will keep you on the edge of your seat 😉.If you haven't watched it yet what you waiting for.",luthertakamartin,"Dec 17, 2024"
8,A Very Good Addition To The Franchise,"The fifth installment of this fun franchise.This time the action moves to Brazil, where we follow Dominic Toretto and the other characters as they try to rob a powerful criminal. Some new characters enter the story, such as Hobbs, played by Dwayne Johnson. His character is a fun addition to the franchise.The scenography is good, the soundtrack could be a little better, but it's not bad. The characters are over the top, but that's what's fun about this type of movie.A combination of action, humor and a fun story, this movie doesn't try to be something it's not, this is a movie that wants to entertain us.It is excellently directed, the car chase scenes are interesting, fun and look great. The film is filled with action scenes, car chases and gunfights.This movie is made to entertain the viewer and it certainly succeeds in that.",dk777,"Mar 24, 2023"
3,Complete disappointment,"I don't understand how people review this movie as being good. It was terrible. The plot had many loopholes so if you want to appreciate a good story, you can't. Even if you look beyond the loopholes in the story, some of the scenes are just impossible. What I loved about the first movie was the fact that for the most part it was realistic. This movie had too many unrealistic scenes. I'd rather not gives examples cause I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone.Someone described this movie as being a heist film rather than street racing. It was well said, because if you turn a street racing movie into a heist movie, its obviously going to fail. And there is just no way to make a good plot out of it. Just so some people have an idea of how disappointing this movie was... there is no race scenes. At least none that important or anything. It was not a fast and the furious movie at all. It was just a way for them to make so much money.",saintssilhouette,"May 9, 2011"
10,Great Movie,"This was a long awaited film and it was awesome.Lived up to the F&F name.Bringing back 4 of the originals was awesome.High impact chases, almost improbable fight scenes, corrupt government officials, you name it this movie had it.Can't wait for F&F6.If you have not seen this movie you must stay through the credits.There was must applause at the end.The Rock was a great addition.Can't wait for the Blu Ray release of these.",kinghq1,"May 1, 2011"
9,Vin and The Rock in Summer Fun Movie,"Showcasing Director Justin Lin's signature accelerated precision, Vin Diesel's Dom races beside the speeding train as Paul Walker's Brian leaps into Dom's sports car. Their car immediately careens over a steep chasm into the river below. Diesel and Walker leap in midair out of the car, and plunge into the water. ""Fast Five"" is just great fun. Writer Chris Morgan's story is better than the last ""Fast and Furious"", which isn't saying much. Then again we don't see ""Fast Five"" for the narrative nuances. Non-stop action reigns supreme. Lin has a crisp vibrant visual style, and acumen for insane action. Lin has two cars racing through the streets of Rio dragging a bank vault unleashing mass destruction. Granted this is over the top, and completely original. ""Fast Five"" has stunning Rio de Janeiro locals, gorgeous women, fast cars, and Vin Diesel squaring off against ""The Rock"" Dwayne Johnson. Lin has methodically checked off all the boxes.The theme of family distinguishes ""Fast Five"" from completely superfluous fare. In a quiet moment Dom reminisces about his father. He remembers him working all day, and staying up late at night helping his sister Mia with her homework. He recalls the generous neighborhood barbecues he had. Conversely, Brian has regrets about his father, ""He just wasn't around."" Perhaps he has chance to alter his fate. Amidst the flash, ""Fast Five"" earnestly adheres to family and loyalty.The band is back together in ""Fast Five"", for one last heist. If I am not mistaken one of the band, Han played by Sung Kang died in a previous Lin directed sequel. Stranger things have happened. The accelerated opening sequence recaps the rescue of Dom Toretto, where the last movie ended. Federal agent Brian O'Connor and Dom's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) daringly execute the operation to free Dom from serving an undeserved life sentence. In context what else could that be? Dom risked his life to help Brian solve a heinous crime and bring killer to justice. Lin throttles the adrenaline and velocity in this deadly game of chicken with a prison bus. This is only an omen of things to come.As ""Fast Five"" resumes, Mia (Brewster) and Brian (Walker) have been on the run in Rio. They are seeking to rendezvous with Dom (Diesel). Dom has one last heist in mind: robbing the bank vault in the Rio Police Station with $100 million of crime lord Reyes (slick and villainous Joaquim de Alemeida). Apparently, Reyes' rule and influence knows no bounds in Rio. So Dom assembles his old team. Dwayne Johnson, massive hard muscle, shaved head and goatee, plays singular and intense Federal Agent Hobbs, who is out to bring Dom to justice. He instructs Rio official to ""Stay the f*** out of my way."" Hobbs and his team always get their man. As Hobbs, Johnson is imposing and handles guns and his fists with explosive results. Of course we are waiting for Vin to take on The Rock in the final epic battle. Chris Morgan ingeniously stacks the story. Dom is the thief with a code. Hobbs is the cop with honor. Reyes is the true villain. Much like gravity, we can kind of figure how things will fall.Predictability is some of the charm of ""Fast Five"". Vin Diesel plays to his minimalist strength as Dom. Emotive is not his deal, but that is not required here. He commands the screen, and often surprises in his underplay. Paul Walker has become a pretty good actor. Not much is demanded of him here. He deftly uses his charm and smarts. The Rock is great as Hobbs. He imposes as a formidable rival. Here Johnson's straight arrow persona leverages the story's ultimate conflict. ""Fast Five"" is not going to win any awards. It is just great fun. I look forward to the next sequel.",jon.h.ochiai,"May 14, 2011"

5,Fast Five (2011),"Directed by Justin Lin. Starring Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Jordana Brewster, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Sung Kang, Tyrese Gibson, Gal Gadot, Joaquim de Almeida, Elsa Pataky, Matt Shultze, Tego Calderón, Don Omar, Michael Irby. (PG-13)With Walker firmly on the wrong side of the law now, Diesel and his ""family"" hightail it for Rio where they plot to lighten a crimelord's wallet by about $100 million. Meanwhile, federal agent and bounty hunter Johnson assembles a team to extract our dopey heroes and bring them to justice. As dumb and loud as one would expect from the fifth entry of this astonishingly venerable series, it's more in the spirit of heist movies like ""The Italian Job"" and ""Ocean's Eleven"" than the muscle car drive-in fodder that inspired the first few pictures. Whenever it attempts even a scintilla of dramatic/emotional underpinning, take a bathroom break, 'cause the only reason to tune in is for a series of thunderingly absurd action set pieces, which are mostly pretty entertaining (the big throwdown between Diesel and Johnson, though, has zero suspense since they both give and take blows like they were Terminators). Within about five minutes of his first appearance, one would prefer getting a foot crushed under a car's tire than hear another one of Gibson's obnoxious wisecracks; in fact, just muting it altogether would be for the best, provided the viewer's mouth is hydrated enough to constantly make their own ""vroom vroom!"" noises.54/100",fntstcplnt,"Oct 3, 2019"

8,Wow! I think I have a new Second favorite in the Fast and The Furious franchise!,"I loved it! This action packed, stunt filled, car heavy entry in the Fast and The Furious franchise nave have moved into the slot of my second favorite so far...causing me to reorder the series thus far:1. The Fast and The Furious (held by the first film which started the franchise and will forever remain near and dear to my heart...with a great ""family"" centered plot heavy on respect.2. Fast Five (new to this position...and I am going to call it the gang's all together)
3. Fast and Furious (Film#4 The revenge of Letty)
4. The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift (#3the high school entry set in the future)
5. 2 Fast and 2 Furious (#2...set in Miami without Dom and the gang)Film number five takes us to gorgeous Brazil, specifically Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana and Ipanema beaches, Christ the Redeemer statue atop Mount Corcovado and Sugarloaf Mountain. There are some great shots day and night across the city, including some great running stunt shots in the city's infamous favelas.There are some great stunts and some even better cars and car chase scenes...but what really makes this one of the better films in the Fast and The Furious series is the reunion of so many characters...not to mention that we get back to the great on screen chemistry and mutual respect between Brian and Dom, who are both on the run from the law with Mia. This reunites Dom, Brian, Mia, Vince, Taj, Han, Roman, Gisele, Leo and Santos and it introduces both Hobbs (played by Dwayne The Rock Johnson)and Elena as they team up to take down a Brazilian bad guy named Reyes and steal his money.Lots of local flavor this film starts with a prison break for Dom and then a meet up at Vince's in Brazil where we discover Vince has a son. He and Brian bury the hatchet and agree to do a job together for some quick cash. The job goes south, but gives them a common enemy Reyes. Meanwhile they are being hunted by an elite FBI team lead by the Old Testament Hobbs...who after loosing the majority of his team in a street fight to Reyes' men, joins forces with our guys to take him down.If you are a fan of the series or just a fan of great action films..,I think you will love this film like I do.""Mission impossible to mission insanity!""",cgvsluis,"May 31, 2023"
8,Probably my favourite in the franchise!,"Fast & Furious 5 is probably the best one in the franchise so far. It has great action sequences that follow the plot and do not drag on for too long without having any significance to the story. There was a great plot, this time Brain O'Connor finally being on the bad side (something I had been waiting for!). The start led immediately off the last movie, where Dom is broken out of prison. Then Brain, Mia and Dom flee to Rio to hide. There they manage to get the cops attention again by helping Vince pull a job. This time they aren't let off lightly- agent Hobbs is on their tail and he won't rest until they're behind bars. (I won't say much more because I don't want to give anything away!)I was thrilled to see all the old characters from all the movies back together again hatching brilliant mastermind plots and carrying them out so slick and smooth. I found that the first and fourth movie were a bit boring and lacked the amount of action and plot to keep me interested- My favourites were the second and third, though it was a disappointment not to have Vin Diesel in them. The only bring down in Fast Five was the lack of awesome cars like the ones in Tokyo drift. I was kind of looking forward to amazing paint jobs, races and girls like the first few but there were less of them in this one. That was the only disappointment. Came out of the cinema buzzing, more than pleased and excited for the next one! Yes! Live on Fast & Furious franchise!",EmmaGoose,"May 1, 2011"
9,"If you miss all the stars in the previous parts, don't lose it!","I watched the movie few days ago and I enjoyed it very much. The storyline, casting, directing and more specially the team of stars in the previous fasts. In fact, all stars in the previous parts play their role in this part (sometime very short) and gathering such a group of actors in a sequel is unique after ""Godfather 3"".The story is a little different with previous parts and this time, the movie is more similar to movies like ""Italian job"". However the storyline is really interesting and it causes you forget the time. I give 9 because I think that some part of the movie is not very logical (like stealing the police cars scene).Generally I suggest the movie to every racing movies lover and moreover action movies.",behnamgamer,"May 16, 2011"
4,The point where the series is basically going into space,"How many film franchises that struggled to merit strong critical reception to match their copious box office earnings can say that, in the eyes of the masses, they got it right the fifth time? The Fast and the Furious franchise is one of the only ones I can think of in that respect, and this is largely because where most franchises would admit they've run out of gas and are having difficultly finding new ground to cover, The Fast and the Furious buckled off and took a detour when it really needed it. When the previous installment, Fast & Furious, failed to excite even die-hard fans, the result for Fast Five was for writer Chris Morgan to continue to embed that grittier style he toyed with in the fourth film to the franchise's formula. The result is a film that plays more like The Italian Job than a Fast and the Furious film, as the emphasis on cars is downgraded considerably to just one street race at the end and the emphasis on the film is a lot of masculine energy in gun fights, fistfights, and a central heist in the storyline.All of this is well and good, and maybe this is what Fast and the Furious began asking for after the fourth film, but for me, this feels like this series went through metamorphosis and became something it was never supposed to be nor foreseen to be. The action setpieces in the film are all undeniably strong in how well they are articulated - especially one in particular which I'll address later - and the level of energy over the course of two hours, the longest runtime a film in the series has boasted thus far, never depletes or falters. However, Fast Five abandons what made the series so likable in the beginning, and turned it into a glossy action film that feels like the highlight reel from an action film. If the first two films in this series were underground street-racing events, this film is the antiseptic showroom floor of a Ferrari dealership.We follow the same characters we have in previous installments, specifically Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), the cop-turned-street-racer-turned-cop-again-turned-street-racer and his friends Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster). In the opening scene of the film, Brian winds up preventing Dom from going back to jail by causing a large pileup involving the bus Dom is being transported on. Miraculously, nobody else on the bus is hurt and only Dom escapes, with the crew fleeing to Rio de Janeiro. It doesn't take long for U.S. Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) to get hot on Dom's trail, especially when the group hatches a plan to steal $100 million from a corrupt business tycoon named Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida).In order to pull off such a high-caliber operation, they enlist in some old friends Fast and the Furious fans may recognize. Roman Pierce (Tyrese Gibson), a longtime friend of Brian's is one of them, along with both street-racer and criminal opportunist Han (Sang Kung) and street-race organizer Tej Parker (Ludicrous). All together, the gang assembles like Marvel's Avengers and attempts an international crackdown of epic proportions.Fast Five is the point in the franchise where the series goes to space in order to try and desperately invoke some sort of life and new concepts into their tired formula. The cockamamie qualities of Fast Five might as well have the entire cast beaming up to a different planet or a galaxy far, far away for how incredulous things become in this film. That's not to say the earlier films weren't, but Fast & Furious and Fast Five's jarring tonal shifts work to suck all the fun and juvenile sentiments out of a franchise that boasted them like oscillating rims on a fresh new import.The film isn't a total loss, as some scenes are particularly energetic and provide for some comic absurdity. Consider the scene I alluded to earlier, where Brian and Dom are in separate vehicles both hauling a huge, steel safe across a highway with cops on their tale. Just before they get to the highway, however, they are driving through crowded metropolitan streets, turning corners so sharply and quickly that the safe can barely do anything besides topple over, jackknife, and subsequently shatter the walls and fronts of buildings alongside the road. The repeated collisions between the wall and the safe, which is about half the size of a boxcar on a freight train, doesn't make it come loose nor does it cause any disturbance on part of Brian and Dom as the drivers hurling the safe through the streets. Watching this mesmerizing event is like watching the laws of physics slowly implode on themselves, and it occurred to me that if people started elevating from the ground as if they were being sucked into the heavens in that same particular scene, or at any point throughout this film for that matter, the film's own laws of logic would not be compromised.The original two films offered such an inviting and homey quality to the street racers; where the characters had to avoid the cops in the nick of time or face potentially catastrophic penalties and fines. It was the kind of cheery little thing many people in the audience could presumably relate to. The franchise has now extended itself to the point where street-racing and cars have become secondary in hopes to reach a broader audience; how that isn't viewed by the audience as the franchise selling out is a mystery to me. Fast Five is certainly fast in terms of pacing and editing, and it's also indeed the fifth film in this franchise, but just maybe, besides the multiple ""the""'s and ""and""'s misplaced from this film's title, this franchise is running out of gas and is afraid to really show it.",StevePulaski,"Dec 15, 2015"
9,Very fast very cool,"Fast Five is a very cool movie. It is very different from the first parts. Excellence in watching very serious action and great photography. The debut of the great actor Dwayne Johnson, Justin Lynn, Wonderful Director. And I thank the crew. Although the film lacks a bit of clarification, it is still a great movie. I loved it and that is why I give it 9/10.",tamerhaddou-70008,"May 23, 2021"
8,Big. Dumb. Awesome.,"There's a scene about half an hour in to Justin Lin's Fast Five, the latest film in the car racing Fast & Furious franchise, where federal agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) angrily throws a clipboard to the floor as his explanation of something that ""makes sense"". It's this moment that totally sums up Fast Five: a film you can enjoy only by casting logic aside and simply surrendering to the bombastic absurdity you're witnessing. Luckily for those of us able to do this, the film is one of the best examples of big dumb action of the past decade.This series seems to be on something of a one good/one bad streak, with the first, third, and this fifth film all being worthwhile, somewhat original examples of the big-budget summer blockbuster. Picking up directly where the fourth film (2009's Fast & Furious) left off, no time is wasted in getting to the action, and the opening bus assault places us in familiar territory, setting up the mostly unimportant plot with a spectacular, physics-(not to mention logic) defying stunt to get pulses racing. Where the film departs from the tried and true formula of its predecessors however is in blending the heist film genre with the vehicle-based action, and the decision to shake things up was a smart one. The biggest problem with the previous film was that it just seemed kind of pointless, but here Lin uses the 'one last job' team heist plot as an excuse to reunite characters from every previous entry in the franchise, and indeed the film feels like it belongs more to the Ocean's Eleven canon than Fast & Furious. The series' celebrated 'car porn' is still present, yet Lin wisely opts for more variety than ever before, including more direct character conflict (fighting!), and thrilling parkour-esque foot chases across the rooftops of Rio de Janeiro.While it is fun to see so many previous cast members returning to form the team (similarities with 2010's Inception abound here), undoubtedly the greatest part of Fast Five is the introduction of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson as Agent Hobbs, a kind of 'super-cop' sent in to nab only the most wanted criminals. Johnson, looking so absurdly massive that he dwarfs even Vin Diesel, adds an extra layer of beefcake to a film already dripping with testosterone, and he seems to be loving every minute. Throwing out hilariously macho one liners (""Gimme the damn veges!"") in between breaking necks and jumping out of windows, he fits so perfectly into the film that every time he wasn't on screen I found myself just waiting for him to come back. Perhaps my biggest complaint is that he should have had more screen time, but in a film already juggling around a dozen characters, you can't always get what you want. There's always the inevitable sixth entry into the franchise, where hopefully Agent Hobbs will play more of a role.Certainly Fast Five shines in the action scenes, but things aren't so successful if one foolishly tries to think about the logic of the narrative. While it's an interesting move to have Brian (Paul Walker) turning away from his FBI career to help his friend Dom (Diesel), it's hard to see these characters as heroic in any sense. Their desperate self-preservation antics betray a shockingly callous disregard for any innocent bystanders. One would do better to not think about the number of fatalities in the various scenes of destruction around Rio, and even Agent Hobbs and his team, the most obvious 'good-guys', brutally kill their fair share of people. The film attempts to portray all of the people killed as stereotypical corrupt cops and officials, but I did find the amount of violence from the supposed 'heroes' of the film a little distressing. Add to that around 30 minutes of planning for the climactic heist that ultimately becomes unnecessary after a plot twist that changes the whole plan, and the problems with Fast Five's script start to show their presence. But obviously this series was never intended to be admired for its storytelling, and any concerns about the plot are chased away by the excellent action sequences.With Fast Five, Justin Lin has arguably crafted the finest film yet in the franchise. Everyone involved seems to know what this movie needed to be, from the stunning use of practical effects that more than makes up for the awful CGI of the previous film, to the way the ensemble of past characters really pushes the series' constant theme of doing everything for your friends and family. Undoubtedly we will see these characters again, and there is potential for maybe one more outing to round off the story of Dom and Brian. Hopefully Fast Six or whatever silly thing it is eventually titled will match the quality of this entry.",markdroulston,"Jun 15, 2011"

10,A thriller,"What a film. Keeps you on the edge. This is the film that single-handedly got me to give the rest of the series a shot, for better or worse. The scene is beautiful. The actors were brilliant. The suspense, was of just the right dose. Keeps you on the edge and cals you at the same time. I could not ask for more. T's a nice change of pace from the previous films where it abandons the street race angle and goes into the direction of a heist action flick with cars. So yeah, still the best this franchise had, and that's kind of rare for a franchise on its fifth film. The action for the most part is really handled well and a lot of fun to watch. The cast as an ensemble are very charismatic which no doubt makes it more fun for audiences to see a cast that has so much diversity and it's not done with generic stereotypes but just a bunch of people with a common interest.

10,A really large-scale film of the series,"The Fast and the Furious series approached its fifth iteration as a peculiar and diverse project. It seems that there have never been any problems with understanding the themes of the franchise throughout the series. Everyone understands that ""Fast and Furious"" is about cool cars, racing and an interesting story. However, the first four pictures are seriously different from each other, the films focus on different things. And the cast and setting varies from movie to movie. And, probably, it is the fifth ""Fast and Furious"" that sets new and now well-established rules by which the world of fast and furious exists to this day. Only the degree of unreality continues to increase. But this is already a topic for future reviews.The director of the film, Justin Lin, created a unique film that was head and shoulders above the previous pictures in the series, personally in my opinion. This is a really spectacular movie that still manages to border at the junction of the really acceptable and the fantastic.The script of the film was well worked out and did not leave the viewer indifferent. The intrigue of the film reaches its apotheosis by the final chase, which was really cool and exciting. Dragging two cars of a safe through the streets of the city for me personally today is something unimaginable and one of the most memorable excerpts from the entire series of films. The special effects in the movie are cool and realistic. Each scene is thought out to the smallest detail, which allowed us to create a unique atmosphere and breathtaking action scenes.Screenwriters Chris Morgan and Gary Scott Thompson worked out bright characters and an interesting plot that did not let the viewer get bored. The film starred many of the main actors of the franchise, including Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot, Son Gun, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Chris Ludacris Bridges and many others. Each of them created a unique and interesting character, successfully contributed to the overall picture.Heroes know how to love and protect each other, work in a team and laugh, be selfless and collected, do everything in their power for the benefit of the whole team. So, without noticing it, the characters of the picture turn into a family. And the creators are doing an important thing. They show with this picture that the most important thing in life is family. And let this thought of Dominic Toretto acquire a lot of jokes later. The message is really correct. He is important, he teaches you to be able to be a brother, sister, friend, girlfriend. Watching the characters of the picture, the viewer may well learn to be the same selfless in real life, at least at a simple everyday level.The picture takes a new peak. The heroes are finally confronted by a truly worthy opponent, who was embodied on the screen by Dwayne Johnson. The actor played FBI agent Luke Hobbs, who did not leave the audience indifferent with his charisma and impressive physical form. Elsa Pataki was also good. Also a new face in the franchise. The girl plays the role of a policeman from the Hobbs squad. Her separate story also fits perfectly into the overall outline of the picture.The film ""Fast and Furious 5"" is not just a continuation of the series, another film, of which there are many. For me, this is a really strong movie that combines several genres at once. It is perfectly visible how the entire team of creators tried to surpass themselves and shoot a really cool project. In my opinion, it turned out great. Director Justin Lin has created a unique atmosphere that keeps the viewer in suspense throughout the film. And let it be an action movie, there will definitely be a place for drama in it, and the confrontation of the characters with each other will make you watch the development of events with interest.10 out of 10.",alekspredator87,"May 28, 2023"
10,Great movie that's gives that ..,"Think this is when the franchise started to change for the better to be honest.Introducing Dwayne Johnson gave the franchise a massive boost too I think!And ever since this film, the franchise has just got bigger and better!The story is predictable but a lot of fun!It's a very enjoyable film with some really entertaining and truly likeable characters!Vin Diesel is just perfect as Dom!He definitely has the most badass scenes!Paul Walker is also really good and he has great chemistry with Vin!To be honest I think the whole of Dom's team have fantastic chemistry!Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris are especially very funny and entertaining!It's great to see Han back too!Gal Gadot is absolutely gorgeous as Gisele!Dwayne Johnson makes a great addition to the franchise too. Definitely one of the best characters in the whole film to be honest!The action is slick and there are a lot of really cool moments!The finale is very entertaining!!A nice pay off ending too for all the characters!The villain is ok but isn't particularly memorable.This is a truly great instalment in the franchise!",makhureyaw,"Dec 20, 2024"
10,The Greatest Fast and the Furious since the first one and its even better!!!!!,"Im not usually a fan of sequels, considering a lot of them are not as good as the original, this was indeed the case with the Fast and the Furious franchise, the first one was purely original and fun to watch while the sequels were not as good. This movie however proved me wrong. This Fast and the Furious story takes place after the fourth movie and picks up right from where they left it off and immediately finishes off with little time to take in. Dominic Played by Vin Diesal has broken out of prison with the help of Paul Walker and Doms sister. The overall story is not the most original thing I've ever heard of but in a way its a nice turn for the series considering the second movie felt more like an episode then a movie, i have no idea what the third movie was, and the fourth was a repeat of the first movie. This time around, Paul is not a cop but rather a fugitive on the run, i really liked this turn for him because i often wondered how many times could they allow him to return to being a cop. Many characters from the past movies come back here, so if you haven't seen the past movies, you will be lost as to who's who and whats their role to play in the story. New to this story is Dwayne Johnson who plays a ruthless but hardcore villain who is determined to capture Dom and his group. I gotta say, this is one of the only film roles i have seen Dwayne in that i actually like, i think he finally found the role that may define the rest of his career. The fight between Dwayne and Vin was indeed the Arnold and Sylvester fight everyone has been waiting for since the 80's. The movie has tons of girls in bikinis, fast cars, and a lot more action this time around. My only complaint if anything is the beginning, i kind of wish they hadnt rushed it like they did, im the kind of person that enjoys a good introduction, and the beginning was alittle too much emphasis, so thats about it everything else was fantastic. Also the shocking revelation in the end may send shivers down hardcore fans of the genre, others will not understand it, but i will say for those of you who have seen the past movies, you will get a real kick out of the ending, for those of you who haven't, see the past ones before seeing this one. If you have already given up on the franchise, watch this movie to change your frame of mind, it will make a difference.",yora217,"May 6, 2011"

4,Just more of the same,"""Fast Five,"" so named because it is the fifth entry in the highly lucrative ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, finds our intrepid band of car-racing criminals, played by Vin Diesel , Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster, masterminding a heist against a South American crime lord played by Joaquim de Almeida . Wayne Johnson joins the cast as an American Secret Service agent hot on the trio's trail.Replete with wafer-thin characters, corny one-liners, substandard acting and muddled moral messaging, the movie culminates in a spectacular, though really rather ludicrous, car chase through the streets of Rio de Janeiro.

8,Summer truly has begun!,"Summer begins April 29.And yes, yes it did.This movie was friggin' awesome! I thought Fast & Furious was the best of the franchise, but Fast Five has completely blown all of its predecessors out of the water! Despite it completely breaking all laws of physics (especially including a scene where a small muscle car manges to trip a bus over) the movie was awesome. This makes a Fast and the Furious movie worth watching! Being a huge fan, I loved this movie to death.Never has a movie made me sweat in the theater seat and pump me full of so much adrenaline that I almost peed my pants.They drive a SAFE through the STREET!The other awesome part of this film is that it's a Fast and the Furious movie with a story and more depth to the characters. The previous movies were meant solely for their action and this one does that, too... Plus some more!I got the honorable pleasure to see this pulse pounding film in IMAX and it was worth every cent. I suggest that, for the full effect, you see it in IMAX as well.

It wasn't just a whole bunch of cars everywhere it actually had a good plot and a really good twist. The Rock was hot as always and he did a really good job in the film as well.

You won't be disappointed and neither will your local venue as you guzzle through 3 boxes of popcorn. Otherwise, if you enjoy: a) Plots that don't make you face palm yourself. b) Actors that can actually act. c) Movies that adhere to the physical laws of this universe. d) Dialogue which doesn't make you roll your eyes every 15 minutes.STAY AWAY! It was a pain to watch if you came in there with expectations of a decent film, but if you came in there to see crazy stunts and babes then you probably won't leave too disappointed.

9,Everything You Want In This Genre,"This movie takes everything that was exciting and thrilling about the previous installments and brings it all together and even in many ways elevates it. The start isn't anything too spectacular , but the moment they bring all of the characters together for the mission is absolutely epic. Sometimes when franchises try to merge characters from one movie with another it is clunky and underwhelming, but all these characters truly come together to form a family. The dialogue is fantastic and the comedy is on point. Every character is used in a way that allows the film to progress nearly without flaw.The only downside I would argue is that the villain was extremely average and checked every box off as a caricature of the corrupt, money laundering, South American organized crime leader. Still, the fact the movie was as fantastic as it was even with a middling villain proves how fantastic it truly was.",ThereelscoopwithKK,"Feb 28, 2023"

5,Mildly interesting heist film,"thefilmsmith.com If you're a film critic aiming to be taken seriously you draw up reviews of awesome little-known films like Night of the Hunter and level sniper shots at the latest Transfomers flick. Anything heavily marketed to mass audiences is normally regarded as terrible before official screenings begin, and that sentiment isn't without its reasons. But even the most erudite critic has a guilty pleasure, and mine happens to be any film that tries to do as much real special effect work as possible before going to the computer, which is what made me curious about Fast Five.Paul Walker and Vin Diesel return to the franchise that launched their careers, this time hiding in Rio de Janeiro when a 100 million dollar heist presents itself.Despite featuring characters who are notable only for their attractiveness and angry faces, this 2 hour heist film manages to milk some character development. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson hams it up nicely as the DEA agent chasing Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, and Walker is mercifully not given many lines. Instead, director Justin Lin introduces the characters with an impressive train heist and incorporates quieter moments that don't clash with the rest of the film.The actual heist sequence illustrated in the film's trailer is what intrigued me, but within the film it's delivered with mixed results. A scrapyard somewhere made a killing off the film, with plenty of vehicles getting mashed, crashed, and thrashed with nary a digital effect interrupting the fiasco (at least blatantly; it definitely played a supporting role). Kudos. After a while though, the auto body kill count becomes numbing and never manages to deliver a cherry on top of this metal mash-up sundae (think the truck flip from The Dark Knight).Despite being the fifth sequel in a car racing franchise that still bears of the scars of its adolescence, it isn't a bad action film. Sure, the film has some bad moments (it still retains its awkward homoerotic tension between angry ogre men), but overall it's bearable.If you're interested in the film's special effects, it might be worth your time. Other than that, I'm not sure why else someone would want to see it. Vin Diesel's shiny head? -Remington Smith",electrablind,"Apr 29, 2011"

9,Great movie!!,"Fast Five is where the Fast & Furious franchise truly hit its stride, transforming from street-racing drama into a high-octane, heist-centered action epic.

The stakes feel higher, the scale is grander, and the film blends humor, spectacle, and intensity in near-perfect harmony.Overall, Fast Five is an absolute blast from start to finish and is one of the best entries in the Fast & Furious franchise.

Shifting from street racing to high-octane heist action, the film expands the scope and scale of the franchise while retaining its core themes of family, loyalty, and adrenaline-fueled thrills.PlotThe story follows Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), and Mia (Jordana Brewster) as they flee to Rio de Janeiro after breaking Dom out of custody. In Brazil, they plan an ambitious heist to steal $100 million from a corrupt businessman, Hernan Reyes, while being pursued by relentless DSS agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson). To pull off the job, they assemble a team of familiar faces from previous films, setting the stage for explosive action.Action & DirectionJustin Lin's direction is sleek and energetic, with well-choreographed sequences and a sense of scale that outdoes its predecessors.

9,Just Ate my Own Words.,"The 1970 trailer for the biker classic, Hell's Belles summed it up perfectly: ""Hip chicks with an itch for the kind of action that takes a lot of man﻿ to scratch!"" That same mentality prevails in all of the F&F series and as I've always said before: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.In my Thor review, I slated Fast Five without seeing it; and now, I stand here before my legion of fans, holding my head (and spiky bonce) in shame. They say that no one talks about Fight Club, true. But when it's Fast & Furious, remember one thing: Leave your brain at home and set your motor to auto-cruise. Hey, I'm even 100% sure that NASA's finest could figure out the logistics and physics of cutting open the side of a fast moving train, but this is what F5 does: It's so ludicrous that you just have to give up and suspend disbelief until you come back to reality (haha, I made an Inception joke there, nice!) Fast Five does what it says on the poster and doesn't allow you to breathe a lot. Within 5 mins of the opening scene, we see Vin Diesel's Dom, being rescued by his family (whilst he's in a moving prison vehicle no less!) And a credit to the writers, they shift gears as quickly as they can and take us to Rio De Janeiro (yes, not a CGI city, but actually Rio, no orange Macaws plugging 3G crap, thank God!) What we then get after, is a fairly sane plot of a corrupt official Reyes (the always cool Joaquin De Almeida) who seems to have more money than God. After this Kingpin kills a member of the wannabe Ocean's 11 crew, Dominic wants revenge as only he knows how! Except, he didn't bargain on Special FBI bounty hunter, Hobbs (Dwayne The Rock Johnson). As Paul Walker's Brian O'Conner says: ""Vey Old Testament"". Say what you like about wrestlers-cum-actors, but DJ is better than 50 Cent, in that he actually took acting lessons and is the best thing about F5. In fact, Vin Diesel has been in this franchise for a while now, and wisely takes a back seat for the Rock and his motormouth do the talking. And this is what I liked: We're promised a showdown with 2 behemoths (albeit 3, if you count Vin's belly). While I do like the Bourne films, those frigging quick cuts in the action is off putting; but here, Justin Lin keeps it old school and even out does the Expendables and its constant clumsiness, by giving us a solid beat-down between the Tooth Fairy & XXX. It's A-Team style, punch-em-in-the-face with no suplex in-jokes. The Rock is in phenomenal shape and twice the size of Diesel (I for one, cannot wait until 2012 when he does a one-off reunion with WWE and takes out John Cena!) The women in F&F have 2 purposes: They're good wheel drivers and wield wrenches for self-defense. On the other hand, the ones who aren't allowed to speak on camera, simply let their finely tuned asses and over-the-crotch hot pants do the talking (not that I'm complaining you understand)...Gisele (Gal Gadot) is a skinny chick with balls and needs to eat more burgers if she wants to convince Sports Illustrated, she can cut it on their front cover. Elsa ""Tacky"" Pataky is good as Elena, the cop with a ""nice smile"" and wished she'd been in a bikini instead. But as always, my heart goes to Jordana Brewster as Mia. She'll never win an Oscar (like she gives a rat's ass!) but remains as beautiful as ever (and appeared in season 2 of Chuck, so clearly she has taste).There was great interplay with the rest of the cast too, especially with Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Chris Bridges) and their schoolboy put downs. And with a movie that takes itself seriously with action and very little CGI, a smattering of humour is always welcome in my books.A few observations I noticed: Had Dominic Toretto and his motley crew watched Top Gear UK, they would've known that a TVR is the only car that could beat a speed camera (duh!) Also, don't even tell me that no-one has played Modern Warfare 2, because anyone who has (veteran, cough!) will be familiar with the Favela chapter and here, it's brought to the screen with some real ferocity, right down to the roof top chases. And just to reinforce the demographic F5 is aimed out, look no further than Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, which they clearly emulated in the last 20 mins. And there were 2 other moments I cried (the first being Elena) - Mia driving a GT40 and Dom's 1970 Charger getting crushed (noooooo!) And if you're going to acquire the top sports car in the Western Hemisphere, at least have the decency to grace us with a band of attractive women to double the viewing pleasure! As my good American cyber friend Ashley said: ""Stick around after the end credits"". F&F6 is on the cards; but F5 could've tied-up its loose ends very neatly. I gave this movie 5/5 because it's F for Fun and after you leave, you'll think you've just been on the best amusement park ride, ever! Whether Justin Lin is the right man for the Terminator reboot is debatable - (don't get me wrong, I'm happy for the Far East Asian brother to hit the big time, and that Sung Kan gets a love interest who's out of his race!) but if Justin himself can contact me, we need to sit down and do some serious talking!",SkidMcCormick,"May 7, 2011"
8,Maybe Too Fast !!,"Fast Five was exactly what I expected. Fast, lots of action and car chases.At some point events made no sense to me. and i think maybe the reason for that is the the new characters have no depth to them.But on the other hand if you are a fan of big car chases and explosions, you could have a lot of fun watching this.The acting was pretty good. Van diesel was my favorite as always. If watch the trailer you will see that its pretty much the same thing in the movie. i mean all of the important scenes are in the tailer.But this film is the best out of all of them.

Released in 2011, the film directed by Justin Lin, took the franchise to new heights, both critically and commercially. Here are some reasons why Fast Five stands out as an exceptional movie.*Innovative Plot Twist*Fast Five deviates from the traditional street racing formula of the previous films, instead opting for a more complex and intriguing plot. The movie brings together Dominic Toretto's (Vin Diesel) crew and Luke Hobbs' (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) team in a high-stakes heist in Rio de Janeiro. This fresh take on the franchise's narrative helps to revitalize the series and sets the stage for future installments.*Well-Developed Characters*The film boasts a talented ensemble cast, with each character bringing their unique personality and skills to the table. The chemistry between the actors is undeniable, making their interactions on screen both authentic and engaging. The addition of Luke Hobbs, a relentless and charismatic federal agent, adds a new layer of complexity to the story and creates an intriguing dynamic with the rest of the cast.*Heart-Pumping Action Sequences*Fast Five is renowned for its adrenaline-fueled action sequences, which are expertly choreographed and visually stunning. From the opening train heist to the climactic vault chase, the film's action scenes are relentless, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats. The incorporation of impressive stunts, cleverly designed set pieces, and innovative camera work elevates the film's action sequences to new heights.*Emotional Resonance*Beneath its action-packed surface, Fast Five explores themes of family, loyalty, and redemption. The film delves into the complexities of Dominic Toretto's character, revealing a deeper sense of vulnerability and humanity. The relationships between the characters are genuine and heartfelt, making the film's emotional moments truly resonate with the audience.*Technical Achievements*From a technical standpoint, Fast Five is a masterclass in filmmaking. The cinematography is crisp and vibrant, capturing the stunning landscapes of Rio de Janeiro. The sound design is equally impressive, with a pulsating soundtrack that perfectly complements the film's high-octane action sequences. The editing is seamless, ensuring that the film's pacing remains relentless and engaging throughout.*Cultural Significance*Fast Five's impact extends beyond the screen, as it played a significant role in revitalizing the franchise and paving the way for future installments. The film's success can be attributed to its ability to evolve and adapt to changing audience preferences, while remaining true to the spirit of the original film. Fast Five's influence can be seen in many subsequent action films, cementing its status as a landmark movie in the genre.In conclusion, Fast Five is an exceptional movie that exceeds expectations in every aspect. With its innovative plot twist, well-developed characters, heart-pumping action sequences, emotional resonance, technical achievements, and cultural significance, it's no wonder that Fast Five is widely regarded as one of the best movies in the Fast and Furious franchise.",phyvffvpr,"Dec 19, 2024"
3,Glorifying murder?,"The amount of plot holes in this movie make it difficult to classify it as an action movie. Much has been written here about the absurdity of the script. Just to give one extra example: sneaking into a police station to examine a safe by blowing up the men's room and breaking a man size hole in the wall, and still letting your audience believe it went unnoticed; it is to silly for words. So, I tried to look at it as a comedy, but it didn't fit either. The only objection I want to add to the list is the way Luke Hobbs shoots a defenceless man begging for help, even though he is the bad guy in this movie. I know, it's the American fairytale, the good guys shoot the bad guys and everybody live happily ever after, but this is the glorification of brutal murder. You can't do that, not even in silly movies like this.",Arconada,"Jun 22, 2013"

The chemistry between the cast, including Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, and Tyrese Gibson, adds depth to the film. With its pedal-to-the-metal pace and mind-blowing action sequences, ""Fast Five"" is a must-see for fans of the franchise.

9,Still Shining Bright,"First of all, let me say, BRAVO for the addition of Dwayne 'the Rock' Johnson to the cast of ""Fast & Furious 5"" by director Justin Lin. If any director knows how to keep a franchise fresh and invigorating for the viewer, it is him.The storyline is excellent and by the end, the viewer is saying to himself, ""what the heck?"" The twists and turns of F&F5 keep you guessing and wanting more. The story takes off right as ""Fast & Furious"" ended, with Dom heading to prison. But what you see at the beginning of F&F5 will blow you out of your seat if you haven't seen it already. It was amazing.The addition of the character Luke Hobbs (played by the Rock), an antagonist to Dominic Toretto (played by Vin Diesel) is a perfect casting job. Even as an authority figure, Hobbs is a very likable character. Kudos! If ""Fast & Furious 6"" is as amazing as this film, we are all in for a treat. And anticipation for ""Fast & Furious 7"" just as much, I hear that Jason Statham will be appearing in that film. Think of it as an ""Expendables"" on really fast wheels.",Hollywood_Yoda,"May 18, 2013"
10,Fast Five,"Loved it! It's the Fast and the Furious people! If you loved the first, you can't NOT love this one. They are all ridiculous, over the top and unrealistic but who cares?!? It's so entertaining to watch and having all the cast back was awesome! Practically every hot car makes and appearance and then of course you have the hot men :) Vin Diesel and Paul Walker had great on screen chemistry that made me love them even more. Adding back the rest of the old cast members made for a great humor addition to the movie. Turn off your analytical brain and just sit back and enjoy the ride! Fun!",lindseyholcombe18,"Apr 30, 2011"

9,100% adrenaline,"""Fast Five"" is so far the best in the franchise with a big gap. In this film you really see the idea of bringing the saga to be an automotive action franchise, and it does it great. This film brings together the main characters of the franchise in an exceptional way and the links between them work perfectly. I really liked the in-depth introduction by Elena, Hobbs and the greater involvement of Gisele. The plot of this film has entertained me a lot and I think for the most part thanks to the beautiful Brazilian setting. The soundtracks of the film are perfect for both the environment and the various moments of the film. It's very good plot writing and how the various characters get involved in the shot and the costumes are perfect for the setting. Lin's direction confirms or even exceeds the excellent work done with the previous 2 films. In my opinion, Vin Diesel plays his character better and better, Paul Walker is a great actor, I liked the performances of Nelsa Pataky and Dwayne Johnson. Gal Gadot confirms herself as a great actress and plays Gisele very well. I love the Roman-Tej couple, especially for their actors, Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris, perfect for the role. The hilarious Tego Leo-Santos pair also works perfectly. I also liked the return of Vince, which works well with writing. The ending of the film is spectacular with an incredible soundtrack, I love it, I really enjoy it. The mid-credit is incredibly adrenaline, leaves you speechless. I can't wait to see the sixth film from one of the most spectacular and underrated sagas in film history..
Rating: 9.6/10.",montanaromichael,"May 18, 2024"
8,The pinnacle of its franchise,"I think it's safe to say that it's Fast Five where The Fast and the Furious saga finally found its groove. It managed to keep all that was good about the franchise beforehand and combine it with the high stakes adrenaline rush of an international caper spy genre.The returning goodness still culminates in Paul Walker and Vin Diesel playing Brian O'Conner and Dominic Toretto, two street racing experts who are set to face the world no matter what it throws at them. Plus, you know, fast cars, hot women, killer soundtrack. All that good stuff. Plus Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto. What's not to like.But then the new good stuff. First of all, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as a hardened federal agent going after Brian and Dom. Fantastic casting that allows you just that hint of incredulity. Because, you know, The Rock is larger than life.But this film also sees the return of many side characters from previous films. Gal Gadot as Gisele, Sung Kang as Han, Tyrese Gibson as Roman, and so on. All beloved characters, brought together at last to pull off a heist. Which was a great genre for this franchise to evolve into.If I had to gripe about something, I'd say the villain is really forgettable. And I'm not talking about Johnson's character. I'm talking about the mob boss, the target of the heist. Can't even remember his name. Still, he's not the most important part of the movie. Not even close.Fast Five is everything a good Fast & Furious film should be and then some. My personal favourite.",Vartiainen,"May 17, 2020"
10,Five Five review,"The is one of the film l found entertaining and thrilling, l always enjoy watching it repeatedly and countless times. I always give credit and thumps up to the producers for coming up with such an idea to produce that film. I personally think producers in the field should produce something like this that suits the current film fraternity considering how technology is moving fast. Fast five film is a film that you can even enjoy watching countless times especially when you feeling bored or sad...l just wish if they can produce another film expressing the same theme. Thumps up to the producers and actors!",raymarongedza,"Dec 19, 2024"
10,There we go,"So I went to watch Thor today and it was OK but then right after I went into another screen where Fast Five was playing and then thats when I felt like I paid to watch a movie.Let me quickly go through the first four films. The Fast and The Furious introduced the idea of an action film that can be done with cars readily available on the streets like the Mitsubishi Eclipse or Honda Civic. 2 Fast 2 Furious introduced the repeated villain in the franchise which is the powerful drug-lord. Fast and Furious brought in the crazy action but somehow wasn't able to expand its potential. Tokyo Drift was a complete abomination and felt completely unnecessary.Fast Five really seals in the gaps and blends all the best elements from the previous 3 (I will not include Tokyo Drift in this!!!) and wow, its a great theatrical experience.Rio was used as a setting and even though that's becoming a little played out, it's still brilliant because it allows for brilliant action sequences. Whether it's a rooftop chase in the favela, a motorcade ambush by a favela gang or an intense high speed chase sequence with two cars hauling a vault (you saw that in the trailer no big spoiler).Overall everything is so much better, character development, plot lines and story lines, action sequences and even emotion. It does go Hollywood though meaning there is a good amount of suspension of disbelief.I loved it, its good not only as a Fast and Furious film but as a film in its own merit. It took 4 films before but it finally hit the mark.",arnieiam,"May 6, 2011"
5,I expected more action and it was too long,"After I have read all the positive international reviews I thought this must be a real action movie and above all the best one of this franchise. But I was wrong because in my opinion there were only three great respectable scenes with full of adrenaline. The remaining story was too long. The running time could have been reduced at maximal 95 minutes. There were dialogs where I felt nearly asleep. The characters and actors didn't convince me. Then I missed a fresh and intelligent story with intriguing, mysterious or adventure elements to take me definitely on a great ride in Rio. The story is so simply sticked as in The Expendables or Swordfish. That's why this movie is far away from blockbusters such as DIE HARD, TERMINATOR, JAMES BOND or THE BOURNE IDENTITY series. I am so disappointed and I won't give another chance in future. Too overrated on IMDb. My vote is slow five out of ten.",Luigi Di Pilla,"Sep 11, 2011"

8,Fast Five Blu-Ray Review,"It was quite serendipitous that I caught Fast Five in the theatres. There were over ten of us planning to go watch the much-talked-about Bridesmaids but when my car group got there (late), we had three friends trying to save like 15 seats on a long weekend—wasn't happening. There were still seats left in the first few rows of the theatre but I'd personally rather not watch the movie if I had to strain my neck for 2 hours and potentially feel sick. So me and a buddy volunteered to leave the group and go watch another flick that was airing around the same time. And that's how I ended up sitting (in very decent seats) in the cinema showing Fast Five.Fast Five is the latest instalment to the ""Fast"" movie series and the third film of the franchise directed by Justin Lin (Fast & Furious, Tokyo Drift). I have to say that Lin has successfully revived this series that I thought was over and done with, when the Diesel-less 2 Fast and 2 Furious came out. The director has managed to not only revive the series but has been able to evolve it into a franchise he can call his own now. It's been over a decade since the first film came out and Fast Five comes full circle and basically pays homage to all the previous movies with almost all the ""Fast"" characters coming back (some characters meeting for the first time)—it feels like one big high school reunion.The story takes off exactly right where the 4th film left off, where, Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker, Takers) and Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster, Fast & Furious) are going to rescue Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel, who's also the producer of the film)—in very appropriate ""Fast"" style—from the prison bus. They end up in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil where they plan to pull one last job, a big heist which involves taking $100 million dollars from a drug kingpin and his army of corrupt cops. All this, while being hunted down by a bad ass DSS federal agent, Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson, who's last film is ironically entitled, Faster) and his crew.Continue reading the full 'Movie Review' and 'Blu-Ray Review' at: http://www.thetvsamurai.com/2011/10/fast-five-blu-ray-review.html",TheTVSamurai,"Jan 25, 2012"

9,The 5th one is better then the first 4.,I did not like the first movie of The fast and the furious. I like 2 fast 2 furious. And I like The fast and the furious Tokyo drift. And I like Fast and furious new model original parts. But this is better. This movie has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has a lot of action. 7.3 is a good ratting. But this is such a great movie that 7.3 is underrating it. I give it 9. It is a great movie. Furious 7 is a better. But still this a great movie. If you like action movies then you will like this movie. This is a movie that you should see. I is a very cool movie. If you do not like this movie that's OK with movie.

9,Grade A junk ... I love it,"The fifth movie in this series is where it really hits its stride. It brings together all the major characters from the first 4 movies into one plot line that largely abandons to street racing angle in favour of a really silly heist plot peppered with several outstanding action sequences. This is a vast improvement because the plot and characters have always been the weak point of this series, so de-emphasizing them in favour of action provides a winning formula. While the action sequences are not exactly realistic, they are grounded in practical stunt work and not a ton of CGI, so they feel more realistic than they have any right to do. This is really top quality junk, and I wish we got more big budget action films like it.",rdoyle29,"Sep 5, 2017"

9,AWESOME! That's all I can say.,"AWESOME! That's all I can say. The action is great, the story is great, the music is great, the cars are again out of this world (ok, not really :-)), the character interaction and character development are great and just as in part 1, it's the 'team' that makes the movie for me. A team which I as a viewer want to be a part of.Where they started falling into the sequel trap with releasing sub-par movies after the first one, come part 4 they completely turned it around. By bringing back the original cast and by adding some much needed character development and 'real' characters they instantly created a blockbuster hit. And now part 5 is even better imho. They expanded on the back stories of the characters and the story of the movie as a whole. A story which I believe is better than the fourth movie and even rivals the first one. Keep in mind though that we are still not talking about Oscar material, but as a summer, sorry ... spring :-), blockbuster it comes highly recommended.If they continue like this I definitely wouldn't mind if they made 5 more of these.",Dschadir,"May 7, 2011"

10,They're Fast and they're furious.,Fast Five opens with a daring jailbreak. and from that point on it sets the tone for the movie. Fast Action incredible stunts and credible story to keep everything moving smoothly. Dominic Toretto has been broken out of jail by Former FBI agent Brian O'Connor and Toretto's sister Mia. Once they free Dominic they're on the run for their lives. their race for freedom takes them to Brazil broke and penniless Brian and Mia wait for Dom at the home of a old friend Vince. While they wait for Dom Vince offers Brian a chance at a job the job is to steal three cars off a moving train. Brian and Mia both take the job and join Vince as they move to do the job Dom shows up and helps them do the job. things go wrong from there. the cars are under DEA protection and the gang double crosses Dom Brian and Mia. Mia escapes in one car that holds a secret and Brian and Dom fight for their lives in a breathtaking scene. In the End three DEA agents are dead and the DEA brings in Hobbs a old style gunfighter type of agent he's relentless he's ruthless and he's targeted Dom and his friends for the deaths of his friends. meanwhile Dom and Brian find out Mia is pregnant. On the run with enemies around them Dominic Toretto decides it's time for one last job and then after that disappear forever. Needing help they gather the ultimate superteam for the ultimate heist. and meanwhile the supercop Hobbes is closing in on our band of heroes.The pace is fast the twists are surprising and the acting is solid. this is the best entry in the F and F franchise yet. If Fast Five is this good I wonder how they can top it with Furious six? Oh and stay after the credits for a scene that'll set up furious six and make you want to see that one. Fast five has all the power of a 1970 dodge Charger and all the speed of a Dodge Challenger worth seeing if this is your type of movie.,bluesman-20,"May 12, 2011"
10,"The Return of Muscle, Schemes, and Screaming Tires","Dom and his crew of illegal mechanics are back in full force. You'd think after four movies, these guys would be pimping out walkers in a retirement home, but nope-they're taking over Brazil with more sweat than a wrestling match and more roaring engines than an episode of Dragon Ball Z. It's beautiful, it's brutal, and thank God there's enough popcorn to survive the ride.Dwayne Johnson's arrival in the franchise is like adding a hacked DLC to GTA. This guy is a walking wall, a beast hunting down Dom and his crew with the finesse of a jackhammer. The Vin Diesel vs. Dwayne Johnson fight? It's less of a regular brawl and more like Godzilla vs. King Kong. The result? You're glued to your seat, holding your breath, and begging for more.Fast & Furious 5 is where logic gets put on airplane mode and physics gets kicked out like it failed its high school exams. A scene where two cars drag a massive bank vault through the streets of Rio? Not only does it happen, but it's shot so intensely you'll almost want to try it with your own Clio and a public trash bin. Spoiler: It won't work.The movie sticks to its roots: stunning women, illegal street races, and soap-opera-level one-liners. Jordana Brewster is still there to remind Dom that he's human (even though he looks like the Terminator), and Elsa Pataky brings just enough charm to balance out all the testosterone-fueled chaos.The plot? It's not exactly Les Misérables. You're here to watch cars blow up, bad guys get wrecked, and cheap betrayals spice things up. Justin Lin knows that subtlety is for arthouse films-here, we want visuals that slap and testosterone that drips off the screen.Fast & Furious 5 is unapologetic blockbuster entertainment. It doesn't aim to be smart; it aims to blow your mind, and damn, it does just that. Between Dwayne Johnson smashing everything, Vin Diesel growling like a bear, and car chases that defy Newton's laws, you'll leave the theater with an irresistible urge to buy a car and install neon lights under the chassis.",OniFR,"Feb 7, 2025"
8,"Fast Five brings the action, beloved old characters, exciting new ones, and a whole lot of fun to the Fast franchise and the heist genre.","Fast 4 and Fast 5 are the best of the Fast & Furious franchise. Fast 4 redeemed the series after the failure of Tokyo Drift by bringing back Vin Diesel and the cast and family of the first film. Then Fast 5 expands and adds to the crew with fan-favorite characters from across the series, including Han (Kang), Roman (Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Gisele (Gadot), and more. The Toretto family plans a massive heist to buy their freedom but hot on their tale is Dwayne Johnson's Hobbs, a perfect foil to Diesel's Toretto. The face-off between these characters is epic! Fast Five's bonkers action is a little more grounded than later entries, but it's still outrageous fun. It feels kind of like The Italian Job, directed by Michael Bay. Fast Five launched the Fast Franchise into another decade of insane stunts and stories with great characters and commitment to embracing its cheesy awesomeness.",Paragon240,"Sep 17, 2022"

That's the thing about these movies; they may be ridiculous, but they are soooooooo much fun! It is clear that everybody on this film had an absolute blast and I loved every minute of it!With that being said, the thing that I like about the series now is that it isn't just focused on the cars. I feel like the earlier installments, while still fun, were somewhat all style and no substance. Yes, I know that I'm talking about the Fast and the Furious movies, but it felt like this one had an actual plot outside of fast cars racing down the street. It was entertaining; it wasn't just nice looking.As said before, the actors all had a lot of fun with this movie. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, of course, are the guys that heads the crew, while the rest of the crew are their usual, wisecracking and fun-loving selves. I particularly enjoyed seeing Gal Gadot pre-Wonder Woman. This time, they are joined by one of the most entertaining people in the acting business, Dwayne Johnson. Johnson was made for a series like this, and he gives it all he's got in a various amount of action set pieces.My one complaint is that the villain felt a little one-note. I didn't feel like there was any motivation for him, other than revenge. But, that is only a minor complaint, as the film itself was great!Definite recommend!",byrann_gowan,"Aug 18, 2018"
5,At Least the Cars Were Cool,"Fast Five, another installment to the blockbuster series starring Vin Diesel, gave me mixed feelings. To organize my thoughts, I'll put the aspects of the film in a pros and cons list. Pros: The camera work surprisingly wasn't irritating to watch, as one might expect of a movie revolved around car racing. The action sequences, although far-fetched (as any action movie), was inventive and clouded with clear sound effects that fit the scenes. Cons: The whole movie seemed like a competition of who could deliver the most one-liners. The screenplay was limited, saying only what the audience expected them to say. The characters were shallow and stereotypic; no character stood out from the rest. On a 10 star scale, this movie would fairly deserve 5 stars.",ku2244,"May 2, 2011"
8,The best in the series,"Fast and Furious Series that brings all the players together. Especially Dwayne Johnson, who came into the film, is one of my favorites. The man is really like steel, the role of the man is integrated into his body.The beginning and end of the movie consists of the most legendary scenes. Especially the initial train scene is legendary. The audience was surprised with the mind games in the scenario in the final money box scene, it was really successful to have such mind games in such an action movie.Also, one of the scenes I liked most in the movie was the part where Spanish and Portuguese people came to Brazil 500 years ago. The message about life there was very meaningful.I wish there would be ten number movies if there were no sexually explicit scenes in such beautiful movies.",drmuhammedsamiduru,"Apr 22, 2020"

9,Fast Five: Revving Up the Franchise to a New Level,"Fast Five is a shot of pure adrenaline straight to the heart of the Fast and Furious franchise. This 2011 installment doesn't just get the engine running again; it throws it into hyperdrive. It's the first film of the 2010s where proportion of the franchise to truly capture the spirit of the early films while simultaneously forging its own path, and arguably stands as the best since the initial The Fast and the Furious and 2 Fast 2 Furious.The franchise has always been about action, but Fast Five cranks it up to 11. From the incredible highway heist that kicks things off to the jaw-dropping safe drag at the film's climax, the action is bigger, bolder, and more inventive than anything we'd seen before. But what elevates Fast Five above mere spectacle is that it doesn't sacrifice story for the explosions. Instead, it crafts a truly compelling narrative that we can buy into, driven by stakes we understand, and characters we've invested in for a decade.The return of familiar faces like Tej (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) and Roman (Tyrese Gibson) is a welcome addition, bringing back some of the playful banter and camaraderie that was sorely missed. And then there's the introduction of Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) - (And one of my two Non-Toretto Crew related characters of the series) - a character that immediately steals every scene he's in. His raw power and unwavering dedication to the law are a fantastic foil to Dom (Vin Diesel) and the crew. This, alongside the entrance of Elena (Elsa Pataky), a local officer who gets caught in the criminal cross hairs, adds a completely fresh dynamic. Elena's interactions with Dom build a captivating and intriguing relationship that adds another layer of depth.Mia's pregnancy adds an emotional undercurrent to the high-octane action, while the decision to set the film in the vibrant, sun-soaked streets of Rio de Janeiro provides a stunning new backdrop. The villain, Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), is a genuinely credible threat, a corrupt businessman with far-reaching power, making the stakes feel higher than ever. The masterstroke here is the seamless weaving together of characters from previous films, making this feel like a culmination of the franchise's journey so far, and a true ensemble movie. It was also a brilliant move to play with the established lore of the franchise.And that ending, the reveal that Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) was alive the whole time, is a masterclass in cliffhanger storytelling. It ignites a fire of badass anticipation, setting the stage for even grander things to come.Fast Five isn't just a great action movie; it's a defining moment for the franchise. It finds the perfect balance between over-the-top absurdity and genuine heart, cementing its place as one of the best of the series. This movie understands what makes the Fast saga so exciting, and it delivers on all fronts. It's a thrill ride that leaves you breathless, satisfied, and desperately wanting more. For all these reasons, Fast Five earns a well-deserved 9/10.",douglasc11,"Jan 5, 2025"

10,Fast Five Gives you exactly what you want,"Every year, moviegoers can depend on the franchise to release an entry with every character the audience wants (whether dead or alive), six of the most ridiculous and implausible car scenes you'll ever see in your life, and at least one scene where Vin Diesel/Paul Walker's acting is so bad that the audience literally laughs at him in a serious scene. Every summer, an academic on his way to that new French subtitled film that ""the New Yorker just loved!"" scoffs at me as I march to the theater, but why? I can't think of a series that more successfully gives the audience exactly what they pay $12 to see. Five out of Five stars!

8,A Much needed rejig for the franchise,"Fast Five aka Fast & Furious 5 or Fast & Furious 5: Rio Heist is a heist action film directed by Justin Lin and written by Chris Morgan. The film stars Vin Diesel, Late Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang, Tego Calderon, Don Omar, Gal Gadot, Dwayne Johnson, and Joaquim de Almeida.The film is the fifth installment in fast and furious series.This film is one of the best film of the series and with the introduction of Dwayne Johnson has gave the much needed boost to the series and also the credit should be given to makers by instilling new life in the series by introducing heist along with some car chases as the car racing were getting too monotonous. This step had not only increased the viewers base but also leased a new life in the franchise.The plot and the screenplay is flatly predictable but is still enjoyable, the funny scenes here and there will keep you entertained and the fast paced screenplay will keep you engaged.The stunts and action in the film is marvelous and few of the action scenes and stunts can be called as the major highlights of the film.Acting is good to decent and almost all the characters were honest and dedicated to their character, the only drawback which i felt was that the character of the antagonist in the film was not cooked properly or was under shadowed in the hoard of another actors. This role should've been developed more precisely and if they would have done the film could've been more grand, but sadly in this film the villain looked too week and isn't memorable.Climax of the film is also predictable as it's plot but is very entertaining and gives a satisfying pleasure. If you are a fan of fast and furious series or if you are a fan of heist series then this is the film for you. A much needed rejig for the franchise and eventually saved the franchise.",sauravjoshi85,"Sep 9, 2021"

From this movie you get to understand that family isn't only built upon blood but even bonds can make up family, outside bonds.

It was exciting, hilarious, disgusting, crazy, and did I mention exciting already. It was like Ocean's Eleven skill with Transformers 2 Action.Character Development greatly exceeded the previous 4, Background Stories, Cinematography in Brazil never disappointed, Dialogue was clever, Special Effects, Stunts and Fight Scenes, Gunplay, Plot Twists.....Out of ControlWell done and I can't imagine how it could have been any better.",tdedmondjr,"Apr 30, 2011"

8,Undeniably awesome.,"I dare anyone to name the 4th sequel of a franchise (not based on previously known material) that is actually considered a decent movie on it's own? That's right, if there are any, I doubt it's more than a handful.But to call this a decent movie is a gross understatement. If looked at for pure entertainment value, this is probably one of the best action movies I have seen in the last 5 years. You can call the whole thing over-the-top, I don't care, to be honest, that would also be an understatement.The thing is, every movie, even bad ones have a redeeming factor to them. Either it's a certain actor's performance, a unique story or brisk visuals. With this franchise it's always been about cars, babes and action. And it handles the action so exceedingly well this time around that you forget the cheesy moments, you forget you're at the movies, it's like you're right in the middle of it, from the very start.No doubt the cars are beautiful, the girls are gorgeous and the acting is exactly what you would expect. But the story actually has a subplot which gives the movie more emotional depth. Money and freedom is the motivator for these guys, but by doing what they do best they aren't just fighting for their own freedom. This is touched upon a couple of times and it gives the story a good moral boost.And if there isn't something being completely demolished on the big screen it's the trash-talking that keeps the pace at a high level. Laughter guaranteed.I can't recommend this movie enough for action junkies or people who just want to have a good time at the cinema. So if this hasn't been enough...Picture Ocean's Eleven, now think cars, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and a lot of eye-popping violence.Yeah that should do it.",Kungloa,"May 8, 2011"
8,Fast Five - It will NOT disappoint ANYONE!! not even the critics!,"Just returned from the weekend show and; without having watched 3 of the sequels of this famous franchise and only going because of a strong marketing and promotion basically, I have to say Boy!! I was overjoyed after watching this start-to-finish thrill-ride and adrenaline rush offering!! It was not the kind of action-packed race flick where several pieces of disjoint stories are juxtaposed together to basically justify and depict the action and thrill itself, or in other words a messy story, but I had the genuine feeling that the story was well-knit and well-aligned with the amazing action and it had some substance which probably was lacking in previous movies. Especially now as we basically see law-breakers Vs law-enforcers and the boundaries are distinct and somewhat clearly defined, so almost the whole movie gave a feeling of Jason Bourne thrill, so one can imagine that here the story isn't compromised as one would expect before watching the movie----In the end, basically a very very good and thrilling cinematic experience and a valuable addition to the franchise itself. Even if you are like me, I mean, not a fan of racing flicks, this one would certainly force you to change your perspective quite a bit I can guarantee. Thanks!",observer85,"Apr 29, 2011"

Paul Walker and Vin Diesel return to do another job this time on the run from the FBI(led by Dwayne Johnson as DSS agent Hobbs) and the Rio De Janeiro mafia. To pull off the ""one last job"" they assemble a team of professionals(all from previous films) including Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto,Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pearce, Ludicrous as Tej Parker,Sung Kang as Han Lue, and Matt Schulze as Vince. The movie is supposed to be filled with plenty of action involving cars, explosion, and woman, but can the all-star cast of actors make this an entertaining action movie or should the Fast and Furious series ended 2 sequels ago?Check out the rest on my film blog http://mastersfilmreview.wordpress.com/2011/05/02/fast-five-review/",bigcalkenobi,"May 7, 2011"

2,"A loud, dumb movie","Please please stop making these Fast and Furious movies. I'll have to start by explaining that I think auto racing is an obscenity. Why? Because it's a flagrant waste of fossil fuels for no reason except to watch big shiny loud things zooming around. So, a movie about cars racing around and smashing up in totally pointless ways ought to be a double obscenity.But I digress -- the only reason I rate this as high as 2/10 is that at least it's technically competent. It's just loud and dumb. There are some made-up bad guys and some made-up plot, but these are pretty much just a paper-thin veneer to find 'reasons' for our group of (anti)heros to race around, hide, fight, smash up lots of stuff, and generally just keep your eyes busy for 2 hours that you end up wishing you had back. Worst of all is that at the end, it's all excused with some superficial platitudes about 'family'.If all you want for the price of admission is to check your brains at the door and watch meaningless high-priced stunts with no logical connecting tissue, I guess this will fill the bill.",gcsman,"Sep 21, 2017"

I would not mention what happens over here, but, for the people who haven't watched the movie as yet, DO NOT miss the part after the end credits. It was a jaw-dropping moment. It is totally WORTH the wait. I can watch Fast Five over and over again. It was brilliantly produced, directed and shot. Hats off to all the actors in the film. The best part being, all of them re-united from all the sequels. Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson, are two superb and outstanding actors. Paul Walker is just oh-so-hot, always will be. Jordana Brewster's performance in the film is impeccable. Can't wait for the next sequel. Gal Gadot looked very, very pretty in the movie. She is a fantastic actress.

5,Heading Down to Rio de Janeiro,"This film takes up where its predecessor (""Fast & Furious"") left off with ""Dominic Toretto"" (Vin Diesel) being hauled away in a bus on his way to prison. However, before Dominic can be transported to his destination his sister, ""Mia Toretto"" (Jordana Brewster) and the former undercover agent named ""Brian O'Connor"" (Paul Walker) intercept the bus and rescue him. Knowing that they cannot remain in the United States any longer the three of them head down to Rio de Janeiro and resume their usual operations there. Not long after arriving they team up with an extremely corrupt politician named ""Reyes"" (Joaquim de Almeida) who then attempts to double-cross them. Fortunately, Dominic is prepared for this and skillfully manages to turn the tables on Reyes by escaping in a special car which has a valuable computer chip that details Reyes' entire operation. Needless to say, Reyes wants that chip back at all costs and immediately sends his men to capture Dominic and his crew so that he can interrogate and subsequently kill them once he has it. What nobody realizes is that a special agent has been sent from the United States named ""Luke Hobbs"" (Dwayne Johnson) who also has orders to capture Dominic and Brian as well. To that end, neither Reyes nor Luke Hobbs are easily deterred. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that--while this was definitely an entertaining action film--it suffered from one major flaw in that it had too many high-speed stunts which were simply too ridiculous and improbable to be believed. It was just too much. Be that as it may, I liked the addition of Dwayne Johnson who definitely added something extra to the film. Likewise, having three attractive actresses like Gal Gadot (as ""Gisele""), Elsa Pataky (""Elena"") and the aforementioned Jordana Brewster certainly didn't hurt either. That being said, even though this movie would have been much better if the director (Justin Lin) hadn't gotten so carried away with everything, it was still an okay sequel and I have rated it accordingly.

5,If Only they Shutup and Blow Something Up,Fast Five has been getting great reviews and is the first positive received film in the series. It's still another mediocre entry.I must admit that I have not seen all the The Fast and Furious films and I don't really care if I ever do. I decided to see this one and there be it. The movie begins show us Dom (Vin Diesel) is being sentenced to a long time in jail. We later see Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster helping him get free. Then they are on the run and they decide to get a job that the pay is real good. After doing the dangerous job they found out a very important dangerous man is behind the scenes. Then they call the whole crew back to do a big final score. Numerous actors from the series comes in and they show the process of them preparing for the score. At the same time a task force is sent to get Dom and his crew. Which is The Rock's character plays we get to see scenes of that.Let me get it out of the way the film's action sequences are made very well and they do provide the thrills for a movie like this. You can also see the movie drops the glorification of street racing even if it is dangerous. The problem with the film is it's pace and it's heavy nonsense dialogue. It was nothing interesting to say and I didn't really care much about it either. There was comic relief and trust me hot girls and sick ass cars. What bogs the film down is the pace and the dialogue. I do admit the last 30 mins of the film was truly exciting and fun if only the movie was like that the entire time.Sorry wasn't very convincing.MP **/* 2.5/5,migperez,"May 15, 2011"
3,Not up the Expectations,"I must say ""disappointed"".Never was like any of the previous F&F movie. Too much drama made this film look like an average, over budgeted, nonsense action, lot of unwanted CGI and load of crap. It is so ridiculous with such a huge vault is being dragged own by two cars and able to bring down buildings, cars everything on its way and without any single twist to the ropes from two cars.Script is so bad, characters lack the depth, there is no proper story at all. Many actors did not have proper role to play example Elsa Pataki, Sung kang, Gal Gadot and Tyrese . One or two action scenes were good, but saw those in the trailer.Moral of the story : I want my money back !!",suuniil,"May 2, 2011"

This is the 5th instalment of a franchise where you know what to expect - a lot of car action as well as plenty of gun-toting, foot chasing and one-on-one brawling; on which it delivers, overwhelmingly so, to the point that your head will be spinning by the end of it all.",slavewire,"Sep 25, 2011"
No rating,Family First,"Vin Diesel plays Dom Toretto in ""The Fast and The Furious"". Dom, a fugitive ex-con, hiding with his girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) who is forced to leave his girlfriend and crew behind to avoid the police catching them all. This results in a serious of high profile crimes and Dom returns to Los Angeles (LA) seeking answers. Once back in LA Dom is thrown back with Paul Walkers character (Agent Brian O'Conner). The two do not see eye and are often verbally battling. However as Agent O'Conner and Dom are each investigating the crimes their paths continue to cross and soon it is obvious that Fenix (Laz Alonzo) is behind the crimes. Fenix works for a drug dealer named Arturo Braga (John Ortiz). Each of the men wants Braga for his own personal reasons. The film takes the viewer on exciting car chases through the Mexican desert, underground tunnels, and through the streets of LA. Each of these scenes is made more realistic by the camera angles. One such scene appears as the drug running team is racing across the Mexican desert towards mountains. At first, it looks as if the cars might smash into the side of the mountain but at the last minute, the camera angle exposes an opening. The theme of this film may seem hard to locate under all the action but it is an old-fashioned one. Nothing is more important than family and good friends are. Families come in many forms some of directly related and others are chosen. The police to the ending of the film demonstrate this throughout the film from the first time Dom leaves his girlfriend and crew in hopes of avoiding their capture. Dialogue is the main factor used to demonstrate the theme. A good example of this towards the end of the film Brian is seriously hurt and even though the police are coming Dom stays behind to make sure Brian is safe by saying ""he's tired of running"". The theme is again repeated at the end of the film when Brian returns the favor however to describe the scene or dialogue would ruin the end of this fast paced film. Although many viewers will only see the fast cars, action packed scenes, and violence the underlying fact of the film is families are the most important things.",jemai02,"Sep 16, 2011"
No rating,Mindless fun,"What can someone expect from the 5th ""sequel"", after not watching first four? Probably something bad, milked to the bone and totally dry. Well, this is not the case here. I'll probably watch all the ""prequels"" backwards, just for a different perspective. This movie is fun and a huge slaughterhouse for the automobiles. Reminds me of The Wild Bunch only because of the ""body count"", only here ""poor"" cars prevail in the pile. The movie is very watchable, dynamic, action packed and (despite many obvious flaws in the plot) just OK. In these type of films directing and editing (beside special effects) is what counts and that part of the job is well done. The only time when I actually mentioned someone ""acting"" is when Dwayne Johnson pops up. That man, bearing his muscles as more of a curse in life than a blessing, is highly underestimated as an actor (watch Faster and you'll see what I mean). Others just pass through the scenes not even trying to do anything but to have fun themselves. If you have approx. 130 minutes surplus for some passive entertainment, go and watch this one. Don't expect. Just enjoy the ride.",Maleplatypus,"Aug 26, 2011"
No rating,Ocean's 11 meets F&F,"Overall, this film is another entertaining chapter in the F&F franchise. I enjoyed it, but less than than its immediate predecessor. Where this movie falls short for me is in the ensemble cast aspect. It seems like the production company tried to stretch this episode against the canvas of an ""Ocean's 11"" type story (big cast, ""switcheroo"" plot), and as a result only a couple of the peripheral characters get to stand out and actually mean something to the story or the audience. Most noticeably, Elsa Pataky (as Officer Elena Neves) and Gal Gadot (returning as Gisele Harabo from Fast & Furious) assume roles on opposite sides of the law - but any roundness that could be lent to their characters seems lost in a cast that is way too large. The two actresses are similar enough in appearance that, as a result, I had to really struggle to find context to know which character was on screen at any given time. Dwayne Johnson steps in and provides a ""larger than life"" tough guy whose character is somewhat predictable. Via teaser information revealed in a scene at the end of the credits, the story ends up serving to largely be an intricate set up for the next movie. I guess it depends on the story line and how they plan to accommodate the passage of time, but it seems that they would be best served by completing this next chapter sooner rather than later - everyone is getting older and as the youthful element drains from the production, the concept starts to look even sillier than it started out to be.",dst-thomas,"Nov 3, 2011"
No rating,Does what it sets out to do,"The original ""The Fast and Furious"" was exactly that, fast furious, silly and laser focused on it's young male target market.The law of diminishing quality applied to the sequels, if not box office but this fifth installment has well and truly bucked the trend. This latest offering reuniting many of the original cast but also dragging in the ""The Rock"" to really drive home the message, this is a more substantial film.We still get the obligatory coupe of scenes with flash cars, models with painted on outfits and the whole project exudes testosterone from every pore. There is however more heart here, it does mean something, not much but there is a heist story in there holding the whole premise together.Paul Walker and Van Diesel reprise their roles, clearly finding work outside the franchise not as lucrative or productive as they had hoped. There is a lot of gunplay and the body count is high but in keeping with the certificate, everyone dies very cleanly with little gore on display, an A-Team for the new generation.This time we are firmly based in South America, Rio Janeiro amongst the Fave-la's, read very poor areas, where filming must have been difficult with the crowds that must have accumulated. We have lots of running over roofs, jumps and great helicopter shots, that would presumably would have been impossible in a more risk averse and libelous urban setting.Following a spectacular ""break out"", which in reality no-one would have survived, we start with Brian O'Conner (Walker) and girlfriend Mia Toretta (Jordana Brewster) at a low ebb. They are in Rio on the run, visiting their old friend Vince (Matt Schulze), for a bit of a feed and the possibility of another job, as funds are definitely low.The job on offer involves boosting high end cars from a moving train, an action sequence which is very impressive, in a ""looks like somebody is actually doing most of this"", kind of way. It is preposterous of course but if you want real life drama and social commentary, anything with Fast and Furious in the title will not be high on your list.The rather dubious moral aspects of stealing stuff and getting rich quick are certainly not explored, nobody has a real job and as always, driving cars really fast in dangerous situations, is always completely safe and fun.Once the cars are obtained with Dominic Toretta's help (Diesel), the old gang is assembled as they realize they have stumbled onto something bigger, involving the obligatory king drug lord Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). We know he is an overlord as he kills an underling in off hand manner, sometimes it would be good to see a drug lord forgive a minion for a minor infraction, at least it would be something new.The gang come to the attention of the elite US Diplomatic Security Service (USS) backed squad led by Luke Hobbs (The Rock, Dwayne Johnson). This group act as police, judge and jury, seemingly wasting bad guys at will with apparent impunity. They are aided by the very pretty but initially mousey widow (Elsa Pataky) of the only apparently honest policeman in Rio.The assembled gang get little to do, apart from add legitimacy to the reinvented franchise, although Tyrese Gibson gets some good lines and comedy is ably provided by Tego and Don.The closing sequence is probably at 13 on a scale of 10 for believability but certainly will have stimulated the South American car industry with the number of cars destroyed.Diesel and the Rock dispense with any pretense of acting and just bulge muscles, fight at length and look macho, occasionally all at the same time. There are some unintentional laugh out loud moments but Paul Walker does slip in a few quiet moments of real acting when the crew and director were off planning the next stunt.Summary Does what it sets out to do but at least with a little more style and substance than the last three entries.Will not be troubling Oscar but with top notch ""real"" stunts and a stronger plot, this shows the franchise may have more in the tank yet for those who like their action Fast, Furious and a bit daft.",julian-mumford,"Oct 21, 2011"
No rating,I love this effing movie!,"It was loud. It was fast. Cars raced and crashed. They shot people. People fell in love.Every man in this movie is so sexy I could hardly breathe. Don't worry fellas, there's lot of eye candy for you too.Plot? What plot. There's kind of a plot but who gives a damn. Let's be loud, fast, race cars, crash them and ratchet up the tension with an impossible heist for tons of money involving murderous drug dealers (Long live Bucho! still got mad swag after all these years) and corrupt cops.It even had an ""after the credits twist"" that left my eyes stinging with surprised tears.I love this movie!",cristalshandalear,"Oct 9, 2011"

No rating,Camaraderie,"The title for this ongoing sequel to Fast and Furious is, it seems, related to the number of films based on this fast driving bunch of car fanatics than to the number of people in the tribe. What makes this series of Pow and Wow action flicks stand above many of its competitors is the tremendous sense of fun the cast seems to be having - leaping over rooftops, driving fast cars, pulling off impossible heists. It all ends in a sense of fun and introduces the teaser for the next in the series (a bit with Eva Mendes and Jason Mignot in a brief talk after the credits run pretty much guarantees the next installment).This time the guys and girls - Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel), his sister Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster), her boyfriend ex-cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), Vince (Matt Schulze), Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson), Tej Parker (Ludacris), Han Lue (Sung Kang), Gisele Harabo (Gal Gadot) Tego Leo (Tego Calderon), and Rico Santos (Don Omar) - gather in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - each in various stages of running from the past - hunted by FBI Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and in desperate need for money to escape Rio to countries where they cannot be extradited. They discover the one last job opportunity - taking away the money that billionaire Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) takes from the money houses in the infamous Rio favelas district. It takes the talent of the entire crew to make the heist of heists as the safe where the illegal money is kept is in the police station in a huge vault that is impenetrable - until our gang takes over in likely the most interesting and entertaining chase scene on film. The rest of the story is fluff but nice - with a little love interest thrown in for good measure. This cast is strong and they pull of the fine line between comedy and drama very well. In the end this is a fast and entertaining escape film. And #6 will probably come soon! Grady Harp",gradyharp,"Oct 6, 2011"

No rating,Popcorn Fun,"I went with a certain amount of trepidation, but I came out of this movie impressed with action. Sure, the plot is below average and the dialogue is laughable but I really didn't expect either to be good. The refreshing thing is that there is real dialogue, forced but real and they punched up the fun all the way through. Bottom line - see this because it is a fun action movie with enough cars and fun to make the popcorn go down easy. It may not keep you on the edge of your seat but it doesn't have to for the most part.If you see this with the kind of low expectations that I had (heck, even if you're greatly anticipating this thing), I'm willing to bet (since I bet on everything) that you'll enjoy it.",krieg8814254,"Jun 13, 2011"
No rating,Great and Amazing film......,"Fast&Furious 5 was one of the greatest films of the series:hands down. We are as the audience of the film enticed completely to the screen. Action completely start to finish.And the fact that the producers decided to make the film around eventually, robbing a bank was immense. Great action. I also, think that the fighting scene between Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson was amazing, I think that they are such great rivals. However, we learn that they start to work as a team in Fast and the Furious 6 which will hopefully still involve violence between the two characters on who has more power or something and who makes the decisions. Finally, Great cars used in the Film as always Nice American muscle cars e.g. Dodge Charger to great Tuners like Nissan GTR at the end. Keep up the great films!",JoeAshleyGough,"Feb 11, 2013"
No rating,More than just a car chase plus the Rock helps,There is more story here than in the previous instalments. Combine that with an exotic setting in Rio and a stunning car chase climax it's well worth watching. Not just about car chases anymore. There is a daring break in. The Rock provides quite a good addition. His scenes with Vin Diesel is quite memorable. Couple of minus points: the way they portrayed parts of Rio as a gun infested slum must not be the image Rio is hoping to promote for the 2016. There could have been more attractive settings. Bit too sexist use of the ladies too. Overall enjoyable and a bit more far ranging than the last few.,phd_travel,"Nov 6, 2011"
No rating,Transporting action,"This may be the most dependable entry so far. The story and many of the stunts are of course unrealistic in the extreme, like the FBI SWAT team rolling around Rio shooting gangsters or the American cop who teams up with our guy to take down the local drug-lord. It's a knucklehead story with no larger world of diplomatic relations, and just goes a long way to display everything that is obnoxious about how Americans see themselves in the world. The narrative style adopted in this entry is the heist film, whose chief goal of course is to hoodwink the viewer.So I can buy the big switcheroo at the end, because the action is transporting, it has energy that carries me into the thing, some times it's enough when a film can do that. The train hijack at the beginning has amazing dynamism, it goes a long way when real stuff break and shoot in the air and it's not just models on a computer screen, admirable stuntwork. Action films need this gravity to work.Another gravity it affects, weirdly, is that many characters from previous films assemble for the big con. They're not charmers like in the Ocean films, they wouldn't be in reality. But knowing them, and spending some simple time with them as the film wisely does, places this higher than all previous ones. The story is fast and simple, it's long but the mechanics are so finely oiled it zips by.I also take from it those evocative and sweeping aerial shots of Rio, such a beautiful city. I could watch those for two hours and really wished for a more abstract look at place like we'd have in a Michael Mann film. This is a recurrent complaint from me for these films by the way. All in all, I'm just a different guy to what the franchise has to offer, especially the thuggish wrap. But I take a few things from each film, which is more than I expect to get from the new Superman movie.",chaos-rampant,"Jul 12, 2013"

No rating,"Easily the best of the series and very fun and exciting to watch. Not many car racing scenes, which I liked. I say B+","""The guys we're after are professional runners. They like speed and are guaranteed to go down the hardest possible way so make sure you've got your funderwear on. We find 'em we take 'em as a team and we bring 'em back. And above all else we don't ever, ever let them get into cars."" After breaking Dominic (Diesel) out of the jail bus Brian and him move to Rio to start a new life of robbing and stealing. After Brian gets news that makes him want to stop running the team decides to pull off one last heist. I have never been a real big fan of the series. They are good but have mostly been ""I have car...I go fast."" The fourth one was the best because it actually had a story to it. Then I saw this one. Far and away the best of the series so far. For those that watched them for the racing I should warn you, there is only one scene in this one. This one was more in the style of ""Oceans 11"" then a ""Fast & Furious"" movie. I'm not sure if the sixth one they are making is needed, but like all movies lately they will make them until they make one too many...then the remakes start. That reason aside this is a very fun and exciting heist movie very much worth watching. Overall, I surprisingly liked it a lot and highly recommend this. I give this a B+.Would I watch it again? - I think I would, I can't say that about the other four.*Also try - Fast & Furious 1-4 & Takers",cosmo_tiger,"Oct 3, 2011"
No rating,"This is a fun, mindless action movie. If you enjoy this, you must see this!","This is a damn good action movie. You don't need to see all the other movies prior to seeing this, only the first one and the fourth one.It starts immediately after the last one ended. Dom played by Vin Diesel, Brian played by Paul Walker and Mia played by Jordana Brewster are hiding in Brazil, they do a job and they are being chased by a federal agent named Luke Hobbs played by Dwayne Johnson and a drug lord named Hernan Reyes played by Joaquim de Almedia. The plot is thin but it's still interesting, there is little more than planning for the next job or phase and a thin plot is better than no plot. No plot would just be running and gunning, talking and resting and maybe having sex once.The action is great, loud and mindless, if you only like realistic action movies, avoid this. Unlike the other movies, this isn't a racing movie, this is a heist movie with racing in it, similar to The Italian Job, I only seen the remake which was okay I guess. Some people hate the fact that the series has taken a new direction and it's understandable but I think taking new directions is a great way, probably the best way to make a series entertaining a while longer instead of allowing it to become boring. Slasher movies are the opposite of taking a new direction, still a slasher movie could be universally hated if aliens suddenly show up and the killer helps his victims kill the aliens.Why didn't I give this movie a perfect score? The plot is thin, there isn't much character development, Joaquim's character is bland, the acting is mediocre, and maybe the serious dialogue is bad, I haven't noticed any bad dialogue before seeing it but it may happen the next time I see it. Speaking of acting, Vin Diesel shows a little more emotion than usual and although Dwayne hasn't done that too, he still is entertaining and he's probably the best actor or performer in the movie. There is a short, surprising scene halfway through the credits, you really should see it.I had a lot of fun with this, it's too bad I seen it alone. The DVD is coming out on October 5, six months after it came out and I'm not sure if I'll get the DVD alone or the DVD/Blu Ray combo pack. I'm looking forward to Fast Six which comes out on May 2013 and hopefully that will be the last, six movies is enough.",ty-jensen,"Aug 26, 2011"
No rating,"Wow!!!! So much better than the other films, justin lin really stepped it up a notch","It's been 10 years since The Fast and the Furious power-slid into theaters trailed by mixed reviews but an overwhelmingly positive reaction from fans. Future installments, especially 2 Fast 2 Furious​ and Tokyo Drift​, were panned by critics but (in spite of mostly nonsensical plots and sub-par acting) the films continued to bring in big bucks for Universal -- delivering the same over-the-top action sequences grounded in illegal street-racing culture that fans had come to expect. Now, director Justin Lin is once again stepping behind the wheel of another Fast and Furious film (side note: he directed Tokyo Drift as well as Fast & Furious) with Fast Five. The film not only stars the fan-favorite pairing of Dominic Toretto​ (Vin Diesel​) and Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker​), but also brings back a number of familiar faces from prior installments – as well as introducing hell-hath-no-fury DSS agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) into the mix. However, saddled with so many personalities in one film, does Fast Five still deliver high-octane action and an engaging story? Fans of prior installments will be pleased to hear that Fast Five is probably the biggest and most over-the-top film in The Fast and Furious franchise. It's not likely to win over many audience members who didn't see any of the earlier films but, for anyone who likes muscle cars, beautiful women, and heist films, Fast Five delivers plenty of pulse-pounding moments.",funkymihir,"Aug 23, 2011"
