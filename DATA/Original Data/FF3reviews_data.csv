7,The last one about actual racing?,"Look behind the woeful accent and this is actually a good movie. The first F&F was about racing, then went all Miami Vice. A final return to the street racing scene had to move away from the original cast as they had lost their 'From the streets' appeal.Anyway back to this, some sweet cars that aren't the massively expensive hyper cars of later episodes and some trick driving to boot.A quality film if you manage to watch it a couple of times and don't dwell on the accent.",sarnieken,"Mar 28, 2021"
7,For the most part a good car action flick.,"The first film was BREAK POINT with cars. The second one was Miami VICE with cars. This is REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE... with more cars. To be honest, I kinda liked this one better than the last two, despite Lucas Black somehow beating Paul Walker as the least charismatic actor in a starring role. What I mainly like is the direction by Justin Lin. The focus on police undercover stories is dropped in favor of the street racing culture and its connections to the mob. Was actually delighted to see Sonny Chiba appear, I must have missed his name during the opening credits. Purely as a movie about car action, I think it succeeds better than the first two. There's a goofy quality to it that kinda helps one go along with things. Best to sum that up is Lucas Black smiling like a dork with blood on his teeth, living for the thrill. That's probably what this film series needed, and less soap opera/undercover drama. Consider me surprised.",tmm_8705,"Jun 28, 2013"

6,"The drivers, the cars and the Drift races are the real stars of this movie , well directed on Tokyo location","This is an exciting narration of drifting auto racing with exceptionally fine camera work and great car chase sequences and crashes on the metropolitan streets. It deals about a rebel American adolescent named Shawn Boswell(Lucas Black as a determined race-car driver) challenges his contender for a race cars, causing wreak havoc racing 195 mph through streets. To avoid the jail, his mother(Lynda Boyd) sends him Tokyo where is his father(Brian Goodman) as US military. Meanwhile the newcomer Shawn tries to ingratiate with Twinkie(Nathalie Kelley) and the world of racing in Japan, and hoping to join his extended group. In Tokio he discovers the underworld of the Yazuka and competes against Drift kingpin who is niece of mobster chief(Sonny Chiba who does a credible job).The picture mingles action-packed,drama, exciting pursuits cars, suspense, a little bit of violence and spectacular sequences though won't mean much on little screen TV. Flashy, noisy race-cars set in the Japan by the producers, -the famous Neal Moritz-of first part. Pulse-quickening action but plenty of clichés and lots of dirty driving and heavier on crashes than coherency. All stunts were performed by authentic experts without people damage. Special cameo by Vin Diesel and appearance by Sonny Chiba, a Kung Fu idol of the 70s. Justin Lin's direction(previously made Annapolis and Better Luck tomorrow) is competent though the story eventually run out of gas. Justin Lin is directing the third part with Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster. The movie gives new meaning to the term ¨Tuning¨and ¨Drifting¨. The flick will like to adrenaline lovers and those young people looking for strong emotions. This is the kind of film in which the cars enthusiastic will enjoy immensely, it's a must see for cars fonds.",ma-cortes,"Apr 8, 2008"
7,"Decent, Hardly any substance, But Sometime to watch :D","What can I say about this movie that many haven't already noted? Well first of all I saw this movie twice, and probably shouldn't have. The cinematography was phenomenal and the racing sequences were jaw dropping. Unfortunately, this movie lacks substance. The storyline was really iffy and probably not likely to happen and the acting was a little shaky.But thats not the reason why everyone goes to watch this movie. We all go to see the cars and the girls which fortunately delivers. Beautiful cars, beautiful ladies and beautiful scenery and destructive driving is never in short supply in this genre and the scenery of Japan is just breathtaking. All in all, just a movie you'll want to see with the boys.",andykhiem87,"Aug 1, 2006"
7,"""One car in exchange for knowing what a man's made of? That's a price I can live with.""","FILM: 7.0
Rewatching the 2006 film The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, I find myself enjoying it more than most people seem to. So, here's an unpopular opinion: Tokyo Drift ties as my third favourite film in the series. The film ramps up the fun straight away, ditches the cheese of the second instalment, and goes for an original plot.One of the aspects I appreciate most about Tokyo Drift is its unique setting and storyline. Shifting the focus to Tokyo and introducing the world of drift racing feels fresh and exciting. The races and chases are some of the series' best, with a kinetic energy that keeps me engaged throughout. The soundtrack is another highlight, with its thumping beats perfectly complementing the high-speed action.I know people heap crap on it for not keeping it in the ""family,"" but it's an undeniably fun ride. The absence of the core characters initially feels strange, but the new cast manages to hold their own. Lucas Black as Sean Boswell brings a different kind of protagonist to the table, and I find his journey from outsider to drift racing aficionado quite compelling.The character of Han, played by Sung Kang, is a standout. His cool, mentor-like presence adds depth to the film and makes for some memorable moments. The Tokyo setting is visually stunning, and the film makes excellent use of its locations, showcasing the vibrant cityscape in a way that's both thrilling and immersive.What I like about Tokyo Drift is its ability to balance the adrenaline-pumping action with a story that feels grounded. The film doesn't rely on the over-the-top stunts that the later entries in the series do, and that simpler approach works in its favour.Overall, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a fairly positive experience that brings something fresh and exciting to the franchise. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, I find it to be a fun and engaging film that stands out in its own right.FORMAT: Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.0

5,The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is far better than I expected - but I had low expectations. Enjoyable but not critically appealing,"I was quite surprised by The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift. Of course, I expected it to be a pile of steaming garbage, particularly with the formula of increasingly dodgy sequels. So when I went to see it with some friends, I had obvious misgivings. These misgivings, or at least the worst ones, such as the movie being unbearable to even look at, were fortunately unfounded. I kept my eyes on the movie the whole time, mainly because of the souped cars, but the fact that I went through the movie without flinching (a lot, except at some of the bad dialogue that was prevalent), says quite a lot. Maybe my view of The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift is heightened by the fact that I cracked a few jokes during the movie.Now down to business. Sean, a 'dude' who loves to race at high speeds for no apparent reason, is sent to Tokyo to live with his military dad and ends up being drawn to the racing circuit again, witnessing a new style of race called 'drift' (as seen in Need For Speed Underground, to those that don't know). Sounds stupid? Well, it is, the casual viewer can detect a plothole or two from even reading those two lines. To go on, except to state that Sean ends up making friends with a guy named Han, is pointless. I will admit that no-one looks for a good plot in a Fast and the Furious movie, but still, the less said, the better.The dialogue, as I stated, can be funny - because of its stupidity. This is shown by one piece of dialogue where some guy asks Sean: ""You know what DK stands for?"" and Sean replies ""Donkey Kong"". At least its original, I guess.The acting is OK - far from turgid, which I expected it to be in the first place. The guy who plays Han is surprisingly good, going through the movie without looking as if he was hired from a nearby sushi bar. Brian Tee as DK is a bit of a joke, he is more comedic than menacing. Lucas Black is OK as Sean, but his Southern accent makes his character more irritating to watch. The love interest does well as eye candy. That's about all that matters I guess.The most important part of The Fast and the Furious is inarguably the racing sequences and their overall effectiveness. I will admit that the sequences themselves are well-filmed and eye catching, highlighting the cars, as they should. However, except in a few fleeting moments, they are not as enthralling as they should be and this is one of the most disappointing aspects of The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift. The final confrontation, for me, is pretty good to watch, but only arouses the senses once in a while.Time didn't drag though, which is a clear sign that The Fast and Furious is indeed quite watchable, despite its other pre-eminent faults. I admit that I didn't really get bored during the film, which may lead to my rose-tinted view of it (compared to my original perception of what it would be like).So let me summarise my thoughts: ""Didn't expect much, got more than I bargained for."" The acting is satisfactory (for a racing film, otherwise it would more or less suck), the plot and the dialogue are predictably terrible, the racing sequences are satisfactory and the cinematography is somewhat effective, with frequent close-ups of the cars. What compels me to give The Fast and The Furious a pass grade is the fact that it is, like I said, quite watchable. However, it is still little more than satisfactory, so it's rating cannot therefore rise above:2.5/5 stars",DaRick89,"Jun 21, 2006"

6,A slight departure for the franchise.,"When teenage road-racer Sean Boswell (Lucas Black, who is too old for the part, but hey-ho) gets in trouble with the law for a third time, he avoids a jail sentence by going to live with his father in Tokyo; there, he becomes involved in the drift racing scene, coming to blows with DK (Brian Tee), the nephew of a powerful Yakuza.Tokyo Drift gets short shrift from some Fast & Furious fans because it steers the franchise away from the US street racing scene and because it doesn't star series regular Paul Walker. While it might be a slight step down from the previous entries, being a little too teen-centric with its predictably troublesome high school protagonist, I don't think it's all that bad. As a fan of all things Japanese, I can appreciate the colourful Tokyo setting, the Yakuza storyline, and, of course, all those oriental cuties in extremely short skirts.Director Justin Lin, who went on to helm parts 4, 5 and 6 in the series, handles the car scenes with aplomb, each race shifting up a gear in terms of adrenaline-pumping action. Drifting—sliding the car around sharp corners at high speed—adds a new level of excitement to the action, with a mountain road finale offering plenty of nerve jangling, edge-of-the-seat moments. The film closes with the reappearance of a familiar face, paving the way for further instalments.",BA_Harrison,"Dec 20, 2015"
2,laughably stupid threadbare plot,"An incurable addicted-to-speed young racer, Lucas Black, escapes to Tokyo to avoid jail after repeated arrests for racing. He joins his father, (who is estranged from his mother), in Tokyo where he runs into problems with other local race-aholics. The young American vies for the attention of gal who is linked to local Japanese racer, and the two rivals for affection eventually butt heads. This is the extent of plot you get in this tire-screeching, attitude and hormone churning, low-brow flick, where almost every character seems to be suffering from some form of personality disorder, or is just plain stupid. Somehow, in spite of a glaring lack of insight or smarts, the protagonist, a refugee from high school ""shop"" classes where he learned to work on cars, seems to master the Japanese language effortlessly. The Japanese characters in the flick are equally repulsive, or more so, as most are no more than thugs, with our hero's Japanese rival wrapped up in a Yakuza (Mafia) family. The movie is just a ""loser to bruiser"" story, as the young American masters the Japanese racing style, with flashy fast cars providing the backdrop for our hero's transformation. The movie does offer a generous supply of laughs, but I don't think that's what the director and company had intended.",dmuel,"Sep 5, 2006"

7,"Action packed testosterone, cars and chicks. But don't try this at home. :)","I expected no less and no more than what I got: Vin Diesel, fully using his newly acquired love for Shakespearian acting, gives us a performance of style and finesse. Too bad that's only in the last minute of the movie.In the rest of the movie, hot head teenagers race for no other reason than adrenaline overdose, using top class Japanese cars in Tokyo. The story is pretty weak, too, but if there are people that get turned on by cars, this is a porn movie, and they don't really need a story.For a movie placed in Tokyo there was a suspiciously low number of Japanese actors with actual lines. The cute Asian chicks appeared only in a few scenes, then ""drifted"" away. Lucas Black, with the same accent he has 10 years ago when he played an annoying kid in American Gothic, has now a big pack of extra muscles and a winning smile.Conclusion: fast paced car movie, nothing else, really. A few free Japanese lessons now and then and a very peaceful representation of the Yakuza. And the disclaimer in the end felt so funny when my heart was beating faster against my will from the speed racing and it said ""everything was done in a controlled environment, don't try this... blah blah blah"".",siderite,"Jul 10, 2006"

7,Gotta love the drift!,"Judging by the majority of the comments I'd better explain myself and why I like this movie. Sure the acting isn't that great and the storyline is a little hard to follow and hard to believe but tricked out rides are the stars in the franchise of the Fast and the Furious. The first one had the nation going crazy because it showed everyone the world of street racing. This is why I can appreciate Tokyo Drift because despite the acting and the iffy storyline it introduces another element of street racing, drifting. Before this movie if you mentioned drifting to the average person they wouldn't know what you were talking about. So I like the movie because it concentrates on the racing theme which is why people went to see it. I know it's a movie so there has to be a storyline but sometimes it ""drifts"" away from racing too long...sorry couldn't resist the pun. As for the totally new cast, it didn't bother me because as I've said the cars are the real stars in movies like this, it doesn't matter who drives as we've seen in the previous two films. It gets a 7 for the awesome racing scenes in Tokyo, they keep you interested enough to sit through the blah blah blah that is everything else in the movie.",coolnes20,"Nov 2, 2006"

8,Really good film.,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is the least popular of the Fast and Furious franchise but it's also the most underrated. While I thought the country accent was a little overblown and some of the cgi looked a little too obvious, the movie was really good. The plot is fresh and exciting, the acting is spot on, and the cars are great. That's honestly one of my only gripes with 2 Fast 2 Furious is that, while really entertaining, it got away from the car element quite a bit. This movie brought back the cool car factor that made the first film so special. Overall, while it wasn't as good as the first two, it was still a great movie in its own right and one that can stand alone without the others.",Bruce722,"Jun 5, 2013"
No rating,"Target audience stuff - noisy, full of rootless action, devoid of characters and convincing plotting , it sounds and looks like nothing more than an extended music video","When yet another town sees Sean Boswell getting into trouble with the law, his mother sees no choice but to send him out of the US to live with his father in Tokyo, Japan. However it is not long before Sean gets involved in the illegal racing scene yet again. Taking in by Han, Sean immediately clashes with DJ, the son of Yakuza Kamata over the racing and also the latter's girlfriend Neela.Three films into this franchise and nobody is really even pretending that anyone is here for the characters or plotting subtleties. So instead we have a choppy script that expects us to buy the laziest and nonsensical plot devices yet  witness the way that Sean gets in with Han, it makes little sense but the script doesn't let that bother it as it blunders onwards. What it blunders towards is the thinnest of excuses for lots of car chases, load music, male posturing and sexy girls in skimpy clothes. That the plot is poor is a given and it is probably not worth getting into it because I don't think the makers were aiming for more.It is also perhaps unfair to criticise them for this because they hit their targets with ruthless efficiency. Knowing their target audience the makers deliver the goods when it comes to what male teenagers will be looking for and it does it in noisy spades. There are lot of shiny toys and lots of races full of unlikely moves and screeching tyres. Personally I found them repetitive and lacking the tension and involvement that comes with action built on top of strong characters and stories but if all you want is the gloss then I can see why it would appeal. What I found a little less easy to swallow was the film's treatment of women. At best the women are love interests with a bit of history but the majority of skimpily clad and dancing  quick to flock to the male characters and always ready to give out phone numbers. Lesbians kissing in a corridor are thrown into the mix for no reason other than titillating the male viewers. It is nothing new in this type of film but it is tiresome to see it  is this the message we want to send to teenage boys!? The cast are average to a man. Black is pretty poor and I quickly tired of his accent and his character. He rarely manages to hold the attention when sharing the screen with anyone and is thus not a great leading man  even at this level. Bow Wow is at least fun and he benefits from not really taking it too seriously  in the more serious moments he is weak but that is to be expected. Tee is a solid presence in the baddie role but, with more dialogue to undermine him, Kang is not up to much. Kelley is cute but is not given much more to work with. I thought she did the job but not much more than that. Sonny Chiba buys the movie cult points in a cameo. Lin directs like one big pop video but not a very imaginative one since he revels in the obvious touches of flair and lacks imagination in his delivery; good for what the audience wants but is that all he wanted to achieve?Overall then a film that does what you expect of it, which will either be a good or bad thing dependant on your viewpoint. It is noisy, full of rootless action, devoid of characters and convincing plotting and at times sounds and looks like nothing more than an extended music video  which is just what it is I suppose. Knows its target audience really well (depressingly well) but will have little to offer those outside this limited demographic or seeking more.",bob the moo,"Apr 19, 2007"
6,Ummm....OK I guess,"Going into this movie I had the lowest expectations ever. I mean Bow wow is in it. Couldn't they have gotten some better actors like Vin Diesel or Paul Walker, like in the first two? No, they got Bow Wow. Well I went in with very very low expectations and walked thinking it wasn't too bad. It was an o.k. overdone action movie I'll give it that. The acting was quite cheesy and the movie itself was predictable. But at the same time it did have some very nice(nice, not possible) racing scenes that I did enjoy. Another thing was that I totally didn't feel the fast and the furious ""feeling"" throughout this one, as I did during the first two. It just doesn't quite follow the same theme and guidelines. But its a guaranteed favorite for all those die hard action movie lovin people, jus wasn't all that great with me.",maxgunko,"Jun 19, 2006"

8,"No rats in buckets, no CGI, just an entertaining flick featuring excellent car racing","Branching away from any original cast members of the first two films, thankfully, Tokyo Drift provides a refreshingly new look to the franchise.Tokyo Drift is possibly my favourite of the series, or at least its up there with the first film; it only has a few problems that can be swept under the ""It's Fast and the Furious, what do you expect"" carpet. The story follows American ""teenager"" Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) whose reckless driving lands him prison time, but to avoid this he moves in with his father in Tokyo. He attempts to move on a dangerous rival's girl, and must become a competitor in the street racing's drifting scene.I say ""teenager"" as that's what IMDb says, and he does go to school in the movie but honestly, he's the oldest teen I've ever seen. Along with every other ""teen"" in this movie! While I talk negatives, the majority of the film is set in Tokyo yet 95% of the dialogue is English and Sean has a knack of meeting every foreigner in the city. I don't mind this so much, but I fully expect all of the Japanese characters to speak Japanese, especially when Sean isn't present!But, unlike 2 Fast 2 Furious (choke) this film actually cares for its characters and their personalities (as Sean says early on: ""It's not about the ride, it's about the rider"") from Sean's fish-out-of- water acceptance, to his mentor Han's closet of skeletons. The villain isn't ridiculous either, his uncle is part of the Yakuza and he has a serious ""king of a little hill"" problem. Again unlike 2 Fast 2 Furious (gag) the cars have never looked better, sleek and refined and the drifting action is spectacular, especially when synchronized. Plus, no CGI, just skilled professional drivers, making the film worth seeing solely for the racing.There's no stupid Tyrese Gibson mugging at the camera, no rats in buckets, no CGI, just an entertaining (albeit poorly localized) flick featuring excellent car racing and professional stunts.",CinemaCocoa,"Apr 13, 2017"

It succeeds in being a love letter to the city, but changes the formula for the franchise too much in ways that don't work.An attempt at returning to the Teensploitation type tone, Tokyo Drift feels like a stand-alone film but is actually a monkey wrench in the Fast & Furious timeline. Han is easily the best character and is the only one to join the family in other entries in the series. The other characters are straightforward stereotypes without the cheesy charm of past leads like Diesel and Walker..",mediatation,"Jun 17, 2024"
No rating,Practical,"Summer movies, what a zone to enter! What a collection of thrills, disappointments and adventures of different kinds! Sometimes for me they take me to a sublime place: ""King Kong,"" ""Van Helsing."" Most times its just noise.If its cinematic, I'll credit it with space in my life. Yes, I know the first two F&F were considered dumb, not worthy. Some of that I think is a residual class bias in the US. Muscle cars and racing has always been a trailer park thing. True enough and the stories, all three of them are cluttered with cultural touchstones: dumb, honest, sublegal. And the trailer park notion of girls as prizes.Well, if you are serious about movies, you pretty much ignore the stories. And in summer movies you know the icons transcend their cultural places and move to a grander cinematic place. So a hillbilly isn't a hillbilly, more of a hillbillybillboard. The real appeal is in whether it is cinematic or not. Now this is a tricky issue, and a matter of taste. Tarantino, for example, obnoxiously advertises the cinematic overloading of ""Bill,"" but that's just inventory, right? The Coens seem more genuine and satisfying. But with the Fast and Furious projects, the idea was a nostalgic one, to recall an obsolete cinematic value: the car chase. More, to do it without computer graphics, but with camera angles now common from the CGI era. In movielanguage, this is called doing it ""practically,"" meaning with real cars, mountains, cameras.Computer graphics is still enough artificial that we know the difference. That matrix highway fight or any one of the mission impossible deals might be exciting, but there's an extra edge to knowing that something is real. Like a Buster Keaton or Harold Lloyd stunt. The first F&F simply mined this. I liked it enough to consider my cinematic mind massaged. The second one obviously responded to market research that showed huge ticket sales in Asia. So they retooled the whole thing, both in the story (Asian girls, Asian cars), in the style (neon) and in the film-making itself.A huge hit in Asia. US viewers were almost disposable.Now this third one: actually set in Tokyo though filmed in LA. Its a step down in style: the production design is not nearly as polished and cool, instead it is more industrial, cheaper to do. The F&F production sponsors clearly are settling in for the long haul where they can make one of these every year or so indefinitely. Oddly, the sexy bodies  traditionally the cheapest thing you can get  are played down in this one.Anyway, the real value in this is the camera rush. There's some cool folding at the race at the end where phonecams merge with the cameras we see through. We become the spectators on the side of the road.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",tedg,"Jul 7, 2006"

But the film plot is interesting but still feels kind of let down considering. Plus we first see Han in the seriesThe action scenes and taunts are good for the film despite it flaw acting but it just a hard film to not talk about.

The protagonist is no longer surfer-boy Paul Walker, but Lucas Black as 17-year-old Sean who always escapes his problems by moving away.But Sean decides to stay in Tokyo this time to deal after gets entangled in a dirty Yakuza mess when he races against a Yakuza boss's nephew, and steals his girlfriend (unforgivably annoying Nathalie Kelley). The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) thus sees American Sean and his crude ways juxtaposed with the sleek technology of Tokyo. It is an effective contrast, and the Tokyo background provides visual stimuli throughout the film, elevating it above generic formula.But ultimately, this is ALL that is good about this film because the acting is atrocious - not any of the leads should ever be allowed to act again, even with better writing. The exception and stand-out performance in Tokyo Drift is the sexy Sung Kang as the guy who takes Sean in when he comes to Tokyo, and teaches him in the ways of 'drifting'. However, I have always seen the Fast and Furious franchise as an elaborate excuse to parade fast cars and fast women, and Tokyo Drift is no different here.5/10",Flagrant-Baronessa,"Aug 8, 2006"
8,Refreshing and innovating,"""The Fast And The Furious"" series opened the cinema for a whole new way to make car movies. This 3rd movie from this series added the cherry on the top of a sweet cake. Lots of action during the whole movie and, I must say, a very good argument. Way better than the 2nd movie with some characters very well created and also their evolution through out the movie.Although, sometimes, it seams that the story walks a bit too fast and things happen too early, this 3rd movie has one of the best arguments of the 3. And I'm still undecided if it is better or not than the 1st movie.Some really good change in this 3rd movie was the feature of drifts instead of pure racing (shown so far in the previous series). THAT is the main innovation in this series as long as in cars movies. The creators of ""The Fast and The Furious"" were PROBABLY pioneers in making underground car movies and they were surely the first doing a movie about drifting.I must say that Tokyo was indeed a very good place to film this kind of driving.Just to finish, I just wanna say there's a great surprise at the end of the movie!!! ;)",pauloshdias,"Oct 29, 2006"

i ithink its one of the best of the fast and furious series .. FF 1 , FF 2 and tokyo drift the other in the series just too many gimmickIn tokyo drift they have:
no CGI
normal car with a good modification....
normal person as a driver not a secret agent man or super soldier...
no such thing as a ""family""
more believable story than the other in the series , no car vs tanks, no car vs submarine , no car going to outerspace just car vs car

1,Worst movie ever,"For a time I didn't know which movie I had as number 1 worst movie, but now I do :) The scene where they ride downhill and try to make it ""lovestory"" kinda like, I was so embarrassed that I had to close my eyes and ears. Worst dialog ever :P Worst casting to by the way, Lucas Black gotta be one of the worst actors I've seen in a long time, what was with the accent, bad smile and stupid grin ? Every time he said something deep was just hilarious, that guy cant act for sure. Even the scenes with drifting got boring, cause its the same and same all over again, from start to end. BoooooringMy few words :)Over and out",maeha,"Jun 18, 2006"
10,Adrenaline Rush - Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift is a solid good third entry action flick!,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) in my opinion I think is a solid good action sequel, a very bashed and hated in the series. Which I don't think this movie is bad, I think is a much better movie than Furious 7. I always loved this movie, I think it is a good movie, but in the series is not the worst one, but is far from worst one that would be Furious 7. I think it was a different solid, good sequel in the series and I love it for an action film. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a fun movie to watch: it accomplishes what it set out to do and that's provide the most realistic yet gravity-defying racing sequences, backed with the eye-catching background of the electrifying, neon Tokyo. Plot-wise it suffers a bit and the acting isn't top-notch, otherwise the loud music, import cars, cityscape Tokyo, and Japanese pop culture more than make up for the flaws of the film that you'll watch it again and again.Plot: When convicted street racer Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) tries to start a new life on the other side of the world, his obsession with racing sets him on a collision course with the Japanese underworld. To survive, he will have to master drifting—a new style of racing where tricked-out cars slide through hairpin turns, defying gravity and death for the ultimate road rush.This movie is more the highest-octane installment of the hit movie franchise built for speed! There are more mind-blowing stunts and heart-pounding racing sequences than ever, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift will put you in the driver's seat. ""Strap yourself in for a blistering, super-charged ride.""-- Pete Hammond, Maxim"" The CGI I am sorry but in one way it is terrible which I really did not like when Sean (Lucas Black) and Neela (Nathalie Kelley) are slide down with the car during the car chase and they cross over the crowd of people without hitting anyone, you can see the camera, that it is made with a CGI that is the only main problem I have with the film, the rest was okay. This is a very simple film, not a big confusing plot and again this films, you know 5,6 and 7 the plots are still pretty simplistic.5 was a heist movie, 6 was this guy the evil version of you, we want him to bring him down simple.7 you killed this guy's brother, he is looking for revenge and he also try's to kill you so you get this, simple movie not complicate at all. That is one thing that this movies get right constantly.The racing in this movie: I think they did a better job than in 2, because I didn't noticed more of a CGI, because that's how they just do it now, a lot of wide shot you can tell there was a lot of practical stunt drive, it look good which I enjoyed that. I know a lot of people will put this movie lover down and I think it is a solid movie and a solid flick. This is the first time Brian Tyler made the score and this is also the first one that Justin Lin directed, he went later directing three next movies 4,5 and 6 which I love to death. I thought the direction is good, I like the resolves on the end of the movie, the sound track is good, I did not mind the cast you know. Lucas Black is the lead in this movie. Sonny Chiba is in this movie I always like the actor. This was Sung Kang's first introduction of his character Han who later appeared in 4 as a cameo, than in 5 and 6 as regular cast. Vin Diesel did returned with his character Dominic Toretto, who made a cameo scene on the end of the movie, which I thought was pretty cool. Bow Wow I didn't mind him in this movie and Nathalie Kelley was extremely hot and I really though she was much better sexy babe, than Eva Mendes was in 2 Fast 2 Furious. Nathalie Kelley lights up the screen as Neela and I would welcome her return to the series any time.Overall: Tokyo Drift gets a solid 8 by me it does lacks on the great characters and the cast of the first two movies in the series, but is redeemed by Han, awesome car scenes and a pounding score from Brian Tyler. I have enjoyed this movie and I think it is a solid action movie, I love this film and it is a step above than 2 Fast 2 Furious by me.The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a 2006 American action film directed by Justin Lin, produced by Neal H. Moritz and written by Chris Morgan. It takes place between the events of sixth and seventh films. The film stars Lucas Black, Bow Wow, Nathalie Kelley, Brian Tee and Sung Kang.8/10 Score: A- Studio: Universal Pictures Starring: Lucas Black, Bow Wow, Sung Kang, Nathalie Kelley, Brian Tee, Leonardo Nam, Brian Goodman, Zachery Ty Bryan, Nikki Griffin, Sonny Chiba and Vin Diesel Director: Justin Lin Producer: Neal H.

7,An interesting Fast Movie,"This movie is great and I think it's slept on. Every car enthusiast should love and enjoy to is movie. It's about JDM's in Tokyo and drifting, what's not to like about it? Lost people didn't like it and as a result, we're experiencing the PTSD of Fast 9 and X. This movie dared to be different and it worked. If they made another one similar to this focusing more on the Japanese car culture, it could've been a WIN. But no, we have to deal with the Fast X and I'd rather watch Transformers honestly. This is a great movie compared to most of the Fast movies. Vin diesel killed the Fast franchise. The series are becoming more like the expendables movies. If they think Fast 9 and x are great, then unplug me from this reality.",stevetelfer,"Aug 4, 2023"
2,"I'd rather eat my own head, than see this again","Well, not literally, really. I went to my friend's birthday, and this film was showing in town, i with four other friends(who happen to enjoy films like this) decided to go to this flick. The closer we got to the theater, the more i couldn't shake the feeling, that i am doing something so wrong, so satanic and amoral, that burning the bible would seem like saying a prayer at dinner.But i just couldn't leave out, as this was the birthday boy's idea and he paid for the tickets. I must also note, that to of those friends had already seen the film about three times or so.Now, to talk about the movie itself. It's bad. It's so frigging' bad. Why is it so bad? Oh, well, let's start with the acting. Our leading man, Mr. Lucas Black gives one of the most dreadful performances in years, to say the very f*****g least. This movie guarantees him a career of mindless and dull action crap, for sure. Or maybe that's what he wants? Heck, if i knew. Nathalie Kelley tries to be the mysterious hot chick, but fails miserably at what she tries to reach. The only man who saves the acting, possibly the whole movie, is Sung Kang. His character, Han, is so slick, so cool, that you can even believe an actor this good signed on for a movie this bad. Saying this movie is pointless is putting it mildly.As i said before, two of my friends had seen the movie before and knew all the lines to it by heart, if they even have one. So they were saying the lines of the actors before the actors themselves could say them. I couldn't believe there are people so tasteless in this world. After this tale of unbearable horror ended, my friends loved and decided to go for a second watch. So, i had to go too. After this experience, i simply wanted to kill and tear apart, not only my friends, but everybody else who liked this movie. Yet, i still gave this movie a 2. Why? Because of Sung Kang. He earned this movie the 2.As i mentioned, my friend paid for the movie, so no money of mine was wasted, and that's the best thing that happened through this awful experience.Do not see this film.2/10",kidboi,"Aug 24, 2006"
8,Not a bad film considering it was a Part 3,"Usually when a film has a Part III, it leaves you with, ""Why did they make a third film?"" Case in point, ""Smokey & The Bandit"". Now I am dating myself if that's the only film I can come up with when it comes to trilogies. But car movies are seldomly done in trilogies. Star Wars, The Godfather, Lord of the Rings and Back to the Future are the only exceptions that have worked in the past because there's an on-going story line.Tokyo Drift was a good film. Good plot line (if you disagree, then you're a ""Too much to think"" film-goer, stay with chick-flicks then). Good action. And of course, cool cars. The fact that it strayed away from Part I & II was a good idea. And film director, Justin Lin did an great job getting his vision to film. The mounted camera on a super-fast go-cart gave some spectacular shots.It's a good escape film with the ""new kid in town, gets beat up or loses in some sort of competition, learns from a local to be better then wins in the end."" But for a trilogy film it's excellent compared to other Part III films that have been released.",andrew-limtiaco,"Nov 2, 2006"
7,A fun car flick,"I feel like what the first two films relied on too much was CGI to make the races feel more vibrant. But there is a surprising lack of CGI here and that lack of CGI makes it feel a lot more real. As far as the races themselves go, I think the opening race (which these early Fast & Furious films had quite frequently, for those who don't know) is probably my favorite in the franchise, at least that I've seen. I'm not a super big fan of the main character (I'm terrible with names), I feel like he was not cast right and I think he was a very badly written character. In fact I'm not really fond of these characters in general. I felt like they were quite forgettable and, well, bland.If you're in the mood for a fun car flick and insane stunts, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is the film for you.",Z21708,"Jan 10, 2021"
1,May have spoilers but who cares this movie blows.,"Coming into the theater I had no hope for this movie. The first 2 were horrible and I was dragged to see this one. There are two ways to portray this movie, 1: as a joke, or 2: ""awesome"". People who do not understand what makes a ""good"" movie will love this film. First off, acting yes, was horrible from the beginning and especially to the end. Second problem, the ""culture"" of the Japanese. Nobody in Japan cares about drifting, except for those fisherman of course, and not every teenage girl is a skank in a short skirt looking for ""awesome"" drifters. The plot was ridiculous, completely predictable. Hmm, love story with an outsider, dad gets involved with drifting, and o yeah someone dies. When Lucas Black's Japanese friend crashes his car, why did the car blow up? Was he carrying C-4 with him? The drifting scenes looked like they came right out of Need For Speed Underground, but without the point total on top. If you see this movie, at least get someone else to pay for you or just do not go at all. For the people that liked/loved this movie, they need to watch what a real movie is such as Fight Club, Reservoir Dogs, V for Vendetta, or Pulp Fiction.",Lgmsbroncs07,"Jun 21, 2006"

7,It's All Drifting,"OK Now I'm on Tokyo Drift .... Let's see, What I like about TD is the introduction of H A N Z. I love him in this installment with his fine self. I love his calm cool demeanor and those eyes. Yes those eyes ... He came in and played himself it's not like he took on the role of any of the other characters but then again I guess that may have been part of being allowed to use the franchise name and continue to push out installments. Just in case the originals ever got on the same page and in agreement to all come back and do another installment. But this installment I like because of the ""drifting"". It was a fresh and new at the time and I thought it was some of the better drifting I'd ever seen had me wishing I could do that and wanting to move to Tokyo ....I'm such a big kid, I know LOL. I don't think Bow Wow brought anything to the line up or the franchise. He was like a Luda type character. All the while I'm sitting here typing this review I'm watching TD and other than the drifting and Hanz, it was not as good as I remember.",hersheedontplay,"Nov 25, 2016"
1,"Horrible movie,","Possible spoiler warningThis movie was horrible as I kind of predicted it would be. The lack of reasonable plot and plot holes spoiled it.As a Navy brat that lived in Japan when I was a kid, I for a fact know that Navy kids do not attend Japanese schools, they attend American schools. Navy officers do not live in shacks in Tokyo, they live on the base, because they get big houses for 25% of the price. In Tokyo drift they do neither of these things. I'm almost 100% sure that the Yakuza have no interest whatsoever in drifting. They'd prefer to be making money. I'm also sure that not every drift car in Japan is sponsored and covered with stickers. As a person who is/was pasionate about the sport of drifting, the way this movie portrayed it was a joke. Basically this was another attempt by Hollywood to grab onto pop culture and warp it to their ends to make money. I fear all it will lead to is idiot kids killing themselves and others.",onig-1,"Jun 19, 2006"

4,Who green lighted this?,"What an incredible tour De force of crap. Of course I didn't care for the first two movies in this series. However I do like cars and racing. Why not just make a good documentary about street racing? Having lived in Japan for 3 years the idiosyncrasies are over whelming. For one Tokyo has some of the heaviest traffic 24/7 in the world. Maybe they could drive like that at 3:AM for a few blocks, but not how they show it in the film. I will say the cars were great and so was the driving. The girls were hot too. Sorry but the story was disappointing at best. His little hip-hop sidekick was annoying 5 seconds after he showed up on screen. The acting was total garbage as well. If both of those kids were military brats, why didn't they go to the American school on base? Do you know how hard it is to learn Japanese at 17 or 18 years old, and do well enough to keep up in school? Give me a break! This is a great looking movie, but fare from good entertainment. The story line is weak as water and the characters are paper-thin.",djray65,"Apr 21, 2007"
8,Much better than the others.,"Got a free screening pass to see it 6-12, saw it with some car buddies, the dork I am took notes.This movie had more semblance of a plot than the rest of the franchise, the action stayed fresh and actually flowed with the plot, and the characters actually had motivation this time! There weren't any HUGE glaring inaccuracies (other than daddy throwing sonny the keys to a car with NO ENGINE in it...) The three cameos in the film were well placed, though a bit campy at the very end. The cars and action sequences were amazingly choreographed, one even leaving my whole theatre clapping for the protagonist.I give 8/10 because of low expectations, and being totally blown away when it was much better than I expected.",la-fashionista,"Jun 13, 2006"
6,Different from the rest.,"""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" veers off the established path of its predecessors by transporting us to Tokyo, introducing a fresh narrative centered around the art of drifting rather than traditional racing. This third installment distinguishes itself with a heavier emphasis on visual storytelling, capturing the neon-lit streets and the unique underground drift culture. Although it departs from the familiar faces and racing styles of the first two films, ""Tokyo Drift"" offers a compelling exploration of growth and redemption, wrapped in a visually stunning package that pays homage to a distinct automotive discipline. Its deviation from the series' formula marks it as a standout chapter, enriching the franchise with its unique perspective.",schmittfalte,"Feb 25, 2024"
1,Utterly worthless waste of time and money,"TFATF is THE most pointless and artistically redundant franchise in history! The first, which was a total piece of crap, gave way to a tepid, moronic sequel and now, after three years of peace and quiet we are punished with Tokyo Drift. The most American Japan you will ever see in a film! Although there is even less of a story than the other two (if that's possible) it is still a carbon copy of its predecessors and offers absolutely nothing new. The characters are crap! The action is lame, soulless, overcut and PG13-friendly and is obviously 'inspired' by hours and hours of endless Playstation.The only reason I went to see this turkey is because I LOVE Japanese girls. But, like I said, this is the most American Japan you will ever see, so there is hardly any of them at all. And all Japanese girls are shot from behind so you can't actually see that they're Japanese. Whether or not this is because they are just LA girls masquerading as Japanese Girls or it's because Universal didn't want to alienate American audiences I don't know. But if you're expecting anything remotely resembling a culture clash then ditch that preconception. I guess that kind of thing would be too difficult for the writers of this trash to muster. And how the hell does hillbilly main character Sean Boswell master the Japanese language in a few days? It's no secret that TFATF films operate on a declining scale. And, forgive me for sounding like a fuddy-duddy, I feel that they send the wrong message to the wrong generation.Speed gets you babes. Speed gets you babes. Speed gets you babes. Speed gets you babes. Speed gets you babes. Speed gets you babes. Speed gets you babes. Speed gets you babes.The film is even less subtle than the above paragraph. Despite the disclaimer at the end, warning naive audience members of the dangers of such driving (such people cannot read anyway and left as soon as the screen went black) I must point out that too many impressionable kids forget this is just a stupid fantasy movie. A dumb disclaimer at the end isn't enough to dissuade them from trying all the crap that is featured in this movie.But that is to be expected from lowest-possible-common-denominator garbage.",CuriosityKilledShawn,"Jun 21, 2006"

7,True to the Title!!!,"This movie was Fast. This movie was Furious. And all in an okay way. Being a major fan of the franchise, I was eager to see how the third would turn out. Knowing someone in the movie biz, who worked on the movie, Neal H. Moritz (His credits being the producer of the first Fast & Furious Movies, Vin Diesel's xXx, xXx State of the Union, SWAT, and more) I got to be the first of many to go to the World Premiere. The movie was entertaining, not the greatest storyline, but this movie had the most intense and exhilarating car chases, probably ever put on the big screen. Lucas Black, the lead in this movie, playing the cool, car maniac, did a good job to fill the shoes Paul and Vin left behind. If you are a fan of the first two, I do suggest this movie to you. And even if you're not a fan, but you are into the Drift world of Car racing, this is your movie. In my opinion, The FAST & FURIOUS movies, are some of my top favorite movies of all time. So I must say that even with a somewhat weak storyline, this movie did earn the title FAST & THE FURIOUS.",wizmrs,"Jun 4, 2006"
7,Better then I had expected.,"First of all, I loved The Fast and The Furious. It had an interesting undercover cop story with a little illegal street racing flavor to it. Of course Vin Diesel's character Dominic Toretto stole the show and as soon as I found out 2 Fast 2 Furious had Paul Walker starring and no sign of Vin Diesel I knew it would suck big time, and it did. I hated 2F2F because of how they dumbed down the story into something I could write within a matter of hours. My little brother got the DVD so I checked out the deleted scenes and what do ya know! they had cut out some scenes which would have made it a bad movie instead of the piece of crap it turned out to be.As soon as I heard Dominic Toretto would make a cameo appearance I wanted to see Tokyo Drift. Yes I wanted to watch a full feature film just for the 20 seconds we got to see Dominic Toretto. But aside from the bad actors like Bow Wow (why not just use another rapper while we're at it) the story came back to the franchise! I went to see this movie with expectations lower then those for a Steven Segall movie but I was wrong! Dead wrong because a lot of things The Fast and The Furious had were back with a Japanese twist to it! Once again the main character starts out as an incompetent driver and eventually turns out to be one of the elite. Also, once again there's a girl involved! And once again there's some actual killing going on. Not that that made it a better movie but 2F2F did feel like they wanted to keep the rating as low as possible. If you liked The Fast and The Furious then your going to like this as well. No it's definitely NOT better but at least now they could close the trilogy without a big flop like 2F2F.",kevin-tufo,"Aug 10, 2006"
4,Terrible,"This movie was truly difficult to watch, and many parts we just skipped through as we cringed through some of the scenes and dialogue.It's hard to take seriously this movie about teenagers racing when the main ""teenage"" character looks like he is in his 30's and still attending school. Many of the other ""kids"" also looked way too old for their roles.The plot and story-line are weak, characters shallow and unsuited to their roles. This movie did not feel part of the franchise, and looks to be some bad idea turned into a bad movie. The current IMDB 6.1 rating is generous, in my opinion.I found the movie frustrating and couldn't wait until we had skipped through to the end.",bluesquirrel2004,"Mar 2, 2023"

Which is refreshing, seeing as the basis of the movie is racing cars. The plot is a little thin, in that there really isn't one for the majority of the movie. The last few minutes it pulls something together to end the movie. Acting is a little subpar, the main character is a bit dry, but it doesn't detract too much. Don't go in expecting an Oscar worthy performance and you'll be pleasantly surprised by the quality of action.",Calicodreamin,"Aug 10, 2019"

Love fast and furious movies,they're fun to watch, so was watching them all again, and can't help myself now but have to comment on this movie because it is sooooooooooooooo annoying thinking about the fact someone, or more than one person, actually got paid for the casting in this movie!?Nothing personal against Lucas Black, not saying he's a bad actor, but what kind of mentally challenged guy or team of people thought he was the right fit to play a 17yo troubled teen in this movie????I mean seriously?? Whoever payed anyone to do the casting for this movie, call me next time in stead to cast ur movie and I will do a million times better for free...Picking a 35year old looking guy to play a 17yo kid (with a terrible southern accent)... It blows my mind... Again, not judging Lucas Black, if someone would pay me a lot of money to play a 15yo girl in a movie once, fk it, I will do it too.But I'm a 34yo man, I am not right to play that part! I'm writing this review in the middle of watching the movie, and going to finish watching it now.But will still be so annoyed the whole movie long watching some 35yo looking dude struggling to act like a 17yo kid...Really worst casting ever, they might as well had anthony hopkins play the main charachter, would've been just as believable.",davidplees,"Sep 16, 2019"
8,The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,"When I am watching the Fast and Furious movies I am not looking for a mind bending plot, I am looking to be entertained. That is exactly what this movie did. I really liked the how they kept the street racing aspect, but put a spin on it. The drifting was really cool, and the final race was arguably the best ending to any Fast and Furious movie at the time (It definitely wasn't after the later films came out). They probably should have brought back the original crew in this movie instead of waiting till the fourth installment, but just like 2 Fast 2 Furious, it ended up working out. I also really liked how this movie takes place after Fast and Furious 4, 5, and 6. I am so happy they did that and if you watched this movie, you know why.Don't listen to the critics, this was a good movie if you can get past the shaky plot, and decent acting, I recommend this for you. The movie did make up for that with great directing from Justin Lin who came back for Fast 4, 5, and 6, and some very likable characters like Han (Who is the only person besides a cameo from Sean in Furious 7 to come back). All in all, this was a pretty entertaining movie.",kaden_lewis,"Jul 3, 2021"

He's sent to Japan to live with his soldier dad and there he's assimilated in the Japanese underground world of... DRIFTING! If you plan on seeing this film, prepare to leave your brain at the door because the plot here is almost non-existent and instead prepare to be hammered with an excessive amount of EYE CANDY.Hot babes, hot cars, a hot city and hot lead characters will fill your eyes while Sung Kang (Better Luck Tomorrow) delivers a terrific performance that adds some much-needed humanity and drama that has been lacking with its predecessor.Still not as good as its first older brother, but definitely better than its 2nd bro. Go see it, summer's finally taken off!!",Joventino,"Jun 16, 2006"

6,"For some sick reason, I actually liked The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift","I just saw the first two Fast and the Furious films a couple days ago and I had this gigantic fear of watching Tokoy Drift, I wasn't into the first two films, and this seemed like another guaranteed let down. But since I rented all the films simultaneously, I just wanted to get my money's worth, so I watched The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift this evening, I have to say that I was totally surprised. Even though it was typical and the plot was predictable, I still liked this film a lot better. I feel like this was the story that they should have started out with, it seemed a little more realistic. Well, most of it anyways, not to mention the killer ending they had, but I won't spoil. But The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift has a great story and an unbelievably good looking cast, you can't help but love it.Sean has just raced the toughest jock in high school and well, you guessed it, they got hurt doing so. Since the jock has a good connection Sean is in trouble for it, his mom doesn't know what to do with him, so she does what any sensible parent would do, she sends him to another country! Japan, to be with his navy father, but he quickly discovers the under ground world of ""drifting"", which is actually racing, but it sounds a lot cooler, doesn't it? But he gets involved with the good guy who vs. the bad guys who belong to a Japanese mafia, and falls for the bad guy's girlfriend and they race each other, you know how the story always goes.The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is typical and silly, but for some reason, I really did enjoy it. I think it just had a better story. Either that, or I figure maybe I was just in a better mood when I watched this film opposed to the other two films. But I did enjoy The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift and would recommend it for mindless entertainment, after all, this has cars and good looking people, what young person could ask for more? Well, I'm sure there are many different things I could ask for, but I got my hour and a half's worth.6/10",Smells_Like_Cheese,"Dec 4, 2007"

7,This franchise drifts back into fun,"After an entertaining first movie and nearly unwatchable second, Tokyo Drift brings this franchise back into the positive with an absolutely refreshingly fun and unique twist on the formula. Set almost entirely in Japan, which is notorious for winding mountain roads perfect for drifting (as seen in Initial-D, which is recommended if you liked this, both the movie and the anime), this movie brings back the cars and action sorely underutilized in the second movie and spices things up with a bit of Japanese culture and swanky mid-race camera tricks.Tokyo Drift won't be winning any awards for acting; the acting here is cheesy and oftentimes teeters on bad, particularly when it comes to Neela (played by Nathalie Kelley, who switches accents from scene to scene and seems to think she's in a Disney channel show). But that's not why we're here, is it? I didn't expect a masterpiece of acting when I watched this so I won't knock the movie for it. What I will say was disappointing was the focus on American characters in Japan (for what it's worth, I am American myself). Initially, I didn't know the main character of Tokyo Drift was an American, though as the movie played out I accepted it since it's genuinely entertaining to watch an Alabama boy try to assimilate into Japanese culture. But quite a few main characters weren't Japanese, including Neela and Twinkie. For being set in Japan, I was hoping for more Japanese characters. Han was awesome and quickly rose to be my favorite character of the franchise yet. While I won't spoil anything here, the choices made for Han's character disappointed me greatly, though I have to give the film credit for actually *going* there.Overall, I found this the most entertaining film in the Fast and the Furious franchise yet. While I know the films branch out from here, I only wish for more racing/drifting films set in Japan because it's stuff like this I can't get enough of. The climax race of this film (American muscle versus Japanese drift) was an absolute thrill. More like this, please!",fewald139,"Aug 26, 2019"

7,Solid,"I have seen the other reviews of this film that are negative and I just don't understand. This is no high concept, high-brow. This is girls, cars and loud soundtrack. What did you think it was going to be? Some great racing scenes. This could have easily just been another racing for cash film, but it actually was smart in pulling in the drift scene. Same cars, but different style of racing.Overall I thought the characters were fun. Again, nothing high concept here. Just enough info for you to separate the good guys and bad guys. Throw in a little romance and there you have the formula that made the other two films in this franchise hits.",RCWjr,"Jun 18, 2006"
1,Disappointing to say the least.,"For being an American movie on a Japanese concept, I first expected it to be a mess. But after checking out the movie website I saw that they did some homework, so I had moderate-low expectations going in. And with those expectations, I was rather disappointed. It was no Shuto Kousoku Trial and I'm well surprised that Keiichi Tsuchiya dared have anything to do with it.For starters the dialogue was terrible generic canned phrases all through the movie, but that was to be expected of a mainstream Hollywood production. Most notably would have to be the camera work which is the choppiest work I've ever seen done. In an attempt to make scenes more dramatic and appear faster than they were, the fast camera movement only wound up leaving the viewer with mere pieces of what was going on, rather than conveying an actual scene; it wasn't styled either, it was just bad. Even for being obviously low budget (canned dialogue, little scenery, etc.) the plot was clearly quite formulaic and the main character simply embarrassing to watch. I don't even want to start on the hair-thin plot and unnecessary sexualization. Maybe I've just grown out of that junk.There were, however, two or three good (yet painfully brief) scenes that just had a good feeling to the way they were done (like they kept the camera still for more than a second and combined elements like plot and environment). Also, the character Han is fantastic in his Japanese manner of doing things, but his character is ruined by two significant events, the first of which is something he does that is unfortunately way out of character. That's what brings this movie up to a 3/10 rating for me.",soulshinobi,"Jun 17, 2006"
6,The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006),"I just went to go see (The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift)on it's opening night in the U.S. it was OK. The same fast cars, fine girls, crashes. The old character's are gone but a character from the past 1st shows up at the end, if u liked fast and the furious or 2 fast 2 furious go see it but don't expect it to better than the 1st or 2nd because its not and anyone will tell you that but if u are a fan fast cars, hot girls - may i say Asian girls- go see it. If your asking is it worth the money or the time the answer is yes. Is it something thats gone blow you out of your seat the answer is no. I rate it six because it doesn't stink but its not amazing but its better than average movie.",yosephcool72,"Jun 16, 2006"
6,indulgent popcorn fluff,"Rev head Sean has been in trouble with the law for awhile. Hitting his third strike when racing through a construction site, he's shipped over to Japan to live with his father. Instantly on the wrong side of everything, it's not long before he's back into the racing world, introduced to a different style of racing; drifting, using the tightly constructed car parks for races. To full of himself, Sean takes on DK; Drift King, using DK's business partner Han's car. Losing the race and smashing Han's car, Sean becomes in debt to him to pay for the car.The whole of the Fast and the Furious franchise is all about the spectacle. Glossy, fast paced action, great cars, hot women, an abundance of over indulgence. The spectacle is what made the franchise so interesting and so popular. Slapping together a story line to serve the action and badly written dialog are easily over looked, only to the extent that you deliver some amazing action sequences. Director Justin Lin has on account delivered some amazing action scenes. The energy and adrenaline run hard and fast, with tyres screeching at ear piercing levels. This does run off set pieces; the chase through Tokoy city is one great example, leaving you just waiting for the next piece to arrive, though the down side is you have to sit through terrible acting and plot ridden story.When your characters are so broadly drawn and one dimensional, you don't give your actor much to go on; yet they aren't that talented in the first place. Verging on Grease levels of older actors playing teenagers, Lucas Black doesn't have much strength to carry this as the lead Sean, walking around with a stunned mullet. Sonny Chiba comes off cartoonish as a Yakuza boss. Brian Tee lacks menace as DK. Sung Kang does the best performance as Han, not taking his role to any real serious level.If you start to think about all its inconsistencies or take this serious for even a second, it hurts your mind. It's a piece of entertaining popcorn fluff.",nobbytatoes,"Jun 25, 2006"
6,It's actually alright,"American teen Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) gets into serious trouble street racing. He is set to go to jail, but then he is sent off to live with his military dad over in Tokyo. His dad's rules are to go to school and don't drive. Almost immediately, he breaks the second rule, makes an enemy of D.K., and gets in debt to Han (Sung Kang).Lucas Black is a good solid actor. It makes up for the fact that most of the film had none of the original cast. Sung Kang who would go on to play Han in other F&F movies is very effective. The same cannot be said for Bow Wow or Nathalie Kelley. It's mostly Bow Wow who sticks out like a sore thumb, and it has nothing to do with him being black. The cars are pretty like always in the franchise. The drift driving is interesting for about a minute. The chases have been done better. There is a bit too much CGI in the chases. The one thing that is great about this movie is the Japanese locations. It's nice to see the franchise really go to Tokyo.",SnoopyStyle,"Mar 30, 2014"
5,An Average By The Numbers Action Movie,"24 October 2006. This movie did what it was designed to do - show of fast cars and a little bit of female legs for the young men going to see this movie and make a little profit for the producers. This predictable movie without much more provided the typical thrills and melodrama that any tame male macho movie is supposed to, except for its more exotic locale - Tokyo - which is used to a degree. While the plot is mostly straight forward and the action decent, there isn't much else, except for a small attempt at avoiding a fight scene and a weak attempt to introduce Japanese culture to the American movie scene or vice versa. The chase scene that includes lots of drifting unfortunately was handled in the most obviously set up way with cars set up in patterned, artificial ways so that safety came first (while essential) really made the movie look cheap. The character development of course was flat, the relationships nothing special, the integration of Japanese culture only mild - not much new or learned here. Just a fast-paced, not even that sexy, a movie that at least held together decently. Five out of Ten Stars.",tabuno,"Jan 22, 2019"
6,I didn't get it.,"I was so excited to see the next F&F....that being said, the first 75% of Tokyo Drift had some moments, but for the most part, I was bored with it. I could never buy into some of the characters (ie the main girl, I forget her name) which made it hard to take in the movie as a whole. The story line was there, but it just didn't do it for me.The ending was pretty cool. From the final race to the ending with the cool Dodge (and who was in it). A sequel without any of the regulars doesn't make sense.This should've been a movie by itself, not of the Fast & Furious kingdom. Maybe I would've liked it a little better....maybe not.I gave a 6 of 10 just because it had the hot girls and hot cars, otherwise, it underwhelmed me.",NoMoreFreaks,"Dec 31, 2013"
2,Truly shocking to watch,"As an expat living in Japan, I had resisted watching Tokyo drift as long as possible due to the overwhelmingly bad reputation the movie has. Despite which, I can say with sheer confidence that the last 17 years have done nothing to improve this film. The plot is both non existent and extremely pandering to some sort of American feverdream about what Japan is (spoiler, Japan is nothing like this). It only takes a few minutes of scrolling through the IMDB page to realise that none of the main actors are Japanese and the majority of the filming was done in LA. Threadbare plot and complete lack of cultural understanding aside, nothing is as unforgivable as the main actor who can barely read his English language lines off the page, not to mention Japanese -- though to be fair, no one seems to be able to speak Japanese in this film (Was there even a language coach onsite?). Long story short, if you want to see an adult man masquerading as a teenager in essentially a rehash of the worst tropes of the other F&F films, you're in the right place. Shoutout to all the other incredible reviewers down here in the 1-3 star range, I experienced a wider range of emotions reading these reviews than watching the entirety of the movie.",megandbeale,"Feb 1, 2023"
8,Much better than the other 2,Where do i start with this film? When i first heard this film wasn't going to have any of the original cast in it i felt rather disappointed but my opinion has totally changed after seeing it for the first time.The cast in it are great.Lucas plays his part well as does bow wow and the guy who plays Han. The things that stood out for me were the racing scenes mainly.There are a lot more than there were in the other 2 films and in my own opinion the races in this third are a lot better than any in the first two. The story isn't half bad either.I actually prefer this one to the 2nd film because of that as well as the racing. This is definitely a must see for all fans of the other two films though.,bopper-5,"Jun 27, 2006"
7,High-octane direction makes it entertaining,"Shawn is a young delinquent with a habit of getting in trouble due to his driving habits. His latest offense has him going to Tokyo to avoid jail time. It isn't long before he meets up with the car culture there and gets an embarrassing taste of drift racing by losing to a local champ who also has connections with the Yakuza. Soon Shawn is drawn into the underground world and a predictable, but stylish summer-fare ensues.The story here is one you've either seen before or will comfortably predict. Also, when going to see a second sequel to a franchise that is all about cars, what can you really expect? Nothing too spectacular on either story or action side of the film, but this is a surprising strong entry to a series, seeing that it is number 3 of course.The acting is decent with the clichés not being to overplayed or outrunning themselves, but rather just acting as connective tissue for the film's main event - the breakneck racing scenes. Which is exactly what the first film didn't quite reach and what the horrible second film in this franchise seriously lacked. The racing scenes here are possibly the best in the F&F franchise with a high octane direction that makes them very exciting to watch. They incorporate a lot of interesting shots - both CGI and real-life - mix it in with slow motion and all sorts of pans, which is then topped of with some frenetic editing and a hard rockin' soundtrack. That makes for some good fast- paced summer fun. 7/10Rated PG-13: violence, frenetic action, and some profanity",BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,"Jun 22, 2006"
4,The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006),"Directed by Justin Lin. Starring Lucas Black, Sung Kang, Brian Tee, Nathalie Kelley, Shad ""Lil' Bow Wow"" Moss, Brian Goodman, Sonny Chiba, Leonardo Nam, Zachery Ty Bryan, Nikki Griffin, Lynda Boyd. (PG-13)After getting busted for racing Tim ""The Tool Man"" Taylor's kid, American teen Black is shipped off to Tokyo to live with his Naval officer father (Goodman); there he attracts the attention of a girl (Kelley) who looks like she came from Japanese High School Musical, and her flat-nosed boyfriend (Tee), whose uncle (Chiba) has powerful Yakuza ties. Third outing has little connection to the rest of the series--at least, until a little retconning was done--but offers much of the same thing one has come to expect from the franchise: sleek autos, bare mid-riffs, incessant soundtrack cues, instructions to turn off the brain, etc. Lame, barely-existent plot spends way too much time away from revving engines; of the cast, only Kang's zen calm style is worth positive notice. The drifting scenes are sometimes engaging, except when mediocre CGI and aggressive editing spoil the fun (good luck figuring out what the heck happens during the last minute or so of the climactic chase). Even though it was and still is the least successful ""The Fast and the Furious"" movie--and nearly killed the then-flimsy franchise--director Lin proved the best fit yet, and was brought back for the next three entries. (Not much of) a surprise cameo pops up at the end for those who stick around that long.37/100",fntstcplnt,"Feb 10, 2020"

6,Better than F2!,"Without any of the original cast members I wondered how this installment would play out. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it more than '2 Fast 2 Furious'.The premise and the characters were much better than it's predecessor. This standalone sequel had lots more action than F2, and the action sequences are stunning! I cared more about the characters, and thought the actors did them justice with good acting. With the lack of comic relief that was just too much in F2, this was more serious and therefore more suspenseful.The events leading to the finale was well set-up as it built to a climax. By that time we knew the characters, and there's been great character development - especially from the lead, Sean (played by Lucas Black). Off course the stunning cars are back - more impressive than F2, and the film has a great rocking soundtrack for most part. The stunts are jaw-dropping.The finale was a thrilling, fast-paced visual spectacle. The film has a highly effective score - especially during the finale. Everything about this film was better than F2. Wow, this was incredible. I loved it! This is a darn good action film!",paulclaassen,"Jul 24, 2020"
6,Not Bad Not Great,Overall rating 6.4: The third film is definitely the black sheep of the franchise. I don't mind Sean in this movie but I would've liked to see Paul Walker in this film. I liked Vin Diesels cameo in the film and I think it was a nice touch. The film isn't as exciting as the previous two instalments and I think that Takashi is a pretty mediocre villain. The film does have some good race scenes but the movie lacks solid characters making for a ok 3rd outing.,twpain,"Jun 7, 2020"
4,"Only worth watching as part of the full ""F&F"" series, and after 6","In 2006, ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" undoubtedly deserved to be panned by critics. The series had fallen so far off the course that only its ugliest, most formulaic bits stayed alive. It's only as part of the franchise that was revived three years later and has gone on to become a billion-dollar enterprise that ""Tokyo Drift"" reclaims some sense of its dignity.Let's get the good out of the way. ""Tokyo Drift"" was a vital proving ground for director Justin Lin, who would go on to make the next three ""Fast & Furious"" movies. His work on this entry was too good for the material, frankly. His shot variety and the editing team give the film a legitimate action feel that the first two films don't even come close to touching. As much as the film overloads on race sequences, Lin nails them.As for why screenwriter Chris Morgan got the long-term gig for this franchise after his work on this film, consider me stumped. The story of Alabama teenager Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) shipping off to Tokyo, discovering the drift racing scene and burrowing his way into the innermost circle is ambitiously preposterous.Obviously the plot of the ""Fast & Furious"" movies is known to be second fiddle to a handful of other components, but this particular plot has some problems as far as race – and unfortunately not the car kind of race, but the people kind. In a nutshell, the story of ""Tokyo Drift"" is misunderstood troubled white teenager flees the consequences of his actions to Tokyo where his dad lives, defies his father's wishes, asserts himself into a racing gang, stands up to the cocky Japanese ""Drift King"" (Brian Tee), tries to steal the man's girlfriend (Nathalie Kelley), earns the trust of his partner (Sung Kang) and ultimately aims to prove he's better than him. Only one of the five major characters in this movie is actually Japanese, and it's the bad guy. The movie is very interested in appropriating Japanese culture and aesthetics for its mostly non- Japanese cast. For starters you have Black, who looks like he's in his thirties and is playing a teenager. Boswell is also written to have the same personality and temperament as Paul Walker's O'Conner, so he's essentially a stand-in/replacement. As for Boswell's first friend, he's of course played by a black rap star (Shad Moss a.k.a. ""Bow Wow"") and the girl he's after? She's an ethnic Australian. Tee's D.K. is painted as the bully, so he doesn't stand as much of an exception. Only Kang's character Han has dimension beyond stereotype, but Kang is a Korean-American actor. The producers' foresight to bring the Han character into future ""Fast & Furious"" films and paint ""Tokyo Drift"" as taking place after the sixth movie was surprisingly astute. When viewed after the next three films instead of before, Han becomes more than just the most interesting character in the movie, but the character we're most interested in given his character arc in those other films. It also makes the movie's surprising cameo at the end make a lot of sense. All this to say, ""Tokyo Drift"" might be garbage as a standalone movie, but given what the franchise has become, Morgan used future movies to position what once seemed like an accident/stop-gap film into being a spin-off. In other words, if you're going to put yourself through ""Tokyo Drift,"" do it after watching the fourth, fifth and sixth ""Fast & Furious"" movies. Lin's style does give ""Tokyo Drift"" some additional value, but for most people it won't be enough to watch it under any other circumstance but as part of the series.~Steven CThanks for reading!

6,The Third Installment Of The Fun Story,"The third sequel to the saga that is fun and ultimately proves to be a solid addition to the entire franchise.Yes, it doesn't have the same amount of fun as the previous two, but it's still good enough and gives us enough action to make it worth watching.The action this time takes place in Japan, and the main character is a teenager who goes to his father to avoid a possible prison sentence. There he gets involved with potentially suspicious characters and that's where the plot begins.We have some good races in the film, bad guys that our hero has to defeat, and a love interest. Everything you need for a fun movie.And the movie, for all its faults, is fun, starting with the great cars, to the hilariously entertaining villains and some good action scenes.Of course, not every film in the franchise will be of the same quality, but at least it meets the minimum criteria, which is to be entertaining and not bore the audience with things that have no place in a film like this.The film certainly deserves its place in the story, and in the end it turned out to be worth watching. Solid entertainment.",dk777,"Mar 20, 2023"
2,Stylized street racer,"Follows a similar theme to the previous two, but character development is marginally better. Babes and cars as fabulous as always, female lead is to die for. Anti-heroes all ridiculously over the top, when we all know REAL hard-core criminals are discreetly deadly. Hero slow to learn and doggedly persistent in his ability to get himself in trouble. Not good but we're into cars right? At least there were no insulting gobbledygook ladled with 'tuner' terms that made no sense like the first one. Racing is as unrealistic as the previous two (when your opponent is catching you, change up. Again.) but some spectacular driving moments could be picked out from the stylized pap, watch out for the drift into a ramp and the top-of-third on-the-limiter full opposite lock moment in the streets. I thought it bad, despite the fantastic Tokyo backdrop and the girls making me want to go jump on a plane from the cinema, but I'll probably put the DVD in my collection next to the other two when it's released. What can I say? I'm into cars :)",rob-mitchell-2,"Jun 14, 2006"

7,For Once Take The Movie For What It Is!!!!!!!!!,"DAHMMMMM!!!!! For once would you people take a movie for what it is??? Why does every movie that does well on this site have to be a groundbreaking, heart touching, and life changing experience??? The one word to sum up this movie is ""great"". If you love great looking, suped up cars, hot women (especially hot Asian women) this movie is for you. The action in the movie was basically non-stop. There was always a race or chase or something happening to keep the movie flowing. It was never boring and you always were waiting to see what would happen next.Of course there is some cheesy dialogue and a tiny bit of weak acting here and there but its a great action movie and especially if your into cars.Even my girlfriend who I had to basically drag into the theater enjoyed it a lot.The icing on the cake was Vin Diesel's cameo at the end. It was great to see him back behind the wheel and I hope that maybe he would be interested in doing another fast and furious with him starring in it.Simply for what the movie is, its a great movie. I wish this would have been the sequel to the original because if it was I think the series would still be a strong and popular franchise.So all you people who are giving it bad reviews and low rating need to have there head examined.

No rating,The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,"Given the target audience I can understand the decision to cast Asian actors with American accents as Japanese characters, but there is a depressing number of supporting actors and extras that have clearly never been west of Orange County.The hero looks utterly gormless and spends the running time grinning like an idiot and staring wide-eyed in amazement at newfangled alien technology like chopsticks and sandals. Watching him act is like watching a retarded child struggle with his shoelaces - tragic yet cruelly hilarious. His father's in the Navy - we know this because all his clothes have ""NAVY"" written on them - and even though judging by his apartment he's dirt poor he can still afford an endless stream of plane tickets to back up his threats to send the poor retarded boy home. The lead actress is a bizarre-looking, hideously unattractive creature, and one of the strangest choices for a female lead in a teen movie in recent memory. No one in the entire cast has a shred of talent between them.A hotshot racer at home, to make the grade on the streets of Tokyo our hero must first learn to master the ""Tokyo drift"" - an awesome, almost mythical driving technique that turns out to be, um, skidding.It fails completely to make any decent use of a city that is as cinematic and beautiful as they come, it's filled with loud, obnoxious rap and rock music, it doesn't have an original bone in it's body and about the only thing to recommend it is that in the first half at least there is a pleasing number of very attractive young women in very tiny skirts.",I_John_Barrymore_I,"Apr 10, 2009"

Now, having seen him in other things I think he's a fine actor, but even he can't pull that off, what with a full beard (not even clean-shaven!) and chest hair that sticks out of his t-shirt.This movie requires an extraordinary amount of ""suspension of disbelief"", but get past that and you will find an excellent popcorn movie.",implaxible,"Dec 17, 2006"

9/10. Interesting ,new, attracting, revolutionary for it's timeThe acting:

7,"Closer the first one, much better than the second.","There should have been the first movie and then this movie. There shouldn't have been FaF 2, which was not very good at all.Tokyo Drift is decent... so OK they got an actor that's not far off from Paul Walker (or Keanu Reeves), but they've basically completed the import car scene by taking it to where the import cars come from. Japan. Storyline is of course not realistic nor is it feasible where the first of the series, Fast and Furious, held its own. But it's not completely bad like the 2Fast 2Furious, which was successful anyhow because of the cars and actions sequences.The visual effects are beautiful in this film and the action/drifting sequences are second to none when it comes to artful stunt driving sequences. The professionals do a great job with the cars, you get to see popular spots of japan and the art of drifting racing through some crazy stunts, such as when they drift up the spiralling driveway in the parking structure.The characters weren't challenged in this film so, acting was minimal and rhetoric was shallow but it wasn't about the actors and storyline, but about the cars and the action.",phrixion,"Sep 6, 2006"

No rating,don't expect too much and you'll have fun.,"don't come in expecting good acting or a believable script. don't even bother following the story. you'll watch this because you want to see shiny cars whizz around and fantastic camera angles. if you do this, you will have a good time. my hands even got clammy at one point because of the action, which is something I can't say for the first. personally, they should have just done away with story lines and just shoehorned in as many race scenes as possible. all the chases and races get a thumbs up from me, but it would have been nice to care a little more about the 'hero'. there really wasn't any of the same character dynamics like the original, even the showdown between the protagonist and villain felt a little forced. you don't really feel like rooting for anyone, but that's okay since it's the cars that carry the movie.",modrngarde,"Jun 15, 2006"
7,Need for speed: Underground,Sean Boswell is an American having passion for car races. Once a time when this passion sends him out 2 jail in-order 2 escape this he goes 2 Tokyo 2 live with his father and study there. But his passion is boosted there by illegal street races. He thinks 2 crank-spot the races but to find Drifts as his disappointment about which he knows nothing. There r neither drags nor sprints but drifts where the driver has 2 curl through very sharp turns retaining his balance with his speed & balance. So Sean tries his luck 2 learn the styles from his rival's friend. He loves his rival's girlfriend which makes the thing worse.Now how he succeeds and gets his love that's the story. The overall movie experience was pretty good. But the plots is not the exact sequel of its former versions.The story also charges as it's all about racing. There is no story in it. the film gets dull sometimes but then it keeps u engaged. But it has not lived up to the mark as its predecessors. The environment is exactly the same as in the game NFS:Underground 2& Most Wanted released by EA Games. If you like the race winds & Japanese chicks then go and take a look at this. Still I'd give it 7 outta 10.,buntyonline,"Aug 21, 2006"
6,cars in the rising sun,"Mark Kermode always warns against seeing films which are based on computer games. Theyare all meant to be awful without any plotting instead relying on brand recognition and glossy producing and a couple of good looking women. Go back and watch Citizen Kane then. This is fun, rookie driver with dark past, we've heard it over and over again for 60 years ""I'm troubled, I let someone down"" so we know where we're starting from. He goes to Japan to take part in a lame macho, genital waving affair of motor racing. The usual dichotomy of good and bad guys who fit clear personality types with no ambiguity as usual. Then the cars do their thing and thats what you've been waiting for. I and some others ended up seeing this as a result of the actress Ashika Gogna and another who had been used as a part of a painting by the actor and scientist Stephen Armourae. Knowing her had an eye for a good thing (or what he likes) I gave this movie a go, it was a pleasant surprise that despite all its clichés it was entertaining and if cars are your thing you sure will be happy. Plenty of handbrake turns and snarling bad guys trying to crash our hero",faheemzaiz,"Jun 29, 2006"
7,"Very Cool ""Drift""","""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" stars Lucas Black and Bow Wow (grown up Lil' Bow Wow). There are no stars in ""Tokyo Drift"". Then again, the true stars are the ""rice burner"" cars racing through the streets and parking garages in Japan. None of the characters from the last ""The Fast and the Furious"" sequel made the trip to Tokyo. So for Director Justin Lin, he has a formulaic story by Chris Morgan populated with attractive heroes and villains, fast cars, and hot women in a very polished package. Here Lin and Morgan use the exotic locale to highlight the underground extreme sports culture of drifting in Japan. Lin and Morgan also provide insight into modern Japanese culture itselfunexpected and provocative. In a stylish signature scene Japanese young people at night stand along the winding downhill road of the climactic race, send and receive video camera images from each other via their cell phones. Brilliant. Director Lin effectively tells his story through captivating imagery.Shawn Boswell (Lucas Black) is a 17 year-old constantly in trouble for racing muscle cars at school. As the movie opens, his latest run in with the law could land him in jail as an adult. Instead his mother negotiates to have Shawn live with his father in Tokyo. His Dad, Major Boswell (a good Brian Goodman) tells Shawn the house rule is ""No racing"". Shawn attends a rigid Japanese school with the mandatory uniform. It is all very high tech, wireless laptops in the classroom. Every kid has an iPod. Shawn hooks up hipster Twinkie (Bow Wow), who introduces him to the nocturnal world of drifting. Shawn would like to hook up with the beautiful Neela (Nathalie Kelly), but she is with DK (Drift King played by Brian Tee). Shawn loses a race in an inept display to DK. However, in the process Shawn gains a mentor and friend in Han (Sung Kang). Han is DK's business partner. DK's uncle Kamata (Sonny Chiba) is Yakuza. DK is someone not to mess with.From the totally ignorant and fascinated perspective, this is a simplistic take on 'drifting'. You have lightweight high torque cars capable of 130 mph with soft tires for turns. In drifting the driver accelerates the turn with the parking brake engaged. It's kind of like self imposed chaos. You are in control when you are totally out of control. Though DK is the Drift King, Han is the Zen master of drifting. Han confides in Shawn ""It's all about trust and character."" Sung Kang has a presence and ease as Han. Han tells Shawn during his training that he is going to have to figure it out for himself by doing, ""There is no 'wax on, wax off'."" Justin Lin captures the adrenaline rush of extreme speed, and the amazing impassion of the drivers. Lin also paints a fascinating picture of this drift culture metaphor. The Japanese kids during the day wear their pressed uniforms, and attend their classes without question. All is ordered and structured. At the drift races, the girls wear their pimped out Britney Spears clothes, and the guys have their spiked out hair and tatts on display. All shiny objects. Fast high tech cars. Hot girls. All rebellion. Here Lin is all style, and it works. There are no real surprises in terms of story in ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"". Relative newcomer Lucas Black is charismatic and believably pulls off Shawn. Nathalie Kelley is gorgeous and charming in the card board cut-out role of Neela. And remember to stick around till the end for a surprise from Lin. ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" will not win awardsit is just very hip and very cool.",jon.h.ochiai,"Jun 25, 2006"

9,A girl's point of view,"I was fortunate enough to see an advance screening of the film last night. I'm not usually one to seek out action films but this one seemed different. First of all, the setting was intriguing. Secondly, trailer made it out to be a fun summer flick. And guess what? It delivers. I would strongly recommend this movie to be seen in a theater as opposed to DVD for one huge reason: the audience. I can't remember the last time I was in a movie theater laughing, cheering, and gasping with everyone else. That environment is what these movies are made for. I loved the first fifteen minutes of the film. From the creepy pep rally to the metal detectors, the film was able to slip a little social commentary. The first race in the construction site was not only amazing but a great comment on capitalism. Even if the rest of the film doesn't quite live up to the beginning it doesn't matter. The film flows effortlessly and what would have been contrived just feels real. I know these films get all the feminists all up in arms but hey, beautiful girls exist in this world and the way it's shot it never feels exploitive. Enough of the politics. Grab a few friends and try to watch it with a sellout crowd. You won't be disappointed.",allywhoops,"Jun 14, 2006"
6,Good racing sequences get lost in a movie with too much talk and similarities to other films.,"High school kid who gets caught racing one time to many is sent off to Tokyo to live with his father. There he finds himself mixed up in the Japanese underworld and racing once more in the ""drifting"" style.This movie has great car sequences, some good characters, some nice lines of dialog and by all rights it should have worked but the film frequently loses sight of whats going on its own world and so we're left to twiddle our thumbs. After a good set up to the story the action moves to Japan. Our hero's dad lays down the law he's to go to school and not race. After an initial run in about staying out late the film jettisons the notion that anyone is in school or that the kid has a curfew and concentrates on the characters and the romance. This would be fine, except that after 20 minutes of set up there really isn't any sort of racing for about 40 minutes (I know I checked my watch). From that point on the film shoots to its conclusion in a rapid and entertaining fashion. Unfortunately the the damage is done and you're not as fully engaged as you should be. Its not bad, hey I didn't walk out, but its not what it should have been.I have to say that the one thing that really bothered me about the movie is that the film is very similar to the Chinese film Initial D, especially in its climatic race. Actually it seemed like a mobbed up version of Initial D with violence added to the story of racing. Its not fatal, but if they wanted to remake that film why change so much of the story?Worth a look on video or cable. Not worth 10 bucks in theaters.",dbborroughs,"Jun 25, 2006"
3,Cinematic Noise,"The third film of The Fast and the Furious was cinematic noise. It was just engines revving and an obnoxious soundtrack that was used to tie together a flimsy plot and generally unlikable characters. It was a sequel that did not feature any of the previous actors (except for a cameo at the end) and could have easily been a straight-to-DVD film with little connection to the original. It was properly due to the film being shot in Japan that forced it to be a cinematic release. The filmmakers were even able to find a lead that was less charisma and acting ability as Vin Diesel and Paul Walker.The Tokyo nightscape was nice and there was some decent race sequences, but it not enough to redeem Tokyo Drift. It's amazing to think that Justin Lin and Chris Morgan were able to turn The Fast and the Furious into the juggernaut it became.",freemantle_uk,"Jun 17, 2021"

7,Pleasantly surprised!,"Okay, first off. I can understand why the F&F series have such low ratings on IMDb. They're basically are dumb-as-dirt action/racing movies whose only sole reason is for all the cool cars and great racing scenes. Being that I wasn't expecting ""The Godfather"" I had to say I enjoyed both F&F and 2F2F.But I had NO expectations for 'Tokyo Drift'. I thought they can't get Vin Diesel or Paul Walker for #3 and they want to make more money so let's add some mildly-recognizable teen actors and everything should be okay. Basically that's why the film did only half of the second at the BO.Even though my expectations were near the floor, I rented it last weekend and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. First of all, the world and the racing style of the Third movie is way more interesting than either one or two. I enjoyed the cast of characters in this movie more than the second, all for except the female lead.And the racing...WOW! If you ain't a racing buff like I ain't, then you'll probably not have heard about drifting. I would never do it but DAYMN! Does it kick ass! The cars were awesome and the action scenes were incredible, especially the Final Racing scene that pairs the hero and the villain against each other on a mountain course that only can be described as s#!t-inducing (maybe it's not a more but it's the best to describe it) The film had its weak spots here and there and the dialouge could be considered groan-inducing, but if you lower your expectations and just go for the racing then I promise you will not be disappointed. 8/10 p.s.: I also like the surprise apparance of one of the Main characters from the first. I won't say who it is, but you'll like it.",rayato,"Sep 25, 2006"
1,I hated it,No content,arnieiam,"May 9, 2011"
No rating,not a good movie at all,"This movie was horrible. The acting was laughable. The story was completely unbelievable. I can't stop watching. I don't know why. First off, I liked the first one even though it was a remake of Point Break. Maybe because I think Vin is cool. So I will say that the best part of the movie is the last five minutes. I think it's a Road Runner that he's driving. Anyway it's beautiful. But......., why are there so many car collisions without any damage to the cars. You shouldn't have to watch closely to see it. Also, ""DK"" keeps walking around with his chin down looking up at everyone giving them the evil eye almost like he's auditioning for a Manson video. Good way to get that big nose broken. Most of all, I'm assuming that both cars in the final race down the mountain have at least similar qualities under the hood. How much more does that mustang weigh than that little rice rocket. Also, DK keeps trying to force him off the road. That mustang would rip through that other car like it was tin foil. One thing this movie does have is enough eye candy to pacify anyone who has the yellow fever. It's actually almost enough to make me move to Japan. In summary, I don't like this movie but I can't stop watching it.",crutch321,"May 9, 2007"

7,"More enjoyable, but still not better than the original, but not the worst.","Following the box-office financial success of 2 Fast 2 Furious, another sequel was already planned for a release in the summer of 2006. So now I move on to the third film, but is chronologically the sixth film in the series as it is the film to take place before Furious 7, ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"".I won't explain the whole plot, but here is a quick summary: A teenager named Sean Boswell becomes a major competitor in the world of drift racing after moving in with his father in Tokyo to avoid a jail sentence in America.The story is a little bit incoherent, but this is ""The Fast and the Furious"", so I will keep this review very short.Needless to say, I love ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"". It has a great story, great action, a good musical score and darn good performances from the cast.The action is really top-notch. The car chases was very intense and much reckless this time around because this had some reckless behavior in this film, so this is why the movies have a PG-13 rating. This film did have a scene where a character named Han-Seoul Oh dies in a car crash, which we see again in the later two films, ""Fast and Furious 6"", which was released in 2013 and ""Furious 7"" in 2015. But in the sixth film, it was revealed that Owen Shaw's brother, Deckard Shaw, killed him and blew up his car. That was just sad and a little scary to see.The car chase at the beginning of the film was a little disturbing to watch because after the two boys race each other over a girl, they are all shown with blood on their faces. Han is also shown with blood on his face, but that doesn't stop me from liking or reviewing this movie.The acting is really great. Lucas Black plays the role of Sean Boswell, the main character, and Black would play the part of Sean Boswell in the seventh film in the film franchise, Furious 7. Bow Wow plays the role of Twinkie and he does an okay performance, but he is also in the seventh film using archival footage.Sung Kang plays the role of Han Seoul-Oh and he would play that role for the next three films in the franchise. He does an incredible job with the dialog written for him.Nathalie Kelley plays the role of Neela, who is Takashi's boyfriend, but has romantic feelings for Lucas Black's character and she does a darn good job in her performance. Brian Tee as Takashi / Drift King just drove me crazy. He is the perfect villain and his performance is very dark and serious. Tee as Takashi / Drift King just really creeped me out when the first scene with him shows.The only character to return from the previous entry, which was the first film, titled The Fast and the Furious, which was released in June of 2001 is Dominic Toretto, played by Vin Diesel as he agreed to make a cameo in the film in exchange for Universal's ownership to the rights to his Chronices of Riddick franchise and character, in lieu of financial payment. The musical score composed by Brian Tyler is just amazing and he would compose music for the fourth film, titled Fast & Furious, the fifth film, titled Fast Five and the seventh installment, which is just titled Furious 7. He blends the musical instruments together in this spectacular musical score.The direction by Justin Lin was bad but I really liked it and the script was written by Christopher Morgan and he really does an incredible job with an amazing dialog and is very cool.Overall, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is as good if not better than the first film, while there are some major flaws, it is still enjoyable and I still think this is watchable. For people who liked the first two and hated this one, watch it again and you will find a darn good story.",joshuadrake-91275,"Sep 23, 2015"
5,Too much of a departure,"This film takes place in a completely different setting and has different characters from the rest of the series, although it is shoehorned into the continuity later. With all due respect to the main actor, he was clearly far too old to play a convincing high schooler. The cars and racing were cool, for sure, but the whole time I just wondering about the original characters.",briancham1994,"Jun 1, 2020"
9,"Glossy, exciting bubblegum for the eyes and brain","The third installment in ""The Fast and the Furious"" series is possibly the best so far and was a pleasant surprise. I went into this film with low expectations but was genuinely thrilled by the film. As a devoted petrol-head, it doesn't take too much to start my heart pounding and the sight of the automotive pornography portrayed here certainly did the trick.Lucas Black takes over from Paul Walker as the lead in this high-octane thrill ride. Black's portrayal of car-fanatic Sean Boswell is spot-on. Scrumptious Nathalie Kelley is the female interest in this film while the bad guy is played by Brian Tee. The cast also contains Brian Goodman as Black's father, Sung Kang as Han, and Bow Wow as Twinkie. While most of the cast made me feel positively ancient, I still found the film involving and high-gloss entertainment.The numerous effects are beautiful, the Japanese scenery and backdrop is awesome and the whole film looks polished.I personally can't wait for the fourth installment, especially given the rumours of Vin Diesel's interest in it! 9 out of 10. An almost perfect sequel and worth viewing just to see the cars.",DVD_Connoisseur,"Aug 18, 2007"
7,Drifting into a Side Story: A Review of The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, released in 2006 (but still very watchable in 2025!), Like I said in my previous review for 2 Fast 2 Furious, this one also feels less like a direct sequel and more like a high-octane DLC or spin-off to the first two films. While it doesn't quite reach the heights of The Fast and the Furious or 2 Fast 2 Furious, it still manages to deliver a fun, albeit flawed, experience that car enthusiasts will likely enjoy.This installment shifts gears, leaving the familiar faces behind and introducing us to Sean Boswell, a troubled teen with a penchant for street racing. We get a fleeting glimpse of his life in America before he's shipped off to Tokyo to live with his estranged father. Here's one of the biggest drawbacks: Sean's backstory feels rushed and underdeveloped. His motivations beyond the need to escape trouble aren't fully explored. The absence of any real delving into his relationship with either his mother or father feels like a missed opportunity for emotional resonance, leaving them as mere plot devices rather than fully fleshed-out characters.The same can be said for the primary antagonist, DK, the ""Drift King"". While his scenes are effectively antagonistic, the movie glosses over his character beyond his rivalry with Sean and his connection to his mob-boss uncle. We barely scratch the surface of what drives him or his position in the Tokyo underworld, making him feel like a fairly one-dimensional villain. I think with more character development on DK and Sean's family, this would have been a much better movieDespite these shortcomings in character development, Tokyo Drift shines in other areas. The introduction of Han, with his effortlessly cool demeanor and laid-back wisdom, is a definite highlight. He quickly became a fan favorite for a reason, and his presence elevates the film. Neela, Sean's love interest, also provides a strong and engaging personality. She adds a layer of complexity to the story rather than just being a damsel in distress.Visually, Tokyo Drift is a treat. The detailed model cars, a reflection of the drift scene in Japan, are fantastic, and the vibrant soundtrack perfectly complements the fast-paced driving sequences. The film captures the neon-drenched, bustling atmosphere of Tokyo, creating an immersive and aesthetically pleasing experience. The drift sequences are exciting and entertaining, even if they don't always push the limits of reality. I think the cinematography and editing is quite good here.Overall, Tokyo Drift is a decent entry in the Fast & Furious franchise and is an enjoyable experience. It's a step down in terms of character development from its predecessors and feels more like a side story than a direct continuation, but It still delivers a visually engaging and entertaining ride. The Tokyo setting alone is worth the watch, and the introduction of Han makes for a memorable character. While not perfect, Tokyo Drift earns a solid 7/10, proving that even when the franchise takes a turn into a different street, it can still be enjoyable.",douglasc11,"Jan 4, 2025"

7,great cars great movie,"From the fast and the furious series, this film is one of the closest to its subject. The cast in the film, of course, does not reach the Oscar level, but not the worst either. The main character is not as charismatic and pleasant as Paul Walker, and the secondary characters, with the exception of Khan, are not as interesting as in the first two afterburners. It is quite possible to believe in the worldview and thinking of the characters. As for the plot, it looks quite logical and correct, but a little far-fetched. The combination of the mafia with street racing looks interesting, but at the same time a little strange, while watching, in principle, you don't think about it. Subplots such as the development of Lucas Black's character and Natalie Kelly's relationship are clichéd and simple. The cast in this fast and the furious film is new and it was a little unusual not to see the old people, and it's even a pity that they weren't there or they didn't participate in the film in any way. I think the fans would love that. As for the main icing on the cake for people watching this series of films, which is racing and cars, Justin Lin - the director of this film did an excellent job with this task. We see great tuned cars, and some of them are quite rare. It can be seen that they were not at all sorry for the moment with the breaking of one of the 350z, which makes us, the fans, very happy. Races are built in such a way that, from the point of view of logic and the most beneficial behavior of cars on the road, if you think about it, it's ridiculous. But despite all this, the action and beauty of drifting give you a great reason to close your eyes and just relax. And drifting in this film is the main driving technique. The film has some action, it's not hard to understand, it's a pleasure to watch because of the large number of cool and fancy cars that we never or very rarely see on our roads. He was created in order to lie down on his favorite sofa after a hard day, without loading his brain and enjoy what is happening in this film, which, in principle, he easily coped with as he should.",batyrkhanmanov,"Sep 8, 2022"

7,Best races and actually car focused,"The movie that initially was just a one-off that doesn't have any relation to the other two got the best car chase scenes and still is the most car-centric movie of the franchise. From the first second the music hits differently and then the racing immediately shows this is already way better than the 2nd part. It has conviction and heart to it that even some of the wacky themes, acting etc can be overlooked. It really makes no sense why the main character and everyone around him act as they do and why that actor was even chosen to be a 17-year-old when he doesn't even look young enough to be his actual age at the time. But the music and the races, the focus given on the drifting etc sweeps away everything else for the viewer. It's also wild that the character of Han and the director Justin Lin turned out to be kind of central figures in the future of the franchise. This is where the potential for the franchise really opened up even if it feels like a one-off.",Jithindurden,"Apr 20, 2023"
6,Main character ruins the movie,"Great cars and chase scenes in this movie. Based in Tokyo it made the perfect setting for a movie like this. So everything is great and this should easily be 9/10 movie but one thing and one thing only ruins this movie completely..... the main actor. How can the directors pick the most unlikable actor when everything else was spot on. I get the character in the movie is supposed to be some annoying juvenile but there were probably hundreds of other actors that would have played this role a million times better, even ones that are not overly famous. For example...Sean Faris (main actor from 'never back down') would have been perfect. But even Borat would have done a better job than the current actor. Completely missed opportunity for potentially one of the best films in this franchise.",Haris-Khan-72702,"Nov 16, 2023"

I mean I'm sure Bow Wow with all his talent from ""All That"" and ""Like Mike"" was the best choice, but considering the role it doesn't really matter. And of course a main stream pop culture soundtrack to keep the pace of the movie. It couldn't possibly have added more creativity to the project right? Most people enjoy these films for the aforementioned things, oh and did I mention the enjoyably simplistic plot to boot? What's not to like? With that said, in all seriousness, I can't rate crap higher than I already have, otherwise I'd be insulting film makers who actually strive to make a movie instead of an ninety minute music video.",gigan-92,"Jul 4, 2011"
8,"Girls, fast cars, and MC Hammer","Loved the film. Finally a summer movie that lives up to its worth. The first 15 minutes of the movie is the tightest i've ever seen. It just bowled over all the boring parts and keeps moving. The first race is the best I've ever seen. And just when I think that's it the second one tops it. The setting of Tokyo was a great choice and fresh. I didn't know MC Hammer owns that city. Sonny Chiba was cool but this Sung Kang guy is a stud. Can't wait to see him in other films. Oh yeah, the third chase gets even better and unlike other films, the last one actually lives up to its worth. Now I have a film to watch for the rest of the summer after I get disappointed by all the poser summer films out there.",fallleeguys,"Jun 14, 2006"
6,"It's okay, but far from great.","If it wasn't for this movie being incorporated into the franchises overall story I think I might be less enthusiastic about it. Because other than the character of Han and a few good races there's not a lot I like about Tokyo Drift. Sure it's easy to just say this movie sucks because it lacks most of are favorite characters, and I'd be hard-pressed to disagree with that. But even this movies story is kinda lame. I know people praise this movie for really giving you a feel for the culture, but I'm not a car guy so that doesn't really matter to me.What matters to me when I watch a F&F movie is great, exciting action/racing scenes and a half decent story. I know it's F&F so asking for an elaborate story is comical to say the least. But Tokyo Drifts story is really hindered by that fact that 90% of the characters are in high school. So the result is a movie that feels smaller than the ones that came before it, and with far less stakes for it's characters than the ones that come after it. All in all if you stack it up against some of the others it doesn't compare, but as a standalone movie it's alright.",joshua-c-s-1996,"Mar 4, 2018"

Lin gets noticed by making one of the best films on teenage disillusionment I've seen in recent times and then he has to go and make two complete stinkers. I didn't think that he could possibly stoop any lower than Annapolis, but I was proved wrong. Tokyo Drift could possibly be the worst idea for a film that I've ever seen. Believe me, I'm not so naive as to think every film that gets made needs to be an award winner. There's a place for Blockbuster, tent-pole fare. But who in God's name wants to see another freaking F&F? Honestly? If you go and see this film and enjoy it. Please do us all a favor and pour nitric acid on your eyeballs.

10,Superb flick,"Greetings from Lithuania.The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) is must see to fans of the franchise. Filled with good performances (really, did i just said that?) and good story, this chapter truly delivers. Being first directing effort in the series by Justin Lin - Tokyo Drift captured what fans (and not only them) have truly wanted from the movie, an involving story, fast cars, different approach to races, interesting characters. I truly believe that Tokyo Drift is the second best chapter in the franchise after superior ""Fast Five"". It delivers on every aspect. I saw it 3 time (more than any picture in the franchise), just because this movie it first off all about something, it has true real plot, with main character we start to care. Overall, Tokyo Drift is truly great entertainment all around. It has everything that can expect from the series and more - a really involving story. Barvo, great film.",851222,"Oct 31, 2014"

1,I say nothing positive of this film in this review.,"What is it about Hollywood that makes it think that people are satisfied with a movie with all that is negative about this one? It makes no sense to me. A place known around the world as a place where movies are born that provide us with entertainment and, within that entertainment, emotional fulfillment. We follow a story that intrigues us through a lens that fits the mood and the style of the story, through the guise of actors that can portray characters that we, as the audience, see as good company for 2 hours. This movie has no story. The story of this third installment in the tinsel Fast and the Furious franchise is simply a moronic string of events that sometimes glares with a lack of knowledge in a field that it tackles. For instance, our hero, who the writer must've forgotten to equip with a personality, is in police custody for another of several seriously destructive street racing crashes, and so for the convenience of the plot, the guy is sent to live with his father, who is involved with the military, in Tokyo. Basically, because the guy committed enough serious crimes, he gets a free ticket to Tokyo.I don't know why I pressed return at all, as if I am to begin another paragraph stating how bad this movie is. Why did I do that? I say the less attention we give to movies like this, the more the probability is of studio execs realizing that it is finally less advantageous for them to make such crap. I mean, I was happy earlier on when I came to its IMDb page upon seeing it and finding that its user rating was somewhere in the 3's, where, to speak as generously as I can, it belongs, but it's crept up into the 5's. Join in the revolt! Send this movie back down the rating scale! Quickly, before some innocent film-goer looks at it and doesn't think the rating is low enough to ensure that they shouldn't risk seeing it!I wasn't fond of this film.",jzappa,"Sep 12, 2006"
No rating,Best Performance: Anything Not Moving,"The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) * (out of 4) The third film in the series has redneck teen Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) being sent to Tokyo to live with his father. Once there he gets mixed up with another high school punk who just happens to be the nephew of a powerful gangster (Sonny Chiba). The first film in this series was good and the follow-up wasn't too bad when you considered everything that it was. This third film, however, is a complete disaster from the word go and it's rather shocking that this here didn't put an end to the entire series. I'm not going to overstate something by calling this one of the worst movies ever made because it isn't. However, I'm really not sure I can say this isn't one of the dumbest movies ever to come out of Hollywood. When you look at the budget of this thing one really has to wonder where it all went because it's obvious that nothing was spent on an acting coach. This film contains some of the worst acting I've seen from any professional movie. There are moments here that are simply so bad that you can't help but want to laugh at the scene and this is especially true during the introduction to the Sean character when he picks a fight with a football jerk. There's really nothing but one bad performance after another and it really makes you wonder if perhaps the director simply didn't care because he knew no one goes to a film like this expecting ""acting."" This might be true but you have to give us something better than this. I also found the racing scenes to be quite boring and they're actually worse than what was in the second film. They lack any real imagination and I'd argue that they rarely make any sense.

6,Was a good movie,"""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" is a mixed bag of a movie. On the one hand, it delivers on the promise of high-speed racing and exciting car chases that fans of the franchise have come to expect. The drifting sequences, in particular, are impressive and visually stunning. The movie also benefits from its unique setting in Tokyo, which adds a fresh and interesting perspective to the franchise.However, the movie also suffers from a lackluster plot and forgettable characters. The story feels flat and uninspired, with a predictable and clichéd plotline that offers little in the way of surprises. The characters are also underdeveloped, with none of them being particularly memorable or interesting.The movie's lead, played by Lucas Black, is particularly bland, with little charisma or personality to speak of.

Lots and lots of the typical young actors with cheesy attitude and not even a tad of talent. How in God do they get work? Plot? Ummm... couldn't find one.

9,The Fast and the Furious reborn in Tokyo,"When I first heard about Tokyo Drift and realised that it would feature none of the original cast members, I was sure it would be a major let down that was just cashing in, so I ignored it. Eventually, I sat down to watch the movie when it arrived on Sky and I must say that I'm impressed. The film more than exceeded my low expectations and whilst it way a little bit routine in places, I had a great time watching it.Not only is this film a damn good car/action film in it's own right, it is arguably the best in the series. The new cast is great with Lucas Black heading up the roster as Sean Boswell, an American street racer who moves to Japan and becomes embroiled in the underworld Tokyo street racing scene. Black proves to be better to watch than Paul Walker was in the previous movies in the franchise because he is a better actor (which isn't saying much but still...), whilst the other characters all have chemistry on screen too, creating an authentic Japanese street racing feel. The stand out character in the movie for me though was Sung Kang as Han, easily the coolest character in the film.Justin Lin does a great job of capturing the art of drifting as well as keeping a good sense of speed and a focus on the character development. Whilst it's never going to win any Oscars, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is infinitely better than 2 Fast 2 Furious and is in some ways better than the original movie too. If Lin can continue this trend into the fourth film in 2009, I will be the first in line at the cinema to see Vin Diesel return to the franchise.If like me, you were initially put off by the lack of ties to the first two movies, give Tokyo Drift a chance and you'll probably find you'll enjoy it. Car fans should have no problems liking the subject matter (Cars and beautiful girls) and whilst it doesn't make you think a whole lot, you really can't go wrong with the 3rd effort in the popular Fast and Furious franchise. Oh and by the way, the last scene is guaranteed to make fans of the series smile, the movie is worth watching just for that.",matt19007,"May 5, 2008"
6,"2 Fast, 2 Furious ... but unfortunately 2 Much","Lucas Black takes the leading role from Paul Walker in this the third outing of the Fast & Furious series, that - unlike the previous two movies - focuses on the art of 'drifting'. Director Justin Lin does a decent enough job here, with a lot to contend with from its superb predecessors. The setting is the streets of Tokyo, Japan, as Lucas Blacks character is shipped off from the US to Japan in order to avoid jail. There he gets involved in the underworld car racing, or should I say car drifting, scene.The acting is average at best, with the relatively unknown Black doing the best he can, but clearly lacking experience. The racing scenes are, as expected, top notch, but the plot just seems silly, and it is these racing scenes that are needed to carry the film through to the end. The main problem with this film is that it really needed a stronger on screen presence, but since none of the original cast returned and all the actors are relatively unknown this was clearly lacking. Overall it was an average attempt at a movie. The action is good but the acting and plot struggle throughout, and I think personally this was significantly lacking when compared to the first two movies. Without spoiling the film, there is a nice surprise during the final couple of minutes, that added a point to my rating, but it wasn't enough. It gets an average rating of 6-10 - watchable.C><",craigy101,"Jul 4, 2006"

It is not so interesting for me to hear car engines roar, and look at extended shots of cars that are supposedly fancy. The other thing that annoys me is that I have a very hard time believing that there really is such a racing subculture in Tokyo. People dress like that in Japan! And the main characters look too out of place in a Japanese local school! I remember the first ""The Fast and the Furious"" literally blew me away with its action and passion.

7,Street racing is back with attention to drifting this time,"This is a sequel that has almost nothing to do with the previous two movies in this franchise. With that being said, this is still a pretty good sequel but that could be because I had a low expectation for this movie. And even if there is some plot holes in this story, it is still a engaging movie. This one also has some of the most entertaining race sequences, at least compared to the previous movies in this franchise. The racing scenes and chase scenes are a very well done, especially the execution of it all including the drifting. The acting in this movie isn't anything really good but the character Han Lue(Sung Kang) stood out because of his charisma and his laid back attitude. So it's cool he is going to be in the ""Fast Five"" movie in 2011. Overall the story is ridiculous like the previous two movies, but it's still a pretty entertaining and to some degree engaging. This is a movie that some car fanatics can relate with, especially fans of import cars and drifting.7.3/10",KineticSeoul,"Apr 28, 2011"

6,OK for a 3rd installment in a franchise,"Justin Lin's first foray into the fast and furious franchise is rather the odd one out in the series, as it contains none of the original cast and is out of sequence from the rest of the films. But it is an interesting and refreshing film for the franchise. New lead character Sean Boswell (Lucas Black). After getting in trouble in America is forced to move to Tokyo to live with his father. Here he gets involved with Drift racing, Yakuza and future series regular Han Seoul-Oh (Sug Kang). I know fast and furious films are things that don't get dragged down exposition and plot. But even so this film does seriously lack any sort of plot. The acting at times is atrocious, and with Lucas Black you are wishing for a quick return of Vin Diesel and Paul walker. What is unusual, but very good especially for an action film. Is the actual use of Tokyo instead of just a weird, exotic location for are fish out of water scenario. We get to see bits of Japanese culture for example in locations used such as the Pachinko parlour,or a rather humorous scene involving a sumo wrestler,and many others. Justin Lin is a decent director and his decision to use drifting as the type of racing in the film does open it up for some beautiful shots that car fanatics will love.Overall the film is dramatically awful. But the actions beats and the use of Tokyo. Make this an interesting addition to the franchise.",paulsrobinson,"May 24, 2013"

He does nothing but embarrass himself the entire movie. The idiocy that flows from him manages to draw the attention of a local hotshot, he takes him under his wing (for whatever reason, god knows), and it continues into one of the worst action/adventure movies, ever. Complete and utter disgrace to the legacy Paul Walker left to ""The Fast and the Furious"" movies.

I like him because he is the most lively character and full of responsibility. He feels real to me because i like his drifting skills and I wish one day i could be able to drift like him. I like drifting and racing parts because since i was younger i watch only racing films and i watched all fast and furious episodes. This episode impresses me with sporty and modified cars for instance, Nissan 350Z(driven by Takashi) Mazda RX-7 (driven by Han). I found this frustrating because i didn't supposed Han would die in this episode and i have no idea why in the ending of fast furious 6 they cut the scene which Han dies to put in that episode.",yeanaphirak,"Nov 18, 2015"

It can also be found on the website 1320movie (dot com) as well. It is unique in that it examines the ""Fast and Furious"" series and comments on it. Many people have issues with there not being enough ""real street racing"" within the film. In other words they are accusing the producers of faking the scene. The ironic part now is that from what I hear on the newest installment, Universal actually finally hired consultants to help them keep the film more real and less ""hollywood."" This is especially important as the automotive community in general is highly technical and will/has picked apart this series and it is joked about frequently --- As it is in the new documentary ""1320 A West Coast Story.""

I'd buy it if he made up for it with his acting but to quote someone on reddit ""has the charisma of a wet blanket"". Nor was he hot enough to be a main character in this.

1,even the cars couldn't save it,"Truly, this is one of the worst movies ever made. Being a Fast and the furious fan, and working as a car journalist, I couldn't wait the see the movie on the day of release. I heard that this part of the sequel has nothing to do with the first two, but all the hype about the film convinced me. I love tuned machines and drifting - moreover they held the first two drift championships in Hungary last month -, so the fantastically built Japanese cars pulled me in the movies. But even these drop-dead rides couldn't save my evening. I knew that Rhys Millen, two-time drift champion will be the main stunt driver, and the driving scenes will leave me amazed because of their professional execution. But there wasn't enough enjoyable action, and needless to say, the plot was horrible, rather ridiculous, and the actors were cherry, lacking any empathy. In Hungary, we had two official drift days so far, which attracted people from all over the country. A young sport, which needs months of practicing. Shaun Boswell acquired his skills in a couple of days, put a Skyline engine and transmission in a 60's Ford Mustang in one night, than after an aggressive touge battle with the bad guy, he was crowned the new drift king. How easy that was. But the filmmakers wanted a happy end.",Dzsinn,"Jul 30, 2006"

7,Fast Furious Tokyo Drift,"Let me start out by saying ""why god why did you let the second movie in this series happen"". Paul ""douchebag"" Walker's acting in both of the first two movies was on par with the acting skills of a retarded kitten on mescaline. The first movie was made by Vin Diesel alone. The second movie was dead in the water when Vin Deisel left, killed by Paul Walker, but Tyrese and Ludicrous were the nails in the coffin. Needless to say, I formed a discrimination against musicians in movies. (Mos Def in anything*) But in Tokyo Drift, Lil Bow-Wow was surprisingly good in his role as Twinkie, although several gay jokes always followed his name being said. I'm glad to say that, although Lucas Black left something to be desired, like more emotion, his southern drawl is fitting for the farm boy classic American aspect of the main character. There are a HELL of a lot of Japanese people in this movie. NOT racist, just sayin. After all, it IS Japan... If you've never seen drifting and you like cars go see this movie. When this movie comes out on DVD I will be buying it and adding it to my collection. Many people may disagree with me because of a thin plot, etc but this movie strikes a place in my heart that loves drifting. And calling Lil Bow Wow twink. The Fast and the Furious; Tokyo Drift gets: 6/10 for creativity. 3/10 for romance. 9/10 for racing sequences. 10/10 for having a 25 year old play a high schooler(Zachary Ty Bryan).total 7/10 * Coincidentally mos def does a song on the soundtrack.

10,Blew Me Away,"There is no doubt that automobile racing is becoming an obsession in many parts of the world, including Japan, it seems. Tokyo is a city full of lights and music and also a dark side, including gangsters and reckless racers, much like the untamed America of the prohibition era. Lucas Black, a rebellious Alabama teen racer, is sent to his father in Tokyo to settle down. Instead, Lucas learns the sport of ""drift racing"" from Japanese gangster youth in which racers use spinning tires and their brakes to make fast turns around the curves of parking garages and mountain roads. Those who aspire to win smiles from the foxy Japanese girls and the admiration of Japanese males have to win these drifting contests. Despite a steep learning curve, young Lucas does not disappoint in this matter. This movie has superb photography of the beautiful people and stirring landscapes of Tokyo. The exciting action and inspiring music have to be experienced to be believed. The ensemble of young men and women does a great job of providing a glimpse of this advanced culture of modern Japanese youth, overflowing with style and passion. This movie skillfully shows off modern Japan as perhaps a neglected subject of cinema. And, the well-crafted and intricate plot is full of teenage rivalry and violence, similar to an updated ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" very fascinating and passionate.",phillipstephenso,"Jun 17, 2006"

Sure, it contains a lot of car chasing and racing but overall this should have been given another title, leave out The Fast And The Furious, should just have been called Tokyo Drift. Maybe I overreact because toward the end there's a link to the franchise. And nowadays we all know that Lucas Black as Sean returns in part 7.I can understand that teenagers will love this flick due the beautiful girls in it. And car lovers are looking forward to see the old school Ford Mustang towards the end but there's nothing more to pick up here then pedal to the metal scene's. On part of the story it's all so predictable. You know it, this is just about cars and racing and the racing sequences are the series' meat. If you love gleaming cars and short skirted Asian temptresses then this is your thing. But the teaser towards the end with Vin returning makes you looking forward to entry 4.

While they had a great plot and a story well written, ""Tokyo Drift"" intended more in action scenes without much character development or interesting behaviors. Out of three American actors, Bow Wow was the only who had a decent acting-- and he's not even an actor. The Japanese cast is very professional and I'm impressed with their work. Moving the story to Japan is reasonable because it will change many aspects of the previous films, but sadly isn't enough to make the movie good. Too bad the only things that I really enjoyed about this experimentation project are the soundtrack and the racing scenes, since the cheesy dialogs and the campy characters ruined many minutes of this movie.

10,A love letter to import fans everywhere,"In my honest opinion, this movie was probably the best movie of the first Fast and Furious trilogy.It took you to Japan (a place the Otaku inside of me always wanted to go), exposed you to the flashy streets of Tokyo, showed you the mountain highways, and taught you how to drift.When I first watched this movie, I was in 9th grade, and it was absolutely brilliant, the colors were vibrant, the soundtrack was awesome, and there was this one great character called 'Han' played by Sung Kang. He was, and still is the definition of suave/cool, this guy was like the big brother you never had. He demonstrated a lot of talent, making his heartbroken character believable, and also acted as a guide to the audience, showing them the underground of drifting in Nippon.The main character in Sean (Lucas Black) was by far one of the worst actors I have ever seen. Definitely not a believable 17 year-old, not curious, and his wonky accent really tore the movie up, incredibly.Instead, I used the character Sean as a metaphor for ignorance (which the character excelled at greatly). Of course, when one goes to a different country with or without research, there is a learning curve, but it was hard for Sean to adjust because he was so set in his ways, and ultimately wound-up disrespecting many people, leading to the death of xxxxxxxxx.You could say Sean is your link, or avatar in Tokyo Drift, and just pretend you're very ignorant, and don't know how to use the internet.The actor who played Drift King Takashi did a stellar job, right up there with Han, and Morimoto was great. Lil Bow Wow gets a lot of unwarranted criticism for his character in Twinks, but he was really good at taking the pressure off of things, as a comedy relief character. Neela was a believable character, you'll love her, no doubt.The cars were absolutely amazing, my personal favorite was the Mazda RX-7 Veilside Fortune S6 13B that belonged to Han. I loved how they made areference to Initial D, by mentioning the Toyota Corolla AE86.The women are pretty in Tokyo Drift, cue some lewd joke.-.5 My only knocks on this movie were the facts that Sean Boswell was poorly written, and the actor was more wooden that a hollow oak cabinet.-.5 Although the pacing was great, keeping you interested all the way, I feel like this movie was way too short, it could have been elaborated upon, and someone shouldn't have died.FAST FURIOUS 7: The story from Tokyo Drift, the last chronological entry of the FAST series goes full-circle when the 7th movie pick-off where Tokyo Drift ended.Hopefully someone will be resurrected.Justin Lin is an absolute treat to have as director.Hopefully, James Wan (new director for F7) can provide the same level of storytelling, and explosiveness the series had with Justin Lin.Although, he is coming to a party, where everyone is already drunk.",ShockHour,"Jul 6, 2013"
6,Addicted to drifting and Japan Automotives.,"The movie is good, old-fashioned genre cinema done in a no-nonsense, straightforward style that is uncommon these days. The plot, about a troubled adolescent sent overseas to be straightened out, is completely conventional. Director Justin Lin demonstrates a talent for energetic filmmaking that was not even hinted at in his debut effort. Chris Morgan, the screenwriter, is well-versed in genre standards, providing just enough personality qualities to imprint characters in the minds of viewers. Sean Black plays a habitual screw-up who maintains his confidence and sense of humour in the face of adversity.",Mysterygeneration,"Dec 23, 2021"
2,"So fake, it's embarrassing to watch","Some juvenile delinquent kid from the States ends up in Tokyo to race the locals sums up this rather shallow movie.Everything about this movie is inauthentic. There is no culture such as the one shown in this movie in Tokyo. There aren't that many English speaking Japanese in Tokyo as shown, and one Korean punk doesn't make a Yakuza (no offense to the Koreans - they are exceptionally fine people. The no brain is the guy who made this movie).If you want to see the street racing culture of Japan, Initial D is a better movie to watch. Even the Hong Kong version of Initial D did 1000 times better job than this one.What's shown in this movie is essentially America with Asian American actors pretending to be Japanese.Pretty disappointing, and not a well formulated movie.",ebiros2,"Jul 9, 2011"
8,Car chases the right way,"I'm not going to waste my time talking character or plot, because this movie is not about that. The filmmakers were smart to keep both at a minimum and focus on what is truly the best about these films. The chases. This time I think it totally delivers. The chases are not CG video game but real and dangerous. And that's the one thing I appreciated most. Danger in chases. It was just amazing watching these cars flying down streets and seeing all the subtleties of a ton of mass in motion, not knowing if it's going to crash or get crushed. As a bonus the music rocked and the girls were hot! In the end, a well done popcorn movie. Good work.",guilltoro44,"Jun 14, 2006"
7,Fast and The Furious goes back to high school and to Tokyo.,"This is the third installment in the Fast and The Furious franchise and it takes the story back to high school where a teenager named Sean Boswell seems to have gasoline in his veins but might be a little light on the brains as he keeps challenging people to race...even with a car that isn't his, in a country he doesn't know. Sean is a Navy brat whose mom has had to move around because of his street racing and getting into trouble. After a massive crash in a new development he is given a choice, either go live with his dad in Tokyo or go to juvie.That is how we end up in Tokyo and how Sean ends up learning how to drift when he locks horns with a Yakuza mob boss' nephew. He meets and makes friends with a little hustler named Twinkie and gets on the good side of Han who becomes his mentor. We find out later thanks to a cameo by Dom himself that Han and Dom used to run together...otherwise there is no real connection to the first two films.Definitely better than the second film, there are lots of great race scenes with some pretty good street racing stunts performed by their stunt drivers. Lots of drool worthy cars for the gear heads out there and done of the shortest skirts I have ever seen inname life.Great action entry in the series with a better story than the second film (and better race scenes), but still not as good as the original film.",cgvsluis,"May 30, 2023"
2,Tokyo drift: A movie that would make every decent geisha tear her memoirs to pieces,"Is it entertainment that you're looking for? If so, DON'T watch this movie.

7,"Exactly what's expected to be a ""car drifter""","(2006)The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift
ACTION DRAMAIn order to appreciate this film, one must first like to see street racing films and alter his/her mind to not affiliate it with other ""Fast & The Furious"" films because none of the main stars are from anyone from the previous films but can be made entertaining as a film as it's own film! Story centers on rowdy American teenager whose known to drag race and always gets himself in trouble with the law but is the final straw, and he gets sent to Tokyo to live with his father to finish his schooling. Soon after he gets mixed up with another Japanese teenager whose associated with the Yakuza, Japan's equivalent of the mafia, with at the same time build rapport with another Asian person called Nam who also is attached to racing as well! The racing is not like the other races he's done on America but is introduced to 'race drifting' where the driver is driving around narrow roads and passageways like a tall building parking garage! Director Justin Lin must've seen a lot of Asian racing films such as ""Full Thottle"", ""The Legend of Speed"" and Jackie Chan's ""Thunderbolt"" to name a few where the acting is not so great but the racing scenes are the main focus and not so much on acting or story! Also interesting is that the film allows the actors to use their natural accents for there's an actress who has an Australian accent, natural Southern American accent and of course Japanese and Korean! There's some good one-liners and beautiful scenic buildings of downtown Tokyo, where the lights look great upon the reflections on the cars, and the techno pop soundtrack all works well with this film except that in terms of car crashes done on this film- it consists of stuff we had already seen before or done on previous films made before it, with the only difference that they're done on Tokyo and done on those specific models which there is nothing wrong with that too.",jordondave-28085,"Sep 25, 2023"
6,Better than the previous,"Enter the life of Shawn Boswell, a college student with a manic taste for car racing. After numerous counts of traffic offenses, his mother decides to shift him to Tokyo as a last resort to live in with his divorced dad after the last count of traffic offense could see him in jail if he was tried as an adult. However things in Tokyo didn't really change much in terms of illegal racing for Shawn except where racing is done in drifting style. Somewhat curious and somewhat enthusiastic with this new genre of racing, Shawn takes on the challenge of becoming the next Drifting King.Walking into this movie, I had not much anticipation of a great film, since it was apparent to me that even Paul Walker did not sign to this film and Lucas Black, who plays the lead role wasn't actually a familiar name in Hollywood. My hunch was about right, the film did not provide the kind of intensity I'd love to see in a racing film. However the movie itself isn't that bad on given the Hollywood special effects added to it. The real letdown of this film to me was for most part of the racing, which was done in drifting style, the cinematography captured the facial expression of the actors instead of highlighting the race which is deemed necessary if you want to exhilarate the audience. Very unlike in the first installment where we were treated with the cars being driven at dangerous speeds. But all wasn't that bad, since the movie did have it's funny moments and thrilling scenes. I especially enjoyed the first few minutes of the film before the hero was moved to Tokyo and also where Vin Diesel makes a cameo appearance at the ending.Overall the film was a lot better than the second installment which i believe was the worst in the franchise. Also a note to film goers who prefer drama based genre, really not the kind of movie u'd like to watch, since the plot was paper thin and kind of ludicrous if you really think about it.",HypercriticalHangdog,"Jun 21, 2006"

Unfortunately however, the person in charge of this movie actually knows nothing about cars and hardly any of it was actually filmed in Japan (most of it was actually done in California). Nonetheless, I really liked it, simply because the driving stunts were amazing and I'm a big fan of drifting. The cars are all a little too flashy for me, but it's to be expected when the name 'Fast and the Furious' is attached to the title, but still I really like what they did with it. People think that since it's a Fast and the Furious movie that it will such for some reason, or that it's childish. Personally, I think that's stupid on their part. Sure, the character development and the plots a little screwy at times, but in all honesty.... who really goes to see that anyway? It was even said in an article that most people go to see if for the cars and the magazine even admitted to the fact that the writer didn't even remember the names of the people in the first two.

I've seen The Fast and The Furious a number of times, along with 2 Fast 2 Furious and so far this is the movie in the series that I most enjoyed. First of all, it introduced a relatively new racing style called drifting, and it featured new actors, not the same main character in Paul Walker. I found it cool that Bow Wow was in it, though I don't think he's the best actor ever. I found it cool that most of the movie was filmed on-site in Tokyo, Japan, though a few scenes were shot in L.A. in the Japanese part of the city. I liked the plot and the storyline and nothing at all in this movie was confusing. It was all understandable, and there were never any loose strings in any part.

Here the story of petrolheads racing shiny cars around switches from the US to Tokyo, Japan adding something new to the franchise that appears to go on and on...An unknown cast doesn't help the film retain a degree of interest to the average viewer. Some of the characters are meant to be 17 years old but are several years older in reality. The only difference between Tokyo 'Drift' racing is there seems to be more twist and turn manoeuvres making frequent tyre changes necessary! I suppose it could make a good tourism video for Tokyo with its flashy streets?",tonypeacock-1,"May 11, 2023"
6,Some things work and some clearly don't,"Tokyo Drift was a great idea to do a film in a different country with a unique spin to it. The setting was great, the storyline was not bad and it had some good energy behind it. It also a nice departure from the main characters that drive the Fast and Furious franchise. A series could get stagnant after seeing the same people. Injecting some new blood and story adds flair and broadens the franchise.Tokyo Drift reminded me how important the main character is to carry the film. This is where things fall short. Lucas Black, the lead of this film, is a poor lead. From this terrible accent that is not believable to his subpar acting and mannerisms. He lacks appeal, charisma and is quite dull to watch. He is given poor support from Nathalie Kelley, the romantic interest who is dull and not interesting at all. Their on screen chemistry was weak. Brian Tee made a good villain but this was to no avail as the two main cast members do not carry this film. You end up having a somewhat lackluster film in the end. 6/10.",Kingslaay,"May 28, 2023"
6,This one finally had something,"Fast and furious 1 and 2 were one of the most awful car action films ever. Mostly the third one followed similar route but it was better in many ways.Plot was again pale, perhaps a little better than it predecessors had but still. Some action, some criminals, a non interesting love interest - all familiar from the previous films. There really is nothing to enjoy in that sense.Dialouges and characters were little better and so was acting.What makes it better was simply drifting. Now we could really enjoy some driving skill too. Some of the scenes were pretty technical and not very easy to do. Cars still looked rubbish though but the fact now our heroes and villains needed to actually do something else than drive a quarter mile made me pleased.Still - it went too far. There is no way when racing for a best place drifting would get you faster to the destination than regular driving. And the film frequently tried to convince us the other way. Drifting competitions are judged by the beauty, smoke and driving on the edge like being really close to other competitor but not by speed.But as I said at least there was something to watch not like in the first film for example where were only few boring and stupid races and nothing to enjoy at all.This one was slightly better in every way but it was far from perfect. Don't expect too much 6/10",christhjian,"Dec 30, 2011"
6,Introduction of Fast and Furious 3,"Fast and Furious 3 was filmed in Tokyo, Tokyo is the most important world-class city in Asia. It is also one of the traditional four world-class cities in the world, ranking the top four in the global city index. In addition, Tokyo is also the most livable city in the world.Sean has to leave the U. S. without going to jail for illegal racing, after that, Sean went to Japan and saw the Japanese racing culture, and there is enmity and malice between Sean and Drift King, they need to solve their problems through racing.Many famous spots in Tokyo are also introduced in the movie, my favorite scene is Sean and Drift King flicking on the streets of Shibuya, the number of people crossing the famous intersection in a single pass can reach 3,000, that is crazy.",aaaa-93149,"Nov 29, 2021"

This is definitely my favorite racing/car movie of all time. I love how the city and culture is shown in the movie. I been to Tokyo Japan a couple times and the city was right on. Who doesn't love drifting? As a race fanatic I love how the drifting was done and explained. I guarantee by the end of movie it will leave you wanting to see a second one. Compared to the regular series, this movie is all about racing. Just like the first the Fast and the Furious. That's what I loved about this movie! This movie Is By far the best out of the series! It would be a blessing if they created a sequel! 10/10 it would be a big hit!",bryanmelendez,"Apr 12, 2015"
7,Moving it to Japan made it worthwhile for me,"OK I'll concede it wasn't quite as good as the first two, but I still enjoyed this film. I felt that moving the location to Japan and introducing a new style of racing made a decent job of making the movie fresh.If it had just been another American coastal city (LA or Miami) with a bunch of regular drag races with some of the same people as the other two, it would have been a boring movie. But by having cute little Japanese girls wearing the skimpy outfits this time around, and featuring the beautiful backdrop of Tokyo (for some of the scenes anyway), and by using a fresh and totally new cast, I felt it made the movie worth one viewing.Plus I liked the cars as much or better than the cars of the first two films. The 460 HP twin turbo Nissan 350Z was an awesome machine for DK to drive in the film. I really loved the modified RX-7 with Han. Even the RX-8 was nice to look at, almost as nice to look at as the driver Neela. A lot of people made a beef about putting a Skyline engine in the old '67 Mustang, but at the same time, every single car in the film and in the street/drift racing scene has 95% of the original body/engine parts removed and/or replaced anyway, so what's the big deal with giving it a different engine? This isn't' the greatest movie ever made. But if you just want a nice 95 minute cheap thrill ride while looking at cute girls cheering on the guys driving their $60,000 turbocharged rides, it's solid entertainment.",ccaudle,"Jul 3, 2006"

The entire movie is set in Tokyo, Japan, which also offers a very different angle as did the previous two movies.This movie isn't an 'out of the world' classic, but it's extremely enjoyable, and will keep you hooked.

6,pretty decent movie,"I enjoyed this movie, it was alright and had some great moments. I don't think it was the best out of the series but it was still pretty good. I enjoyed the first 2 movies more because the plot seemed better and more realistic, it was also more entertaining.Tokyo Drift is a fun and entertaining movie but it can be somewhat boring at times. Unlike 2 fast 2 furious, this movie has no jokes and is much more serious. That kind of ruins the movie. Also, Lucas Black (Shawn Boswell) acts weird. He has very little expression and personality, he annoys me a little, and his smile is so fake. DK is also annoys me. Its because he's Asian. If this movie was films somewhere else other than Tokyo, I would have liked it more and this movie probably would have been better. I just don't like asians(not in a racist way). The acting is kinda shaky. And its cheesy how Shawn is the only white guy in the school, and Bow Wow (Twinkie) being the only black guy.The things that were great about this movie is the drift racing and the racing scenes. Thats one thing that was better than 2 fast 2 furious. Drift Racing seems cool. I also like the part near the end when Shawn decides to race DK throw that mountain path, that was sick how at the end he actually won the race. It seemed so fake how Shawn won the race because he just started learning about Drift Racing wile DK was a pro. I also like the scenes at the very end when Vin Diesel makes his cameo appearances in this movie..that was tight.great movie with its ups and downs. Go watch it!",Floated2,"Nov 22, 2008"

The plot seems to drift off most of the times, with kind of a sloppy script, even though thats not what most people, including me look for in the Fast And Furious franchise. So does it deliver with fun, thrilling, non stop racing? Yes, and in many ways it stands out as disconnected from all of the other movies in this franchise, for better or worse. Trying to pass Lucas Black of as a 17 year old teenager was kind of laughable. To enjoy this movie you have to leave all sense of realism at the door, because like in a every other FNF movie, the crashes are stupidly unrealistic. This movie provides a very memorable, and possibly my favourite character in, Han who is always munching on some snacks! Bow wow is kind of funny, although the lack of Paul Walker in this movies, really brings it down. Ultimately this movie greatly benefits from its setting in Tokyo which is a great change of scenery for the movie, and exhilarating racing scenes. This movie seems to get unnecessary hate in my opinion, even without Paul Walker, Vin Diesel etc, it isn't any more silly/ or glaring bad then the previous ones.

1,The neurons escape 2 fast,"Infumible garbage, a full-blown torture and a shame in every scene. The third part of this franchise is one of the worst movies you can suffer. Do you know those simple stories of embarrassing script that were the previous ?, because this is not even simple. There is no story, there is nothing.The thing can be tried to explain in this: a Lucas Black trying to sneak as a 17-year-old boy, gets trouble in car races. Instead of going to the jail or the juvie, he goes to Japan, where his father lives, and in their class they're all in the races, where you give him a car because he has the money, and when he breaks it, he gives him another one. There are more races and another guy who also has money left gives him wads of bills to continue trying to kill himself. His biggest rival is another kid with fantasies of greatness who, well, likes the same girl as him. All this dense and intelligent plot will settle with a race in which the winner takes the girl as a trophy. Is the same history of ""Karate Kid 2"" 20 years after (KK2 was in 1986), this time with tuned cars.And that's it, that's all. Really, there's nothing else, that's the movie. It is even surprising that you can make good the previous two.The races ?, can not be described as action scenes, are over the top of a higher level, with cars making impossible drifts thanks to a sultry CGI.What's the moral? For men: don't study, don't be smart, don't strive, don't work, life will give you everything done, money will rain from the sky, you will always be surrounded by good girls, drinking champagne for the day while playing Ludo with the baddies of your friends, and destroying $ 20000 cars up in the evenings. For women: don't study, don't be smart, don't strive, don't work, just go to the prototype man described above, you can always be the trophy with which will remain the most pouch of all; a good girl who pleases the macho men.Vomiting.",stormhawk2021,"Jul 14, 2017"

The first two were too Hollywood. This one has a new face, Sean Boswell(Played by Lucas Black), and he doesn't disappoint. When hes caught for destroying property, and street racing, he is sent to Tokyo, Japan to live with his father, who was in the military. He meets Twinkie(Played by Bow Wow) who links him into the world of underground racing, where a new form of racing called drifting (think of it as, turning..with style). Overall. I give The Fast and The Furious:Tokyo Drift a total of 10 out of 10. It made my heart beat, pulled me to the edge of my seat, and never bored me. Justin Lin is a king.",Raj9096,"Jun 22, 2006"

6,Unnecessary,"Justin Lin's bizarre choice to move the franchise to Tokyo and replace the main cast, was an unpopular and ill chosen decision that thankfully was never used again.",benjicaunce,"Nov 10, 2018"
6,Roppongi Vice.,"Honestly, I think this is the only film in the F&F series that I hadn't seen prior to this little burst of rewatches I've been doing around ""Fast X"". I wasn't looking forward to it, as it's the lowest rated film in the series, but I found it to be pretty watchable stuff.Having been involved in an accident whilst racing, Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) is sent to live with his father (Brian Goodman) in Tokyo. He struggles to fit in but makes a friend in fellow American Twinkie (Bow Wow) who introduces him to the local street racing scene. The enigmatic Han (Sung Kang) offers Sean the chance to drive his car but, unfamiliar with the drifting technique, he crashes it. Indebted to Han, Sean starts to work off his obligation, but Han's friends, particularly Takashi (Brian Tee) who has Yakuza connections, take a strong dislike to him.So, whilst 'good' is still probably a step or two beyond it, I did, as I say, find the film the be pretty watchable stuff. It's again even more low key than the original film, let alone the way the many sequels have gone. Though there's a tangential link to the Yakuza there isn't even really that much crime in this film, (ignoring the one murder for a moment) it is literally just about street racing and for not much more than pride and status. Black is alright in the lead role, but there's definitely a reason that Han would be the character to recur more often in the series going forward, even though it would require not one, but two retcon's of his death for it to really make sense (such as it does). The film also has the legendary Sonny Chiba appear as Takashi's Yakuza uncle.Even though it's missing the sorts of stunts that the series is now famous for I didn't mind my time with Tokyo Drift and whilst I can't imagine rushing back to it again anytime soon, It was a reasonable time.",southdavid,"Jun 10, 2023"
7,It's either you like it or hate it.,"Despite its flaws, I'm still enjoyed Tokyo Drift to this day and it is still one of my personal favourites from this franchise. This movie felt like it rather take it easy and simple, but sometimes, simplicity worked better than being convoluted most of the time. The action sequences are a lot better than before, especially the last race segment. There's fair share amount of hot babes, if that's one of the the things you expect from this movie, and the score are probably the best in the franchise, in my opinion. Some of the characters are one-dimensional and stereotypical though, especially the MC, the script is predictable and felt familiar at times, and the fact that this sequel is almost completely different from the other entries might throw people off.",rimuruu,"Jan 16, 2023"
4,this movie sucks,"OK, not only does it not make sense, the story is just stupid and boring.I watched the whole thing without sleeping only because I kept waiting for some good car action ... but it never came.Oh, and they smash up almost every car. It almost made me cry tears of rage ... such a waste of nice cars (not that you really get to see what they are anyway).They should've just focused on the cars.... Instead they tried a story as well and blew the whole movie. Nothing in it was enjoyable.At first I saw Bow Wow was in the movie. So naturally I thought ... dam Bow Wow is a great rapper, so this should help the movie. Instead, his character is a criminal loser, with the most stupid ride I've ever seen.Then the opening scene with the usual college kids trying to be baddass and the *good strong kid* against them. Dam ... he was supposed to be a hero but instead he gets owned ... and this is the main character I'm talking about.So then I thought, wow, so maybe he gets off to a slow start and he starts showing some skills in Tokyo. Nope. He just goes from one stuff-up to the next. And someone always ends up giving him something else to stuff up and the movie goes on and on. The whole way through I'm in disbelief and trying to keep myself from falling asleep by thinking that he will finally show some skills and own up the bad guys.Then that moment comes and he wins ... but its such an anti-climax. Not sure why. I think its because I never really saw any good skills. Or maybe its cos there was no point to the win. Or maybe its because I never really got a sense of the racing. Or maybe its because their race 'tactics' involve smashing into the opponents car. Dunno.",joshuabeattie1,"Jun 28, 2006"
10,This Sequel still Brings it!,"After I have seen and heard awful reviews, this movie was quite a surprised to me. Sure it does not feature Paul Walker or Vin Disel!? Lucas Black did a good job filled in to the main role. As we all know, Street racing and customized street car with unique painting originated in Japan, and I thought it was brilliant idea that this movie took a place in Japan. Sure it has a quite a few flows as American kid never ended up going to Japanese traditional public school. And Lucas Black's military dad never had to live in that pig stay. They do have a nice western houses for them to live either on base or near base, but never lived downtown area where 30 miles off from base... The drive sequels are great as first two movies in different way. It was such a treat to see them on street of Tokyo. And Those unknown Asian actors contributed quite a depth of characters to make this eyecady/popcorn movie more realistic. It still amazes me that The Fast and Furious movies always have been meant to guilty pleasure/pop corn movies, but it always has great and strong character developments and cultural portraits.",ballplayer270000,"Dec 25, 2008"
7,"It was a great movie, And, i'm just a girl!","Initially, I was dragged into this movie to see it with my boyfriend. It was a deal we had made. I saw one of the movies he wanted to see, and he saw one of my ""chick flicks."" I generally think that if there is a really good movie. They should make a second part TOPS. They tend to get boring after awhile. Also, I just thought, if this movie has entirely different actors, than why are they making it, at all? ANd plus, BOW WOW, of all people was in it. Whenever I think of him, he's a little boy in dreads trying to be a lot older than he should.So, the first hour seemed a little cliché. Slutty girl, ""greasy mechanic"" that's the badass of the car nation"" and the jock. The subject of why they have a RACE in the first place was cliché, it seemed like a girl movie all of it's own. ""COmpete for me, blah blah blah."" But then, it got more interesting. The son moves to Japan, sees some good looking girls, and than, comfortably, they incorporate racing.Well, I won't give it away. But, needless to say, I A GIRL liked this movie. Although dull at few parts, trying to add in some extra emotion while not needed to soften up the rough spots, I was very satisfied.If you like cars, racing, beautiful women, (Nathalie Kelley is stunning bringing the hot school girl routine OVER THE TOP)and you can stand an accent for two hours, go see it. I LOVED IT (Please, do not attempt the nifty car moves after seeing this movie. My boyfriend wanted to drift home...)",madamesamarell,"Jul 12, 2006"

8,Surprisingly good for the third in a series,"I had heard some rather negative reviews of this movie before I saw it and really expected it to be somewhat lame as Hollywood these days seems incapable of producing a series where each film can stand on it's own merit, rather milking a dead cow more often or not and producing sequels that tend to be worse than the film that preceded it.I was pleasantly surprised, however, with the overall flow and energy of this film. Very difficult to find fault with the special effects, the acting was not terrible and the relatively exotic setting made this movie good enough to stand alone from the other two.If you are a fan of either of the first two or movies about ultra fast (and expensive) cars in general Tokyo Drift is a must-see.",extremecs,"Nov 4, 2006"
6,Give it a chance...,I'm giving this a 10 because it was SO MUCH BETTER than I thought it would be. I didn't think I could get past Lucas Black's heavy accent. He toned it down to a believable one that didn't get in the way of the story.This film moves quickly and doesn't stray too long on dialog and kissy-face. (Was there any?) The folks that gave this movie a 1 out of 10 obviously didn't see and don't like the franchise and feel that they can bash a movie in 10 lines or more and feel better about it. Those people should just go watch South Park and stop whining. This movie is entertainment in the purest form. I will see it again in the theaters soon.,wilkinsd-1,"Jun 19, 2006"
3,"The Fast, the Furious and the Indifferent","What's to say. The new chapter of The Fast And The Furious series is a major disappointment.The good: Great races, beautiful cars, a beautiful picturing of Tokyo.The bad: Too few races (3-4), too much talk, embarrassing script, even more embarrassing acting and the most DUMB DUMB DUMB dialogue seen in years. Lucas Black acts like he never had stood in front of a camera before (he looks like a wounded bird), and when he talks, his voice control is dull and indolent. Who should watch this? People with hangovers, who wants no-brainer entertainment (like I did the other day, and therefore rent TOKYO DRIFT) and likes fast cars, races (the ones we get)",Austin_Powers-1,"Apr 22, 2007"
6,Probably the best entry in the franchise so far.,"Tokyo Drift feels like it's actually trying to be a normal film. There's barely any horrible CGI and the driving stunts are more impressive than ever.I remember a lot of the audience at the time being annoyed that Vin wasn't the main character. I couldn't care less. Sean is a decent protagonist and Han is the most interesting side character so far.The setting is the most interesting part, they manage to sell it as Tokyo pretty well and there's a great chase sequence in the streets.When it comes to the writing, the dialogue is laughable at times, and the tropes of the franchise are very prevalent in this one.However, the worst part about the film's story is that the writers for later films want us to believe this entry takes place in 2014. Ah, 2014, the age of flip phones and 2006 music. Yeah, nice work guys.At least it's a big step up from 2 Fast 2 Furious. Who could have predicted the trajectory of the sequels after watching this?",H4wke,"Nov 6, 2024"

I did how ever enjoyed the drifting scenes they were a lot of fun to watch but the film's effects seem a bit dated now and haven't aged very well some of the side characters are a bit annoying Han Is The best Part about the movie

Fast five is also better. Fast and Furious 6 is also better. Furious 7 is also better. But still this movie has a great story line. It also has great acting. See it. It is one of the best action movies from 2006. This is a lot better then V for vendetta that movie stinks. But this movie is so mush better. It is very fast past. See this movie. It is a great movie.

It is awesome.,jacobjohntaylor1,"Apr 19, 2017"
1,"I never thought It was going to get a worse than ""2 Fast 2 Furious"".","But from the start, it set off things with one of the worst casting ever. All the characters look super old, not even close to teenagers. Besides that, the acting and dialogue is even worse than before. Was this on purpose to make Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson look like better actors?First scene: a woman just offers herself up as a prize for a race between her boyfriend and our protagonist. Excuse me? ""I thought you loved me"", she says when the race is about the finish and it is close. WHAT?After that pathetic start, nothing gets better, which is really a hard thing to do. The plot is stupid, as the poorly presented ""troublemaker teen"" is sent to Japan with his father... only to remain the same and fall for a ""girl that he can't have"". That's it. That's the story. There are idiotic actions and reactions, that ends up involving Yakuzas(!) and cars, to the fact he likes a girl (and she likes him back for no reason other than he's a white American in Japan. Apparently the producers didn't realize Black is not Paul Walker), but they don't really add anything interesting.Absolutely atrocious.",educallejero,"Mar 25, 2019"
9,Absolutely Awesome,"If you liked either of the previous Fast and Furious movies, see this movie. If you like cars, see this movie. If you like hot girls, see this movie. I'll grant that the plot isn't super intensive, but the mix of plot intertwined with action was great. I think that the 2 Fast 2 Furious plot of 'cops and drugs' has been used a little too much, and yet that movie still had redeeming features. I don't know why there is so many people who think it wasn't worth the money. Lets face it. There are VERY few movies that have: great plots, Awesome action, and very hot chicks. I watch movies a lot and i have only seen - at most - 5 movies that have the above content. It also depends on the viewer and their preferences. If your confused about whether you want to see Tokyo Drift or not, my advice is to ignore what anybody says about it and to just go and watch it for yourself and decide whether it was or wasn't worth it.",mutated_carcass,"Jun 18, 2006"
6,"Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift - Drifting, Clichés, and a Crash Course in Japanese","Sean Boswell, the undisputed king of crashing for no reason, gets shipped off to Japan like a faulty Amazon return. The guy arrives in Tokyo with all the finesse of an American tourist in socks and sandals. His mission? Lay low. What does he do instead? Finds the underground drifting scene and immediately forgets about staying out of trouble. It's like giving a GTA player a car and expecting them to follow traffic laws.Lucas Black as Sean is that guy from your high school who thinks he's cool because he can do donuts in the parking lot, but everyone knows he's one mistake away from wrapping his car around a tree. He tries to be the main character, but let's be real: his charisma is about as strong as a dying car battery. Han Lue, the real MVP, effortlessly steals the spotlight. Whenever Han's on screen, Sean might as well be a turn signal nobody's using.Justin Lin knows how to shoot Tokyo at night-neon lights, shadowy alleys, and a constant sense of danger lurking around every corner. But the most glowing thing here isn't the city or the cars-it's the clichés. We get it all: a bargain-bin romance, neighborhood rivalries, and women circling cars like they're waiting for a discount fashion shoot. Honestly, Mario Kart has more emotional depth.Where the film really shines is on the asphalt. The drifting scenes are filmed with so much care you can practically smell the burnt rubber. Justin Lin shows Michael Bay that you don't need a thousand explosions to create adrenaline-pumping action. The drifts are tight, the engines roar, and you're glued to your seat. But let's be clear: even the best car chases can't save a plot that barely fills a sticky note.As for the villain, DK (Drift King-seriously, who approved this?), he's a walking stereotype. The guy squints menacingly like he's either plotting Sean's downfall or struggling to read small text. The yakuza subplot? As threatening as overcooked sushi. You're never actually worried about Sean, because the whole thing is as predictable as sunrise.Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift is like grabbing McDonald's at 3 a.m.: you know it won't provide much substance, but it hits the spot for now. The drifting scenes are spectacular, but everything around them is as flat as a tire with a nail in it. Watch it once, appreciate Han's chill dominance, and forget the rest.",OniFR,"Feb 5, 2025"
3,The plot is running on fumes,"Yes, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift has some cool driving in it, but the plot is running on fumes and the actors need to be flushed.

10,Great efx...great Japanese engines and great babes. Tunes are funky as hell...,"For everyone who's a car buff, especially those who love the ultimate in Japanese GT and sports cars, this is it. It don't get no better than this... Just watched it at the cinema and was bugged out cos all my friends were calling my name out loud after that. I can't believe they actually had my middle name and surname in the movie and I actually love driving fast and pretty furious. Back to the point, great soundtrack to an awesome speed movie... great special effects...great action scenes, hot honeyz... Lucas Black did great playing this role, not too ""Mega Star"" and pulled it off good. He was better in Friday Night Lights with Billy Bob Thornton... And daaaaaaang...the chicky babe in there, where has she been all this while? She has been in a few small pictures but this should hopefully help her get on to bigger screen movies. The Japanese guys did good and Yakuza play was pretty good. One of the awesome scenes was when the DRIFTED and avoided like a bizillion people around Shibuya Square in Tokyo. For those who don't know, it's busier than any of New York's intersections! I don't think I've seen that kinda rush in Shanghai during rush hour. That's 16 million people in the city alone! The of course the finale...THE RACE, THE DRIFT, THE DRAMA, THE EFFECTS AND LASTLY...THE APPEARANCE THAT GOT EVERYONE OFF THEIR BUTTS AND READY TO EXPECT FAST & FURIOUS IV.I HOPE THE SAGA NEVER ENDS...FAST & FURIOUS FOREVER.",darylboswell,"Jun 15, 2006"
7,Stupid but fun; probably unintentionally.,"While this is one of the stupidest movies ever, it was fun to watch. We ended up regularly laughing with/at the movie and everybody in my group who went to see it said they enjoyed it. When you combined this with the fact that it had some gorgeous women, it was a surprisingly fun movie. Even if you are not up to the Herculean task of suspending disbelief when watching this movie, it can be ""fun"". However, it is not, however, a ""good"" movie. While the adults playing teenagers do not even look the part, the character motivations are incomprehensible, the dialog is puerile, and many of the vehicular stunts are far-fetched, the movie is inexplicably fun to watch (with a group).",garretsr,"Jul 5, 2006"
5,like a book amongst the many on the shelf,"The Fast and the Furious,first movie, was okay. I'm not a big VD fan.Too Fast Too Furious was surprisingly very entertaining. Both Walker and his co-star did a good job. With Tokyo Drift, Walker is gone and in comes 24 year old, Lucas Black with Bow Wow (Mr. yawn-fest) The first fifteen or so minutes of this film are wild. Sean(the lead) is sent to Tokyo so that he can avoid himself getting into trouble. In Tokyo, he meets Bow Wow and they become good friends quickly to get the story to move along. Of course, there is a girl in it but never mind, just imagine a movie based on semi-entertaining drifts and soppy story lines and somewhat cheesy characters.This is not a bad film. It's just that I expected them to raise the bar. The soundtrack is decent and the music will make you tap your feet while you sit in the theater.Overall, I'd say the film is watchable if you do not expect very good actions. The villain could have been made to look cooler than what they did make him look like. The Japanese should love this film. Not the best camera-work in the film though. The sets are below average for an action packed film of this genre.Anyhow, watch it if you must. I would watch it if I read my own review for it's worth watching. That's all.",benighted2005,"Jun 20, 2006"
6,"Still entertaining, just missing things","When franchises start with a strong footing in film, it is important to keep the elements that made the first installment just as great in every shot for each future installment that comes along. This includes direction, cinematography, action, music and characters. The writing behind the sequel should really be the only thing that changes because if the writing were the same, it would just be a rehash of previous movies in the franchise. For the most part, this sequel gets a number of the components right but there are also parts of the movie that are dislodged from the past films.Starting totally fresh with an entire new cast, viewers will follow the troubled life of Sean Boswell (Lucas Black), a Southern schoolboy who loves to drive cars to their limit. He also can't cut a break with the authorities or doing well in school. After relocating several times, Sean's mother decides to send him to his father who lives in Tokyo Japan. However, Sean still can't keep his hands off a steering wheel. He ends up befriending a classmate named Twinkie (Bow Wow), who then brings him to street race where he learns a new word called ""Drifting"" - thus the title. Along with Twinkie, Sean also meets D.K. (Brian Tee), Han (Sung Kang) and Neela (Nathalie Kelley).Character wise, none of the actors are terrible but they do lack characterization and acting skills. Lucas Black can handle a Southern accent (unless that is his real voice) but displays that smirking and frowning are his only two facial expressions. Bow Wow is just a replacement for Tyrese Gibson. Neela is supposedly Australian but slips frequently in speech. Sometimes she'll sound Australian and other times like some other ethnic group. She was the weakest of the bunch - I guess this because this is her first movie role? Brian Tee was able to pull of his role with ease for his muscular physique and gangster like image. Sung Kang is the most likable actor here. His character is smooth and easy going. In some respects, you would think he should've been in the title role.As far from the last two films have come, surprisingly, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) does have a connection. It is a very small but significant connection. Chris Morgan's writing behind this installment isn't bad when it comes down to the fleshed out action scenes but again it's the characters that suffer. It's understandable that The Fast and the Furious franchise is about the cars, but audiences have to have characters to connect to. If the cast keeps changing frequently, it's going to get really tiresome.Thankfully the one thing that keeps getting more creative are the driving sequences. In other words, the ""drifting"". If it weren't for the drifting in the action sequences, there would not have been anything new to see here. Although the racing wasn't as crazy as The Fast and the Furious (2001) and 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003), the slick driving and stylish craft of drifting really helped make the racing scenes fun. Stephen F. Windon's cinematography is able to catch a lot of the nice shots of Tokyo, which is also cool. Lastly, another composer was brought in, this time Brian Tyler. Surprisingly, Tyler's score is barely prevalent in the running time. It's not that Tyler created a bad score, it's just barely there. Perhaps the finale is when it's heard the most. Other than that, the soundtrack takes over. After the last two films, score collectors are still waiting to hear some noteworthy tunes.It's an equal match to the 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) but for different reasons. It's new hook which involves ""drifting"" is cool, some of the characters stand out and it shares a connection with the last two films before it. With it however, comes weak characterizations, average acting and little emotional attachments.",breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,"Apr 13, 2014"

7,yes the acting is bad ... it's a car movie,"I don't know why this movie got a 4.7. I saw Nacho Libre last night, and aside from a few hederian gimmicks that (embarrasingly) made me laugh, I found myself asleep by the time he ""ran to the wilderness"". Nacho wasn't just dumb ... It was 100% worse than utterly boring.""Tokyo Drift"", on the other hand, had a lot to offer. Sure it was like candy ... fast cars, danger, fire, guns, women, nice street shots of Tokyo, and Sonny Chiba as a Yakuza boss... but at least it knew what it was ... a corny car movie only out entertain. Hey, I'm a guy ... what can I say. Besides that, it's Fast and Furios for goodness sake .. what were you expecting, Bullit? Nacho just tried to hard to be some clever indie movie, and frankly all those dirty-nerdy temptations from childhood were already explored in Dynamite and are now best left hidden away in the past. Nacho tried to be something. But something it was not. And with it's cast and ""pret-indie"" (my term so y'all better give me credit) look, it wasn't even an indie flick.If I had to put the two side by side in a race, my 10 bucks would be on Tokyo Drift. It's a good movie for the big screen. Wait for Nacho to come out on video, so you ""walk out of the movie"" without feeling bad about having gone to the theater.Despite the previews, there's nothing redeeming about Jack Black flexing his buttocks in those white pants.

The story wasn't to bad either thanks to some good acting from lead Lucas Black and Sung Kang. Bow Wow wasn't too bad either, contrary to the predictions of many.

When some guys make a film fusing ""Fast and Furious"" and Tokyo, I love it even more! Yes!The third film in the franchise is a significant shift, as this feels like a spin off instead of a sequel. As Sean (Lucas Boswell) avoids jail time back in the US and moves to Japan, he finds himself in the underworld of drifting. He meets new friends Twinkie (Bow Wow) and Han (Sung Kang), a potential love interest Neela (Nathalie Kelley), and some guys who he may mess up with.As a ""Fast and Furious"" film, expect what you expect: car sequences that you just love to watch and always thrill your soul. It's nice to see how Sean learns to drift, from crashing to stuff nearby until he finally learns the craft. I love how this film accurately captures the beauty Japan has to offer: the trees, the houses, the neon lights, the night skyline, everything! I like some romance in this movie, just the right amount of cheese. Haha! Drifting, a different way to race, is introduced in this film, so that's some addition.

6,One of the better movies of the franchise,"When it first came out, I was in fourth grade and knew nothing about street racing or cars in general. But my evolving fascination with automobiles led me to this franchise, and specifically to this third installment of the series. The sleek cars and high-speed chases intrigued me, and it opened up a whole new world.Yes, you heard it right. Tokyo Drift was the first Fast & Furious movie I saw on television, thanks to a DVD disc I randomly came across.Seventeen long years have passed, and my perceptions of the series as well as cinema as a whole have changed considerably, but upon revisiting, I realised I still adore this movie, primarily because it stayed true to the central theme, which was racing. Unlike other movies in this series, where varied storylines frequently come to the fore, things have been kept fairly simple here.The fact that they prioritised ""Racing"" over everything else was something I really liked, despite the film's own share of problems. Therefore, it has always been one of the better entries in the F&F franchise for me.",SoumikBanerjee1996,"Jun 10, 2023"
3,doesn't really differ from poor previous installments,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is the third installment of a series that is focused on racing and fancy cars. The film is mostly aimed at young men who expect impressive races, cool cars, simple plot, not sophisticated dialogue and lots of hot chicks. I can say that they shouldn't be disappointed as the film delivers all these requirements. Nonetheless, other viewers won't certainly like this movie because it, in fact, doesn't really differ from its poor predecessors. As one might have expected, the flick is filled with clichés and creators are not interested in widening the well-known formula of action pic. Characters are stereotypical and one-dimensional. The movie is incredibly pretentious as well as lacks any logic. You could have expected that as well. There is also huge casting mistake. Namely, our hero looks at least 8 years older. Seriously, is there anybody who believes he's 18 ? I have serious doubts. Among sparse virtues one may rate fast editing and decent cinematography. To summarize, the target audience will be pleased, others should skip the screening of this film.",manicman84,"Sep 23, 2006"
6,Tokyo drifting,"It's ok, about the same as the first movie just in a different area or place.Not that impressed but you can watch it",MB-reviewer185,"Jan 23, 2021"
6,Could do with some polishing.,"I'll say the first thing that came to mind when I was going to offer my comments/reviews on this film: The first two were obviously better. Mainly because the story lines were thought about carefully. FF3 was to me, absolute rubbish in certain parts of the film. But I think I thoroughly enjoyed most of the action with the cars and because I love Japan, it was nice to see great views of it from every aspect. (From city night life to the school life) As much as I also enjoyed see a certain someone at the very end, it actually made the ending quite pathetic. I saw no logic behind it.But nonetheless, I enjoyed this film but I'm still deciding as to whether or not I should purchase the DVD. Soundtrack is a definite must though.",vanessa-jane-c,"Jul 4, 2006"
6,"Upon the fourth viewing of this film, i realized............","This is actually a highly underrated movie. However, in order to realize this, you have to first look beyond the surface- which in essence is a 90 minute long music video. So once you've pulled that off, you can see that this is perhaps the most well made one of the franchise. Yes, it does have sub-par acting for a majority of the movie, but you don't watch these for the acting, you watch them for the cars- and it delivers in that aspect. And yes, Lucas Black's hick accent does come on a bit strong, but I later realized it helps add to the fish out of water motif throughout the movie. As I mentioned before; this is a well made film, especially in the way Justin Lin captured elements of it: it keeps your attention with eye-catching visuals, fast cars, and a wonderfully tone-setting score composed by Brian Tyler. Also, unlike the first two films in the franchise, I find this one to be highly rewatchable. So lets face the facts and view the movie for what it really is: 90 minuets of fast, furious fun.",MovieDude12,"Nov 16, 2009"
1,Forgettable,"How can I describe The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift in one word? I would have to say ""forgettable."" I'm a huge fan of the Fast and the Furious movies. I think they're awesome. I watched Tokyo Drift once on TV. I wasn't impressed. After having loved The Fast and the Furious and 2 Fast 2 Furious, I hated Tokyo Drift. After that, I really had no interest to see Tokyo Drift again. But I saw it a second time only because I was hanging out with friends and one of the guys turned it on. I didn't leave. I watched it and decided to see if it would be better a second time around. The opening to Tokyo Drift really wasn't anything special. The race was nothing great. Especially when you compare it to the first impressive race they had to start off 2 Fast 2 Furious. The protagonist we are introduced to is Sean Boswell, but there is really no immediate reason to really like him. I also guessed from the beginning of the movie that the soundtrack was going to be terrible. And oh boy was I right. This movie had one of the lamest soundtracks ever. The storyline to the movie isn't really that original or interesting. It's basically Karate Kid and Karate Kid Part II, only with racing. The writers were clearly inspired by those movies instead of the previous Fast and the Furious movies when they wrote this. There's the new guy moving to a new place and starting at a new school. He meets a girl he likes, the girl has a mean boyfriend. The mean boyfriend and main villain of the movie is D.K. D.K is a cross between Johnny Lawrence from Karate Kid and Chozen from Karate Kid Part II. Only unlike Johnny, instead of kicking the protagonist's ass and humiliating him with karate, D.K. does it in a race. Sean, our very dull hero, realizes that racing in Tokyo is a hell of a lot different. It's a different kind of racing called drifting. He is taken under someone's wing and trains. D.K., like Chozen, gives our hero a beating, gets dishonored in the movie, and even has a powerful uncle that he respects and fears. There was one interesting idea in the whole movie and that was the new way of racing. They decided to try something new with the drifting. Personally, I prefer the good old street racing from The Fast and the Furious and 2 Fast 2 Furious. But hey, they wanted to try something new with Tokyo Drift. Unfortunately, the other new things just didn't cut it. The cast of Tokyo Drift was nowhere near as good as the solid casts they had in the other Fast and the Furious movies. The villain in Tokyo Drift is a weak villain, the love interest, Nathalie Kelley was nothing special, Sung Kang was nothing special, and Bow Wow just wasn't a good casting choice. Seriously, Bow Wow? Finally, I have to get to the star of the movie, Lucas Black. Lucas Black couldn't top Paul Walker or Vin Diesel. I didn't think he was going to. How could anyone? But he was just a terrible leading man. He was dull and boring and had zero charisma. Paul Walker and Vin Diesel are certainly not dull or boring. And they both have charisma. They were able to use that charisma to make you cheer them on and root for them as you watched the movie. I don't know what they were thinking when they cast Lucas Black to play the hero. I saw this movie twice and both times were out of curiosity. The first time, I wondered what it was. The second time, I wondered if I'd like it more. The movie didn't come through. To all of you Fast and the Furious fans out there that absolutely love this franchise, skip Tokyo drift and go straight to Fast and Furious. It featured Paul Walker and Vin Diesel and that was the way it started and should have stayed. Okay, 2 Fast 2 Furious didn't have Vin Diesel. But Paul Walker did great carrying the movie and Tyrese was just fine. Tokyo Drift had no one to carry the movie or save the movie. Seeing the Fast and the Furious movies that followed Tokyo Drift only make you realize more how bad Tokyo Drift really was. If you decided to start a Fast and the Furious collection, great. But I'd leave Tokyo Drift out and focus on the other movies that have everything you could want in a movie. We definitely could have done without Tokyo Drift. It's a shame they decided to tie it in to the rest of the movies because it was unnecessary. We also could've done without Sun Kang's character Han. And just in case you're wondering, Lucas Black wasn't used for the rest of the movies. He only showed up once and for a minute in Furious 7 to help tie in Tokyo Drift. The dull Lucas Black and his character are, like Tokyo Drift, forgettable.",mercury4,"Sep 20, 2016"
9,i voted this movie 9 out of 10,"I voted this movie 9 out of 10.Tokyo Drift has so much fantastic chasing and drifting scenes with very good angle. there are so many fashion elements within the movie.and the cars,people in the movie are so colorful and fashionable with so much fantasy that is from the splendid city dark night.everything in the movie is still very fresh.none of them are over-dated at all,even when you watch it in 2014.and it has a very strong plot as well.the only reason that i did not vote the 10 is that, i don't like the major actor who i do not know his name yet. he is short,and with the face that wants to get some punches on it.",bluetimemachine,"Jan 12, 2014"
6,"Obiusly, And For Much, Better Then The Others","this picture it's the best of the three, for much the other are a incredibly crap of cinema whit that crap actor Vin Disel that make a cameo on this movie and the acting on the cameo are a crap.Now I've gone to explicate why this movie are better then the others 1-the first are a CRAP Vin Disel don't knew act, just in ''Salving the Private Rayan'' and it's just what work whit Spielberg, Vin Disel are a bad actor, very bad actor 2-the sequel, are the worst picture of this great director Jonh Singleton that should be work on his classics films not that's craps like ''2 Fast... Wherever'' or ''S... Wherever''' and whit that horrible visual effects 3- The two first movies got the same crap story and the same crap acting and the two use that horrible music call hip-hop Now this is much better whit a new and fresh screenplay whit new actors not Vin Disel or that crap actors of the sequel, the picture show a fresh show whit acts that not are bad but also are the great thing, the screenplay are fresh but are something exaggerated and don't sow that crap visual effects of the two and it's show some rock music that it's much better then that crap music of the firsts The only thing that it's bad it's that much of the music are hip-hop that that music are a CRAP and reggeton music that it's the worst music that ever has created But the rest are good until are something exaggerated",teniente91,"Jul 17, 2006"
3,Suspend all disbelief and you'll enjoy the ride,"Don't listen to anyone who tells you that this movie is ""grittier"" or ""more realistic"" than the others in the series. Unfortunately, the original film is still the most plausible, tightly-written, with the most likable characters and (even) best cast of the three. If you liked the other two, you'll probably enjoy this one. If you didn't, you should probably avoid it as there's really nothing new to see here. There's some fancy camera-work, but it is totally unrealistic on so many levels, least of all the opening sequence! However this review isn't entirely negative - while I'm the furthest thing from a petrolhead (I can't even drive!!) I enjoyed the film. It kept my attention and a smile on my face, eliciting several laughs and some emotional moments. It must also be noted that I only went to see this movie because I'm a fan of Lucas Black and it was his first leading role in a major film (I'd consider ""Friday Night Lights"" to be more of an ensemble piece). For me, all I was asking of this film was that it show me lots of Lucas and be more entertaining than ""FNL"" which it did very successfully. Lucas does a very credible job with the material he is given (and I gotta say I just love that accent). As his first big step to making the transition from child actor to leading man this movie has done the job for Lucas, and hopefully with the exposure this movie will bring him, we will be seeing much more of this very talented actor.",cheekyhobbit_nz,"Jun 15, 2006"
10,F&F 3 Rocked,"Fast and the Furious:Toyko Drift was an excellent movie. The races were interesting and the movie kept my attention the whole time. Some of the scenes of the movie had me on the edge of my seat, unlike the other 2, where I could fall asleep and miss nothing. Bow Wow did an excellent job (he actually looked like he belonged in the high school). The scenery was cool, especially the parking garage.The only draw back was that Vin Diesel only made a cameo, and the main racer was supposed to be under 18 and he looked like he was in his 30's. Other than that it rocked. The cars kicked butt (so did the paint jobs). It's a good movie to go see if you are bored out of your mind and you want to see something that will get you blood flowing.",buffyangelspikeyscoobysb,"Jun 27, 2006"
6,Doesn't quite make it,This spin-off attempts to take the series into a new territory but it doesn't quite succeed. The main issues being some miscast actors and the insane lack of coherency with the storyline.,carberav,"Jul 30, 2022"
4,expected better,"Tonight I watched the fast and the furious: Tokyo Drift.The drifting is fun to watch, but a campy plot and too much development time makes attempting to deepen an already shallow storyline seem much too overbearing. The acting, while not terrible is nothing great and the character's personalities are forced and way over the top. While this isn't a big surprise to anyone who has watched the other movies in series, the lack of well known cast members made it more apparent then usual. Plus, there is almost no police intervention in this one. even as a car drifts into a massive crowd of people and seconds later explodes, causing chaos.Apparently in Tokyo, the police don't mess with street racers because they can't catch them. Seriously, that's how it's explained.On the plus side of things, plenty of eye-candy can be found everywhere, and I'm not just talking about the cars. Japanese women are all portrayed as beautiful and stylish import girls, and their tiny vinyl skirts are just about as shiny as the finish on the cars. One thing must be said though. Japanese men are no where near as pretty as their women here. I'm sure some will disagree, but wow. Someone get those boys a mirror.Overall, it's not a dreadful film as there are some high points particularly during some racing stunts, but it's odd how young everyone is. Appparently the lead character isn't even out of high school. Right from the introduction the film generalizes what audience this movie geared towards. What makes this even dumber is how what they are doing is illegal. Bunch of kids disobeying the law and the cops could care less.It's rather mediocre for the most part and the only thing compelling me to recommend it for would be the racing, but i feel that there isn't even enough of that to balance this movie out.Pretty disappointing.",thefuzmixman,"Jun 19, 2006"

6,It's passable but not as good as the first: Would Recommend,"Directed by Justin LinStarring Lucas Black, Natallie Kelley and Sung KangPlot Overview: ​Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) always feels like an outsider, but he defines himself through his victories as a street racer. His hobby makes him unpopular with the authorities, so he goes to live with his father in Japan. Once there and even more alienated, he learns about an exciting, but dangerous, new style of the sport. The stakes are high when Sean takes on the local champion and falls for the man's girlfriend.After two very successful movie(commercially not critically), Justin Lin had a tough time trying to continue the franchise with none of the original cast members in it and I respect how good this movie is in spite of that. That doesn't make the movie 'good' however. It's a perfectly passable movie that I can see myself watching maybe every once and a while but it lacks a certain intrigue the first one contained and a neat charm the second possessed. The transition of directors in a franchise can be difficult and I understand that. I will also admit that it's better than '2 Fast 2 Furious' but that doesn't make it a very good movie. I imagine you will be entertained, and it is definitely for fans of the street racing aspects of these movies but I can't really say you'll be blown away by anything in this movie.The story isn't generally the thing you focus upon in these movies but if you do genuinely care then you'll be satisfied. It's a more grounded, race driven story that is very centered around one specific thing and sticks to that thing throughout the entire movie. The ending is actually pretty decent and I like how they stitch the franchise together.It's honestly quite hard to be the worst actor in a franchise that included Vin Disel but Lucas Black steals the only thing Disel had going for him in this franchise. I get he had no professional training but then in that case he shouldn't even be there if he possesses no ability to act. Sean's backstory isn't that interesting and he possesses no traits that make him a genuinely enticing character. Nattalie Kelley was also pretty poor as Neela and her character was pretty irrelevant. Sung Kang was good as Han and is this movies main saving grace. He's cool but you don't know WHY he is cool and that is really interesting. Bow Wow was meh as Twinkie but I can see the reason he hasn't been featured in any more movies up until this point. Brian Tee was also really weak as DK and wasn't a very good villain at all either. Brian Goodman was fine as Major Boswell.From a technical standpoint, the movie is fine. The cinematography was mostly fine and the actual race sequences were handled infinitely better than in the first two. Costume design was fine but the Set Design was really cheap, lazy and not natural.The actual action in this movie is extremely weak and the set pieces are awful. I get that wasn't the primary concern of this movie but that doesn't excuse it being weak. It is more enjoyable than '2 Fast 2 Furious' but inferior to 'The Fast and the Furious'.In conclusion, this movie is fine. It is a perfectly passable, average sequel that exists for the sake of existing. It is better than it's predecessor but inferior to the original. There is some enjoyment value to be had and I do sort of recommend it but I am blown away this movie was as successful as it was.6/10Would Recommend",EthanBJones_03,"May 10, 2017"

6,"Even in a new locale, doesn't quite get up to speed","Well, the third installment of Universal's ongoing street fantasy is out, and as reluctant as I am to say it, what's good and bad about it is pretty much the same as the first two movies.Once again it's a crime story, although it takes a little while to get to it. We meet the troubled Shaun Boswell right away and see how his expensive, dangerous hobby lands him in the middle of Japan. We see him get entangled with a wannabe Yakuza and get embroiled in Tokyo's street racing scene. And we see what will eventually become hard, over-the-edge drifting.My problem is the same as always: It simply wastes too much time. The opening high school sequence was a complete waste of time; the story should've started after the move to Tokyo, with the opening duel shown in a flashback or video. I mean, what's the point of introducing that rich jerk if he's going to be completely irrelevant for 90% of the movie? The crime plot, as always, is irrelevant; there are much easier ways to convince Shaun Boswell to learn drifting, and without any real time to spend on this arc, it felt rushed and unconvincing. The army brat should've had more screen time; look at the deleted scenes and you'll see just how he was robbed.On the plus side...there's racing. And drifting. And for once, skill actually matters more than straightaway speed. For the first time, we get a real sense of danger; misjudge a corner or trade paint at the wrong time, and you're looking at major body damage or worse. The races are far more technical than the dragstrip-and-stop-sign action we've seen from Brian O'Connor and company, and the wild stunts are more over the top than ever (six words: drifting up a parking lot ramp).One thing that deserves special mention is the way street racing is portrayed...expensive, dangerous, not a whole lot of fun, and on occasion, horribly tragic. There's no attempt to gloss over the dark side of pushing a machine way beyond its normal limits in locations not designed for racing speeds. I appreciated this dose of reality (even though I suspect it was politically motivated). It really reinforced the idea that although this was incredibly cool, no way would I ever want to do it.Good summer entertainment. Wish it could've been more, as always, but, as Boswell himself would say, ""Them's the breaks.""",dkw001,"Mar 23, 2008"
4,Worst one so far,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift brings a fresh setting to the franchise, trading the familiar street races of LA for the neon-lit streets of Tokyo. While the change in scenery adds some visual appeal, the film struggles to capture the same excitement of its predecessors.The drift-racing scenes are well-shot and provide some adrenaline, but the weak plot and lackluster characters weigh the film down. Lucas Black as the lead feels out of place, and his performance is wooden, making it hard to connect with his journey. The dialogue is often clunky, and the absence of key franchise characters leaves a void that's hard to ignore.The movie's saving grace is its depiction of Tokyo's underground car culture, which adds a unique flair. However, without much substance behind the flashy action, Tokyo Drift ends up feeling like a hollow entry in the Fast & Furious series.",Bmore-Hero,"Sep 21, 2024"
6,"So FAST it'll make your head spin, hot girls and pimped out rides makes for popcorn adrenaline","The third installment to the ""Furious"" series where new low-life street punk (Black) moves to to Toyko with a relative after a street race turned dangerous. While there he get into the world of drifting, an underground street race where the light cars drift in the wind like a feather. Although in theory I should hate this movie for bad acting, stupid story and it's over all predictability-but it evens out with nice cars and some well done racing. Not to mention a few hot girls that'll catch your eye. ""Furious"" is nothing that will leave you breathless at least for me, but the race scenes are enough to recommend if you are a fan. I am not a fan of this series and saying this is the best doesn't say too much but enough to say-watch it. Director Lin does some nice camera techniques to make it more enjoyable and seem shorter than it is. Kudos for holding Diesel off to the last minute - **1/2",EvLauster,"Sep 23, 2006"
7,Fun but immoral,"The plot wasn't bad, but it was a bit wired that Japanese people in this film are not Japanese at all. Furthermore all the Japanese are stupid in the film.It was also weird that Japanese people talk to each other in English even not many Japanese people speak English. Considering that, so many foreign students and Japanese who speak English (supposed to be really cleaver if it's true) are in a poor public high school.",JB10001,"May 6, 2020"
4,Uncharismatic,"The first true side story in the Fast & Furious saga. We leave behind both Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and instead focus on Sean Bowell (Lucas Black), an Arizona youngster, who gets into trouble with his reckless driving and gets sent to Japan to live with his father. There he yet again gets into trouble due to his need to go fast.And that's fine. On paper it'd be nice to explore other cultures and their takes on street racing. The story is also loosely tied to the overall saga with the introduction of Han (Sung Kang), who joins Brian and Dom in the following films as a part of their crew, becoming a beloved character.Unfortunately the plot and characters in this film - with the exception of Han - are as bland as rice paper. Sean as a character pales miserably next to the raw charisma of Walker and Diesel, and the fact that he's supposed to be a teenager doesn't exactly help things. (Black was in his mid-20s when filming this film. So almost a decade too old.)And even though the racing in the film is nice, like it's in all of the Fast & Furious films, it's not enough to save the film.Out of all the F&F films, this is the only one I'd say you can safely skip without losing pretty much anything.",Vartiainen,"May 9, 2020"

The only good thing about this film is the song: Teryaki Boyz - Tokyo Drift.Here are some of the reasons why you shouldn't waste your time with this awful film:1. The cast - totally untalented actors. The main character is a 17-year old teenager, but the actor was 24 (but looked at least 30). Moreover, he has a terrible cowboy accent and absolutely no talent. The only good actor is Han.2. The story line - totally ridiculous.3. Bad driving and cars compared with the other F&F films.4. Does not follow the chronological time frame of the other F&F films; it's basically a different story.Do not get me wrong, I absolutely love the other 5 F&F films (those with Paul Walker - RIP)which I recommend, but this one is just a waste of time.",raisa_od,"Dec 8, 2013"

8,Pure Adrelinin Rush .............................and More!!!! (sequel as good as the original ?),"Lets face it critics are always going to pan such films because of 2 important reasons.1)They don't like such films (ans still people will not watch the movie going by the critics, don't you'll have your own tastes) 2)Its not cool for a so called cinema lover to like such films (this is the number 1 reason for the low ratings).I say F*&k those so called Critics.THIS IS A BLOODY GOOD FILM IN ITS GENRE.Hell this movie has everything, loads of HOT CARS, dozens, maybe even more HOT WOMEN, loads of ATTITUDE, CRAZT STUNTS (which in told and even i felt are not CGI), exotic settings (filmed in LA though i was told), ONE OF THE BEST EXECUTIONS OF BACKGROUND SCORE AND SOUNDTRACKS IN RECENT HISTORY, LOADS OF FRESH FACES,and did I say hot women and hot cars.......You get my point don't you, I would have liked to say that this is a GUY FILM but once again I was shocked by how much the women loved it (check out the breakup of the ratings), however I was in a theater filled with guys and each and everyone of us gasped when we saw the bevy of hot cars and women. Half of us cracked the SHIP US TO JAPAN JOKE.The movie did have some jarring problems for me, namely .....1) WHAT THE HELL WAS BOW WOW DOING IN THIS MOVIE, do filmmakers have to deliberately insert a black guy, and black talk in every film. THIS FILM IS SET IN JAPAN FOR GODS SAKE. Its hard to digest that the Japenese will accept a white guy but accepting a black guy who wears clothes 5 sizes bigger than him and talks like that.Hell and to add to that you had a few other Japenese dressed that way too, Japenese Yakuzo and underground dressed like that hell no.AND TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY THE BLACK GUY SOLD STOLEN AND CONTRABAND GOODS. Even if black guys want to see themselves represented in all films would they want to see the stereotypical black goods peddler. At least there was no actual scene of him selling it from behind his Van and scenes of him selling and smoking dope (i think the ratings may have had something to do with that).IS RAP AND CRIME ALL THERE IS TO BLACK PEOPLE. I don't think so.And while you think of all this you forget the fact the Bow Wow cant act.2)Where is the charismatic star, forget even Vin Diesel Black cant even measure upto Paul Walker, HOWEVER THE FACT THAT HE WAS THAT YOUNG ENDED UP APPEALING TO ME.

Hell even with the Jap Engine there is no way a car with such a high Center of gravity is going to survive 2 mins into this race.4)The other irritating American influences not only do we have black guy, HELL WE HAVE A LATINA GIRL god save me.5)In one obvious promo for the Jap Telecom Companies we had people seeing the final race live on their phones and the bow-wow saying stuff like..............you guessed it.""damn!"" ""that what I'm talking bout right there"" But these are trivialities and hardly dent the overall experience.You really should check out the soundtrack and background score of the film, trust me its great AND ITS USE IN THE MOVIE IS NOTHING SHORT OF SPECTACULAR THE EASTERN INFLUENCES ARE TOTALLY REFRESHING.The acting by the Japenese cast to good, so many new faces who can act super.A bloody technical masterpiece hats of to the entire production.YOU COULD ACTUALLY FEEL THE IMPACT WHEN THE CARS HIT SOMETHING.And FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT I CAN REMEMBER A MOVIE TRIES TO BE SOMETHING MORE THAN IT IS AND SUCCEEDS.This movie really scored because of these things 1)The contrast of the underground scene with orderly and rules oriented Japenese life, brilliant.2)The drifting scene with neela with crazy soothing music,clearly in contrast with the insane driving that was needed, poetic and brilliant.3)The problem most people, even people who have been in the same society (not only a foreign country) for a long time have FITTING IN. And how sometimes you could be a Kaijin on day and one of them the other. Insightful.This movie has many more such instances but it would only serve to lengthen this already long review.A MUST WATCH MOVIE FOR GUYS AND ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO WATCH A MOVIE WITH THRILL A MINUTE SEQUENCES ................AND MORE.We were so pumped after we saw this movie we actually raced on the streets of bombay till reality caught up with us. (actually our car lost, i was not driving hehe and the cars were..................hyundais haha a santro and a diesel...yup we sure were desperate to drift hehe).+S hot women, hot cars, crazy stunts, succeeds at being more than what its supposed to be , hot women, hot cars........+/-s the father son relationship badly handled, Japenese trusting a white guy at first glance.-s Bow Wow (the worst), American power prevails in the end.

Sad to say that bow wow is doing the best job and is most believable ... that says it all. Story is thin. Didn't expect much other than that, but even in that regard, the whole concept is just way too thin and unrealistic.But - it will keep you fairly entertained for an hour or so.

5,Drifting Into Franchise Turmoil,"It's been well documented how the F&F franchise was pretty much garbage before The Rock came on to the series, and Tokyo Drift is more of the same. I had never sat through the entire runtime until now, and just as I thought, it's definitely not one of the better ones.In fact, Tokyo Drift is the second worst of the series, just in front of its predecessor, 2 Fast 2 Furious. This installment takes the series abroad, as we watch Sean Boswell played by Lucas Black, get brought back into the dangerous game of street racing and become acquainted with the technique of drifting. Boswell is supposed to be a teenager who gets sent away to live with his father in Tokyo after getting into trouble one too many times back home in Arizona. Black doesn't look young enough to be in high school, nor do I really see the need for the writers to make him in high school. Why not just make him a high school drop-out, a few years removed from a structured life, and someone looking for a place to call home. Perhaps, even refer to him as a constant ""drifter"". Poor Pun? Probably.With no sign of Paul Walker or Vin Diesel, Tokyo Drift is forced to carry on with actors who are better off served in supporting roles. Surprisingly, there isn't that one character or performance that's distractingly over-the-top like in the previous two adventures. At the same time, there's nothing all that special about any of the characters to begin with. There's certainly more of an attempt to add depth to the characters, with both the protagonist and antagonist having some serious family issues, but it's not fleshed out in an interesting way. Instead, most of it is addressed in a disappointingly cliché manner.You can tell there's something refreshing about Justin Lin's direction. He isn't repeating the same beats as the first two films in the same way that 2 Fast 2 Furious did. The decision to take it outside America and bring new cars and new characters was probably the correct choice, but it could have handled better. In the same vein, the lack of creativity in the plot is puzzling. Introducing an antagonistic uncle to Takashi who I think runs some sort of shady business was unnecessary. Not only did they refuse to really address the nature of his work but I'm not sure he added anything of value to the story, at all.Does it matter that the second and third F&F movies are poor? Not really. With where the series is now, it doesn't really matter to me that the first few films struggled to find the right tone. What's important is that they have found the right speed now. See what I did there?+New locations, cars, and action-Characters are as generic as they come-Weak villain5.4/10",ThomasDrufke,"Apr 10, 2017"

10,A Masterpiece to Expose the Cliquey Bullshit of Film Critics Everywhere.,"Tokyo Drift : Literally one of the gold standards of evidence to verify the impotence of film critics to like a film that they would not on the face of it look cool liking. A film to expose the cliquey self-pandering limp bullshit, and vaporous affected vanity of film critics everywhere. Since, actually there is plenty of multi-layered and playful reversals of expectations and subtle transgressions against types that occurs in this film. It's big, genuinely emotive, well-paced and deliciously playful, but it wasn't written to suck the cocks of film critics so of course, they don't put out. Perhaps most damningly of all, a film critic liking this film would then have to endure placing him or herself in the same row of the cinema as a 'dumb-jock' or motor-head, who could also enjoy it, albeit for perhaps somewhat altered reasons.

4,Pointless instalment in the series,"TOKYO DRIFT is the unwanted second sequel in a film franchise that seems to have absolutely zero point in existing – unless it's to get teenage boys to part with their pocket money. Each film is a stultifying excuse for flashy cars to be raced around and wrecked while attractive women in little clothing look on and cheer or boo as required. The first movie saw Vin Diesel playing a bone-headed racer in one of his worst performances; the sequel kicked him away and left wooden leading man Paul Walker to make a mess of his duties. This film does away with them both in favour of Lucas Black, a guy who I used to like when he was a child actor in '90s TV series American Gothic.Nowadays Black is all grown up and as typically handsome-but-wooden as any other actor. He seems to have lost his charisma but then all the cast of this film live in a charisma-free zone. The light story sees him packed off to Japan to curb his racing tendencies, but inevitably he runs foul of a Yakuza gang when he starts racing again. It's same old, same old, with stock supporting characters and an uninteresting cast – aside from a cameoing Sonny Chiba, still proving his worth in a fun role as a mob boss.These films are all about the races and these ones are pretty predictable. There are some interesting crashes and a few stunts here and there, but my heart wasn't really in any of them. I could enjoy the explosive chases in a film like DEATH RACE but I couldn't stop yawning as I watched the races here. They're serviceable perhaps but they're not going to set anybody's world alight. Then the film ends with a laughable twist that sets things up for yet another needless sequel. When are these guys going to give up?",Leofwine_draca,"Jul 11, 2016"

The film had great potential, especially in the beginning. It covered the cultural shock quite well and in some ways, was hoping it would expand on it. However, after about 40% in, it decided to focus more on this ""drift world.""That in itself is not a problem, but suddenly it went from creative to cliche. At this point the plot just dragged and literally nothing happens for a while until the ending sequence.A better editing definitely could've helped, I would say trim it down to around an hour and 20 to 30 mins would make this film run a lot smoother.5/10.",Luv2Spooge,"Jul 4, 2022"

3,"Some impressive fake (CGI) driving, but not much else","I'm a car guy and this movie would be worth watching if the driving were real. But much of it is not. The driving scenes are often enhanced with CGI (computer graphics) and while the special effects team did a good job, that takes the thrill out of watching it for me. So when a driver is drifting to within an inch of a concrete wall, that wall likely wasn't there in real life.Having Tokyo as a backdrop does add some interest. There aren't many US movies that spend much time in Japan. Lost in Translation was a notable exception.The rest of the movie is worse than the other two. The acting is mostly dreadful, the story isn't believable, and neither are some of the characters. If you're thrilled with fake driving and fighting over women, it might be worth a watch. If you want to see real street racing at speeds far in excess of anything in these movies, check out the (hard to find) European Ghostrider series of motorcycle street racing DVDs. There's no plot, but the action is extreme, thrilling and very real.",mikeatlarge,"Dec 9, 2006"

On the realistic factor comparing to other versions, this had a quite low factor and low in action as well. Attractiveness of the movie solely came from the cars and not the entire movie for simple sake it didn't have the good characteristics of a film. The Evo was ever attractive. It was disappointing that it couldn't turn up for the last race instead Mustang took over. Han's death was disappointing, but Return of Vin Diesel was a good sign in the end of the movie.I have seen all the version of the movie, and one thing was common: RX-7s and the Mustangs were dominating the movies. My personal suggestion is that, if there were another version, then Lancer Evo should take the upper hand of it and also some Karate+Kungfu would make it a good one next time even.",ghostbusters242,"Oct 8, 2006"

Sure I love movies with mixtures of such things but i didn't expect this one to be more engaging, exciting and at times thought provoking in terms of dealing with present reality that revolves around us.The drifting theme along with Tokyo influences makes it even more unique as comparison to the other two.

Lucas Black is a likable replacement for Paul Walker and Bow Wow does okay. Some of the Japanese actors are really good, but the real stars are the cars and boy do they look good, they go from show ponies - twink's car to awesome drift cars- Han's car.

3,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) - I Hate This New Kid, Even When He Tries to Drift!","This entry in the series isn't technically a third movie, because the movie is set after the events of the last two movies, ""Fast and Furious"" and ""Fast Five"". So you can probably say that this is more like the fifth movie, in some way. As a fan of the first ""Fast and the Furious"", and a believer that the second movie was alright, the third installment of this exciting series is the only movie in the series where I was left thinking: ""When will the torture end?"". Out of all the ideas to make a third movie in the series, they had to make this one. This movie in the series now takes place in Tokyo, where all the race car driving involves drifting. The only enjoying moments in this movie were Sung Kang's awesome performance as Hang, the cool drift scenes, the cute girlfriend, and Vin Diesel's amazing cameo at the end. That was it. Everything else was disappointing and unfaithful. Lucas Black is the new kid in Japan, and he plays one of the worst leading performances by a young actor in cinema history. He's a total, annoying idiot, with no idea of drifting, and he will never get the babes. I felt asleep throughout, and decided to ditch the movie at some parts, to do more better things than watching this. Now, I understand that the movie couldn't have Paul Walker and Vin Diesel throughout the movie, because of what the movie had to be. But I'm just saying that if Walker and Diesel were in the movie, and it was their storyline, then this movie would have been better. This can be action-packed, but it's instead unintentionally funny. I thought that this would be a bigger, better version of the series, but all it gave me was a super headache. This movie is not favorable to true cinema lovers, and disappointing for the fans of the ""Fast and the Furious"" series.

9,Underated Movies in the series - definitely one of the better ones.,"This movie seems to be one of those that people either love or hate. On the one hand, its very different to the other movies, and a lot of people dislike it.
But some of the rankings for the whole series put this in second place.The advantage Tokyo Drift has is, at its core, its a story about a boy in trouble, in a foreign place, and with little support from family.
There's not machine guns or CGI or unbelievable stunts. There's not the Rock or Vin Deisel. It's fairly realistic, and the setting in Tokyo is superb.
The main actor plays it understated, and none of the over the top charactatures we see in the other movies.
I've watched most of the movies, and while they are entertaining, the drama and plot in Tokyo drift, in addition to the amazing settign and visuals, is the one I have watched repeatedly.",info-5918,"Jul 9, 2019"

Anyways, the best part is when Sean pulls behind Vin Diesel's Plymouth and the Don Omar song starts playing, and then they begin talking.

5,A little bit lost as to what the point of this instalment was,"I'm a big fan of the Fast franchise, but I must admit I'm struggling to defend this instalment.Yes, we are introduced to Han who is a great character and gets a lot of mileage in the franchise, but that is not enough to excuse the many flaws of this film.The main character... I'm sorry but this part was woefully miscast. Lucas Black did not work in this role at all. To offer some defence, the part was bland and the character awfully written, so he had little to work with, but in any case he was not the man for the job.The story is weak. There are some decent racing sequences but aside from Han the characters are such a chore.Ultimately this film suffered from being too detached from the main franchise. I think I benefited from watching it after having seen the later instalments with Han in, so it was nice seeing his origins. Aside from this though there is little to redeem this pretty bland entry into an otherwise solid franchise.",ethanbresnett,"Mar 27, 2022"

He is going to high but he doesn't seem to be a high school student ... And don't underestimate the girls. They are beautiful and goodlooking but cars are more lovely :D.

Has all the stereotypes and clichés in the book, but for some reason I still had fun with it despite myself. Some dialogue is painful and a few scenes felt better suited for direct to video but the acting was decent enough and the car chases stood out. Out of the trilogy, I enjoyed this one the most. The ""cameo"" at the end drew some applause in the theater I saw it in, but to me it felt tacked on and more of a marketing gimmick. I liked it enough to recommend but better to catch a matinée or wait for video.",Hakkaida,"Jul 12, 2006"
4,The black sheep of the fast and furious franchise,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift was prime evidence that the franchise desperately needed a makeover. Not only did it dispose of its popular protagonist in exchange for a cheap lookalike, but also, aside from a couple cool race scenes, it's really just a huge mess. The plot simply advances because the writers need it to, there aren't any real substantial plot elements that keep the audience involved. The story itself seems just like a rehash of any classic gang feud film, and it comes as no surprise to me that the franchise was turned towards high-octane heist films. That transition was definitely for the better, because this formula quickly ran thin.Not even a quick appearance from Vin Diesel could save this film, as his appearance only served to up audience ratings before its release. It may seem like a cool little nod to the previous films, but it doesn't make me care about this new character any more than I already didn't. The film's look is extremely dated, even for 2006. It felt like a real step back from 2 Fast 2 Furious, rather than a revolutionization of the series. I wouldn't have minded Paul Walker's absence if these characters could have held their own, but sadly they just fall flat before the story can even pick up steam.This is probably my least favorite entry in the franchise, and not because Paul Walker wasn't in it. While his absence didn't help matters, the story as a whole felt very uneven and didn't flow through very well. It was pretty unbelievable at times as well, not because of the stunts, but because of the plot itself. Certain things happen just for the sake of happening, with no real substance or process shown in between. It's too convenient to be a good film, despite the stylish driving tactics. Drifting car races are the highlights of the film, but everything in between is just too pointless and shallow to make this a good film. It's a mediocre at best effort, and the weakest entry in the franchise.",ryanskywalker-87402,"Apr 22, 2017"

One, simple word. Amazing. From the first scene to the last. Still singing ""My Life be Like Ooh Aaah"" one decade after. The ""Barracuda"" song, also. The one that spells the word ""Barracuda"". Awesome. And of course the song in the parking lot, ""Fast And Furious"". The famous one. Then, the characters. 
Characters are well written. Of course they are full of clichès. It must be. It's a fast and furious one. Nathalie Kelly looks like a dream. Lucas Black is also a great main character. Bow Wow, he makes me laugh. And Sung Kang, the one playing Han, he's the real hero. So cool. James Dean of the franchise. You can easily fall in love with every character. Even the bad guys are cool. And, last but not least. The Cars. 
Changing to one driving style to another. To let the franchise fresh. Good choice. But then. Cars are so hot in this movie. From first till last race. I'm in love with drift cars. With the red Lancer, the Slylines and of course with Han's RX7. Amazing. If own a car, or a motorbike, and you love it. Well that's the movie for you. Definitely. I'm huge a fan.

3,You can find better activities than this,"I was never a fan of sport/race cars, but it's always interesting to watch high speed and thrilling race. In this movie, only two things may catch your eye - nice chicks, when they appear and good looking cars... and... that's it, folks.It could be quite a good comedy, when you can see a car breaking the speed of 1 Mach (it means velocity of sound, ~330m/s) and when camera suddenly goes to a cabin and shows the speedometer and you see ""WOW! it's whole 90 km/h"" - that's pathetic. Today's scooters can reach that speed at ease.At the final race you can see a secret Japanese ""transportation system"" used. How can people standing at one point film whole race lasting approx. 5 minutes, when cars reach speed of 200 km/h ?? A real phenomenon movie. Film director and screen writer must have been facing brain meltdown, when filming this.By the way, about FX - they totally suck, for example, if you look at the car crash (at about little more than 1h from the start of the movie) you can see a disgusting computer graphics work at it. To be straight I mean, when the 3D parts at the side of the engine are shown.In overall, a nice sci-fi movie (perhaps word ""science"" should be omitted).",Odysei,"Jul 4, 2006"
8,a cool movie that presents modern tokyo and has awesome drifting and action,"i personally LOVED this movie! and so did all my friends who watched it in the theatre with me:]As a overseas military brat, living in japan, and being half Japanese, i could really relate to the movie. Over here, drifting is definitely the cool thing to do. I don't know how popular it is in the states but here, anyone that is into cars is in love with drifting! So it was really cool to see all the action and the awesome stuff the characters did in the movie!The movie actually covers a lot of what japan really is, which makes me really happy. I don't think a lot of Americans really know what modern tokyo is really like. The girls are seriously annorexic! And the fashion is wild! A lot of girls where clothes that BARELY cover them. Short skirts, hooker style. Either that or they have some REALLY weird fashion, uber Gothic, or hair with crazy colors and weird cuts! Some of the things in the movie aren't really accurate, but overall you can see what the real japan is like in this movie! We don't carry samurai swords anymore. sorry...Even if you don't know anything about drifting, you should give this movie a shot, because there is a nice plot to it and the action sequences are amazing. It'll always have you on the edge of your seat, and cringing at every close call or gasping when there is an accident.i haven't seen the other fast and furious movies, but i loved this one and if you like action driven movies, this is the one for you!",meloncoke-1,"Jul 5, 2006"
5,Change Of Pace Doesn't Seem Too Fresh,"First,the good,the cameos,they may seem unimportant,but they're very cool and honor the past.The racing,it is a bit different,and I like how there is a lot more practical stunts than CGI.I liked that the races were part of the plot,and even though it wasn't the best,the plot did flow nicely.Some characters,like Han and Twinkie(yes that's his name)were decently acted and entertaining.The main character had a few good scenes as well.The best part is the new setting of Tokyo,it is very different and the movie does a good job of exploring the racing culture.Now,the bad,the characters,they aren't nearly as memorable as the originals,and aren't acted the best.The main character is pretty wooden,and the villain had a weak motivation and wasn't that threatening or entertaining,he was just an asshole.The action,it all feels the same,but it's still pretty good.The movie mainly suffers from being unmemorable.All in all,Tokyo Drift has good racing scenes and a nice setting,but it also has weak characters and isn't the most memorable,it probably should've been a direct to DVD movie.",jordansepticeye,"Apr 18, 2017"
10,"The best of ""Fast & Furious"" series","This movie is the best of all fast & furious series according to my view. The cinematography, the actor/actress all are great. Even the song they used are greatly matched and those songs are awesome. I want the repetition of this type of movie.",inboxreza,"Aug 17, 2020"
3,Cheese Fest!,"Where do i start? This movie is just an excuse to flaunt sexy cars and women. There is no real, believable plot. In the first half of the film, it's in too much of a rush to race and it's soooooo cheesy at the beginning when the blonde says ""The winner get's me"". OMG - i was sat in the cinema thinking - do i really have to sit through this!? But it did get better towards the end. I'll be it, I love the race's and beautiful cars (that's why i've given it 3 points) but it's not enough JUST to have that going for it.Okay, does it make sense that three of the main characters are American and one is Austrailian but it's all based in Japan? Maybe the ""army brat"" background could have been feasible for one, but i think they went a bit over the top. If you were going to cast American's as the main characters, base it in America! I hope that the producers decide that this is the last Fast and the Furious. The first two were great, it should have ended there with Paul Walker if you ask me.The ONLY thing i was really impressed with was the soundtrack.",SwampyMcDizzle,"Jul 6, 2006"

9,the fast and the furious tokyo drift,i give this movie a 9 out of 10.why?because this is one of the best movies the fast and the furious have ever made.i mean..sure..the fast and the furious and 2 fast 2 furious was better.but at least these people made an effort making us entertained! its useless if you just sit back there in your computer chair and just give people bad comments when they were the ones making an effort making this movie! don't diss people's movies when you cant even make a better one of your own!OK? god! this movie was actually good.it was outrageously action and it actually has a little bit of flavour in it. x] keep up the good work director dude!,lil_saint_izzy,"Jul 22, 2006"
5,not such a good movie,"well.. i saw the movie...i wasn't impressed... its not such a good one but the cars are great and the races was pretty good to(even if sometimes the races war too long and boring,my opinion).fans of the series will find lots to life in almost nonstop racing,lets hope that they will hear the don't try this at home:)). the other thing that i love about the movie was the soundtracks that fit great on the movie.it hasn't any known actors but u don't need celebrities to make a good movie.I'm not saying now that this is a good movie because is not.the dialogs are crappy (i wanted to reap my hair of my head every time when they start talking) and the movie doesn't have a story,but u can still watch it with some friends and have fun.i honestly think that the best Fast and Furious was the first movie.the one with Vin diesel.P.S>:if that kid in the movie its a minor that i will definitely become a pedophile:)))",elfishor,"Aug 24, 2006"
8,Good for what it stands for,"With a little bit of plot slippin and a little bit of ""NOS"" throughout ,the movie does it's main job: it entertains,it's got nice rides,nice chicks,little bit of action (not quite like it's predecessors) and makes way for a whole new generation.The acting part was ""nice"" considering the fact that the actors were all ""new"" to the very big and important big screen and the stunt-mans were great too.nice views of surroundings but could have been inserted more and the father-son relationship could have been a little bit more extended.all in all a nice-to-watch movie ,good for what it stands for.

4,"Same old, same old.","Even though at the time of the release of the first two movies I was part of the targeted audience group, I never have been impressed with any of the 'The Fast and the Furious' movies and that while I actually do enjoy cars and racing.Again, they attempted to make things a bit different again, by setting the movie in a different country and by starring new different actors in the leading roles. But really, it's just the same stuff all over again. They pretend as if the movie is all about drifting but in the end it's still a movie about street racing. A bunch of tough talking macho men hanging around with their pimped cars, not realizing what complete losers they actually are. They act as if racing and cool looking cars is all that matters in life and are even willing to put their lives at risk for it. What's even more disturbing is that in these movies always the lives of dozens of innocent bystanders also get threatened but the movie makes it seem like that's a cool thing.The whole scene like it gets portrayed in these movies is so totally ridicules and unrealistic. Why are all these nice looking girls hanging around with these guys every night in their party outfits? How do these hipsters who look like they never worked a day in their lives got all that money from for all those expensive looking cars? And why do they think that racing a car is the answer to every problem in life? Sorry, I just can't take the whole vibe of the scene and its atmosphere that the movie sends out.But no, that really isn't the biggest problem of these movies. I mean they still could really work out as hip and fun entertaining movies but yet so far the first three movies completely failed at this. It's not hard to see why; the stories are so disturbingly lacking.I think this movie even had the worst story out of three movies so far. Why even let the story take place in Tokyo in the first place? Seriously, this movie could had just as easily been set at any random American city. Just a marketing trick to make it seem as if this movie is being renewing and different from the other ones. But there also really isn't much good happening in the movie. Once you start analyzing it you see that all it is is some racing, than some hot girls again (I can't believe the amount of ass-shots in this movie. You should make a drinking game out of it) and then some more racing. This goes on and on, till the movie its end. I seriously wish there was some more substance to it and there actually was plenty of room and opportunity for that, with some of the movie its characters (the dad, the girlfriend, perhaps even with the Sonny Chiba character).The characters in this movie also form one major problem. There just isn't really likable enough and the movie is really lacking some star power behind it. Yes, believe it or not but this movie really could had uses some Vin Diesel or Paul Walker in it, as one of the main leads. I would had even gone for Tyrese but that's just because I wasn't that happy with Lucas Black, who talks like Jodie Foster and all he does is looking tough, without any acting behind it.The race sequence, what these movies are all about in the first place, just also didn't impressed me all that much. I often had a hard time figuring out what was going on because of the way it got shot and edited. I also kept on forgetting why they were racing in the first place, which was all because of its lacking and very uninteresting and unrealistic story.Really the worst out of the series so far. At least I think, cause I don't remember that much about the weak previous two.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Boba_Fett1138,"Jun 10, 2011"
10,mustang's new engine,"The engine in the mustang is not a RX-7 motor it is a 4cyc. out of a Silvia S15 this is the Japanese version of the 240SX both made by Nissan. And the motor would fit in the engine bay of the mustang. Other than that the movie was very very very good, but to all of those people out there who think drifting is easy, you are wrong, drifting is very hard a should NOT be attempted on the streets. Drifting is a motor sport which should be left on the track. this fast and the furious is the best yet, and if there are more to come i hope that the movie makers find a better way to keep the attention of the audience, because Tokyo drift was action from the start to the finish.",fireball138,"Jul 7, 2006"
3,Not the best of the lot,"Graphics were alright, but other than that it was pretty awful. Acting was pretty average, and the story line was a bit too cheesy. If I could, i would certainly go and get my money back, although I can't deny that the sound of the engines was nice to hear on the surround sound. The camera angles made the driving seem too easy, and just the whole idea of racing on the streets of Tokyo in the middle of so much traffic is just hard to swallow... Won't recommend that you go and waste the money in to watch in theaters, but it might be worth the watch on DVD if you have nothing better to do. I think i liked the second one the best out of the three F&F movies, but even that one wasn't worth paying, so you can probably guess how horrible the acting was.",Omarsolaija,"Jun 29, 2006"

3,very silly-please don't make a 4th,"The car racing scenes are all really over-the-top and down right silly. The drift racing they do would be impossible. Bama Boy, aka Sean, goes to Japan and just happens to find ""high school""(they look much older than high schoolers which is another glaring absurdity) kids into drift racing and he likes the girlfriend of the lead racer,DK. Of course, it is a set up for a final race at the end to prove who is better. This drift racing is so silly. It's like a car is gliding on ice. Then they go up this spiraling ramp to the top sideways. How silly can you get? And to make DK be involved with the mob also. When is it too much!FINAL VERDICT: Very lack luster. I loved the first movie. The second one was OK. But this was lousy.",MLDinTN,"Apr 30, 2007"
4,"A step up from it's predecessor, but this is still extremely dull stuff","The Fast and Furious franchise somewhat stalled with this third entry, which re-locates to the neon eye-candy of Japan in a desperate bid to avoid the tedium of the rest of the movie. The first sequel at least managed to keep hold of Paul Walker, who while wasn't the most gifted of actors in his tragically short career, he still had that Keanu Reeves-esque, beach-bum charm. Tokyo Drift stars Lucas Black, that rough-looking kid who was extremely impressive in Sling Blade (1996). His thick Southern drawl - rarely heard outside of an episode of The Simpsons - and goofy demeanour may make him a refreshingly different character to the meat-heads normally seen in this series, but he's just too damn convincing as a complete knuckle-head.After he lands himself in trouble totalling a car and demolishing a housing development in the process, Sean (Black) relocates to Tokyo to avoid a prison sentence, joining up with his military father. With the help of new high school friend Twinkie (Shad Moss, formerly known as Bow Wow), he finds the city's underground racing scene and quickly creates an enemy in yakuza D.K. (Brian Tee). D.K. challenges Sean to a race that involves 'drifting' - driving sideways at high speed around difficult corners. Sean is beaten, but fellow yakuza Han (Sung Kang) says he has character (thank God he told us) and invites him to join his gang to become a drift racer.It becomes a running (and unintentional) joke throughout the movie just how bad Sean is at everything he does. Han somehow sees a good driver in there, but all he seems to do is write off cars and wreak havoc. The complete charisma-void that is the film's hero is not helped by the film's awful script, and who knew there was so many Japanese men that speak English in an American accent? Nevertheless, it's a step up from 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003), and director Justin Lin infuses the action scenes with a bigger sense of reality, dragging the franchise back from the video game it was becoming. No one really gets hurt, but at least the cars get wrecked. Still, this is extremely dull stuff.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",tomgillespie2002,"Jan 11, 2015"
10,"""Shot in the arm of a dead series""","To those who've seen the previous installments of the Fast and the Furious series...welcome to the best of the bunch. Tokyo Drift actually takes what we remember from the previous two...and dumps it on its ears. The scenery, the acting...the overall story is a true step up compared to the previous movies.The story starts out in a typical American High school and introduces us to the films hero Sean. He has a lack of respect for authority and a love for speed, as shown in the accident that gets him sent to live w'his military father in Tokyo, Japan (hence the movie's name Tokyo Drift). Sean quickly learns of drift racing...or drifting as its come to be known, falls in w'the local racers and after a few learning experiences starts to gain the respect of the Japanese underground race scene. It all builds up to a great ending that outdoes anything in the previous two movies...and leaves the viewer wanting more.I am a fan of the series....I liked the original...absolutely hated the sequel(i wont even dignify it by saying its name)....and I truly loved pt. 3. Tokyo Drift is truly a shot in the arm of a dead and stale series. The locations and cars are a step up from the tired locals we've grown accustomed to in the previous installments. The storyline was a lot better done....the acting...well some people call this film the stand alone movie of the series...and it does stand alone..it can be viewed by itself or as a part of the trilogy w/very little loss to the story line, its the only film of the series to actually have some actors w'some acting chops..its the only film of the three that wasn't thrown together at the last min...and actually makes the viewer want to watch again.In short...if you haven't seen it...watch it...if u have seen it..re-watch it, Tokyo Drift actually makes you enjoy the sport of street racing...and puts back together very nicely what the previous film destroyed.",Holdenmagroyn,"Jan 27, 2008"
4,"Need for Speed the film, part 3","In 2001 The Fast and the Furious was released. Based around street racing for the most of the film and containing some bits about carjackers the film wasn't half bad. In 2003 the sequel was made. It wasn't half as good as the original. Now, in 2006, the third part is released and it is as bad as the 2nd one.In this part the story moves its background to Tokyo. The racing type goes from quarter mile to drifting, and the story is just as thin as the other two parts. It is still a film version of the Need for Speed games and I more or less expect the next part to have the racers score points by hitting police cars.It is a way to spend a bored Sunday afternoon, but nothing more than that and I wouldn't advise anyone to watch it - if you've never seen the first one I would suggest that one instead and if you have, just skip it.4 out of 10 very short skirts.",LazySod,"Aug 6, 2006"

3,Sore Thumb of the Franchise,One of the worst acted movies that's not considered a children's movie that I've ever scene. The lead actor looks like it's his first time in front of a camera and the story is equally as bad. It's unclear what the problem to be solved in the story even is. It's clear they wanted to make a feud between Boswell and DK but weren't sure how to do that so they just concocted some story about Han taking money on the side. In the other Fast and Furious movies there is at least reason for the car chases. For this movie all they want to do is show you car chases and in order to do so they make up a feeble story in order to show you endless drifting. Clearly they are hoping that the viewer is just mesmerized by the drifting otherwise I can't see what there is to enjoy otherwise. Even the love interest between Boswell and Neela is awkward. You re told pieces of her story but in the end she's only used seemingly to be a piece to be gifted to the winner of the races. No doubt a demeaning role.The only role this movie serves is to give you some more time with Han and it at least fits with the ending of Fast 6.,ThereelscoopwithKK,"May 11, 2023"

4,One Person Ruins the Whole Film,"The racing sequences and the entire concept of drifting elevate the Fast and the Furious franchise to a new level. Unfortunately, the casting of the protagonist in Tokyo Drift makes this film borderline unwatchable. Lucas Black does not look like a teenager, does not act like a teenager and is the opposite of what his character is supposed to be. Rather than a charming southern boy trying to find his way in Japan, Sean comes across as a creepy man-child too arrogant to respect those around him.I would only rewatch this film for one of two reasons: 1) To watch the epic drift race down the mountain (if only we could cut out the horrible, flip-phone huddled reactions) and 2) Han (easily one of the best characters in the entire F&F franchise). Justin Lin is better than this, which he goes on to prove with Fast Five and arguably the best episode of Community.",jace_the_film_guy,"Jul 16, 2021"

8,I love drift,"""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" is a movie bomb. A completely different plot from the first 2 films with a story set in the future. The beauty of this movie is that you could also see it without watching the saga, although you would not understand the ending, which I really liked and has a crazy soundtrack. In my opinion the film really comes to life in its second part, the first is a bit more boring, the second is spectacular. Even here the characters are introduced very well: the best for me is Han, simple but essential, with a great interpretation of Sung Kang. I also liked D. K. with a great interpretation of Brian Tee and Twinkie of Bow Bow. One character that I never fully appreciated in all the visions of this film is Neela, she never gave me anything. The protagonist Sean has convinced me a lot and I can't wait to see him with Brian and Dom. The direction of Justin Lin in my opinion exceeds that of the first two chapters with many spectacular shots and has organized the film very well. In my opinion this is (compared to the first two films) the one with the best car races. I also liked the photography a lot. The most beautiful thing about this film are the soundtracks, unforgettable and perfect for the fantastic Tokyo setting. In my opinion this film, like the whole saga, is too underrated, these films are bombs and if they are seen to have fun and see the beautiful action scenes are masterpieces, stop. I never get tired of this movie, even if I've seen it five times..

4,Catch my drift,"Despite featuring none of the stars (but for a surprise cameo at the end) from the original films, this third instalment and its modest box office success convinced Universal Pictures that there was mileage in the Fast and Furious series.Director Justin Lin re-tooled the franchise, introduced the elements and a kinetic style that would carry on when Paul Walker and Vin Diesel return for the fourth part.Tokyo Drift has the southern drawl of Lucas Black who plays Sean Boswell a troublesome teenager regularly in trouble with the police. A disastrous drag race against a rich kid is too much for his mother who sends him to Tokyo to live with his father and attend high school there even though he does not speak a word of Japanese he apparently goes to a regular school rather than some international one.Before long Sean flirts with the girlfriend of DK (the drift king) who is the nephew of the Yakuza kingpin and falls in with the underground racing scene that features the skill of drifting.Sean starts to work for the mysterious hustler Han (Sung Kang) who teaches him how to drift and he ends up challenging DK for top dog status after a tragic accident.Although largely set in Japan the film still manages to have a multi ethnic cast and an urban soundtrack that the films have become noted for. However the story is thin, there are no outlandish heists or preposterous plotting. Lucas Black is just too blank as the lead and it is no surprise that the enigmatic Sung Kang was the more intriguing actor hence why he featured in the subsequent films.Do note that a crash scene was later retconned in the closing credits of Fast & Furious 6.The film has its flaws but it is also an important chapter in the creative team of Lin and Morgan. They would continue with the Fast & Furious films, bring back the original stars and makes this into one of the most profitable modern franchises around.",Prismark10,"Jul 8, 2016"

It really feels that the Director was out of touch with the Authentecity of the script and just found warm bodies to fill the role.

The street races in particular are pretty good and is what I would consider to be Tokyo Drift's most redeeming quality.

From here the movie goes into predictable mode.The screenplay of the movie is decent but for me the movie was predictable and doesn't have anything new to offer.Acting was average and none of the character was memorable.

4,The inevitability of this franchise is nigh,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift opens with a sequence so breakneck and fast-paced it may give you whiplash. Set in sun-soaked Arizona, it opens by focusing on local boy Sean Boswell (Lucas Black), who is being teased by a typical high school jock for his ragtag vehicle while he proudly boasts a blood-red Viper. Sean is prepared to drive away after delivering a zinger, but instead nearly takes a wrench to the jock's vehicle after he throws a stone and breaks a window on Sean's car. The jock's girlfriend suggests the two settle it out in a race in a property development community where the winner, she says, will ""win me"" as their prize. Ho ho.Sean and the jock agree to the bet and endure a breathless four minute long race that is so American in what it does; everything from fast cars, to stereotyped characters, to the aching masculinity are profiled in this opening scene, which does indeed circumvent to a greater moral when the race is over and the characters are badly maimed in the hospital; these street-racing incidents are illegal for a reason and often result in serious accidents.Sean's mother cannot afford this latest escape, which has Sean's car totaled and his life in jeopardy now that he is about to be imprisoned on prior street-racing charges before he's even eighteen. As a result, she sends him to live with father, who is stationed in Tokyo and a part of the U.S. Navy. Sean meets Twinkie (Bow Wow), the only black guy to be found in Japan, who introduces him to Tokyo's underground street-racing scene which, unlike most American races, is predicated upon the vehicular art of drifting. For those unschooled, drifting a vehicle is performed on a sharp turn, which puts all the emphasize of control and handling on one particular side of the car, resulting in a tire-screeching and, if done correctly, slick method of completing a difficult turn without one losing control of the vehicle or losing too much speed in the process. I've done it with friends on a snow-covered parking lot; it's as fun and as exhilarating as it sounds.If you can't drift in Tokyo, you're worse than a loser - you're an outsider, and early in his stay, Sean meets Takashi (Brian Tee), Tokyo's well-respected Drift King, along with his girlfriend Neela (Nathalie Kelley). Sean impulsively decides to race Takashi, but because he has no conception of drifting, he loses miserably on a course made up of tight turns and many opportunities for close calls. In order to prevent embarrassment the second time around, Sean calls on street-racer Han Seoul-Oh (Sung Kang) for assistance, in order to eventually beat Takashi and avoid getting caught up in dirty underground business.The Fast and the Furious movies have taught me a lot in just three fairly breezy installments, but I would've never guessed how much could be obtained and how many problems could automatically evaporate thanks to slick vehicle tricks and street races. Enemies often turn to close friends, a laundry list of felonies are expunged off records, drug lords are stopped, mass respect is earned, nationalities come together, and globalization is achieved. I may be going too far off the deep-end with the last two, but keep in mind I have four more films to tackle, so these can be seen as early predictions of impact.The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, however, doesn't have the charisma of its predecessors, nor does it have Rob Cohen's hand for flashiness nor John Singleton's assured hand at balancing chaos. Justin Lin interjects the kind of dizzying action I was hoping these films would avoid, and the characters here feel like further developed archetypes similar to how 2 Fast 2 Furious's loud mouth character Roman Pierce (Tyrese Gibson) thrived on smart-ass comments. For all the brooding Lucas Black does here, very little emits any character development or likability (at least Paul Walker had his coolness and his wit to back him up), and Bow Wow is laughably flat as the token black character who has to teach the outsider the ways of the streets.Screenwriter Chris Morgan's decision to take the franchise in a different direction is an admirable one, but also perhaps too soon for its own good. The second film didn't focus on Vin Diesel's Dom character, nor did it really emphasis the kind of believable, common-man quality of all the racers and street-races in the first film. The inevitability of the Fast and the Furious franchise is it succeeded the first couple times because it emphasized a wee bit of plausibility in its schemes, however, monstrous box office success for an action film will always lead to sequels trying to push boundaries and up the dosage of chaos in each successor of the franchise.While Tokyo Drift doesn't get too crazy, it's still never quite as fun, especially being that the people involved in these races aren't particularly likable, and outside of a fairly strong, if unabashedly silly, opening scene, there's little merit to the third outing save for a special cameo by someone we've waited too long to see anyways.Starring: Lucas Black, Bow Wow, Brian Tee, Nathalie Kelley, and Sung Kang. Directed by: Justin Lin.",StevePulaski,"Dec 9, 2015"
8,Better than 1 and 2,"It's easy to beat 2, so that isn't saying much. However, in my mind it is even better than the first. Neither necessarily has a great storyline, though number 1 had the most likely one. However, where the first one failed, Tokyo Drift delivers.People don't go see movies like this for substance and content. They go to see cars race. Autophiles and racers go to see the tricked out cars and hear the names of their suppliers being used on the big screen. The first installment in this series used a lot a jargon unknown to non to non-racers, and to those who were in the know, the movie was a joke. Tokyo Drift gets away from all the pretenses and delivers what the truth is: few people use Nitrous Oxide, and racers drive because they love it, money or none, just to see who is the best.The cars are great. It was wonderful too see the makes and models you are used to seeing out there, instead of all these tricked out high priced rice racers. The best cars to race aren't necessarily the most expensive. The racing was more about skill than power, and that's the truth. First off the line means jack if you don't know your wheels. The racing scenes are top notch. Gone are the shaky camera angles and digitally enhanced shots of cars flying by at 140mph with nitrous in full bore. Instead, we get cool shots using cell phones, and up close angles of vehicles gliding across pavement and narrowly missing the camera. The action shots are wonderful, and many are real shots, not computer digitized as referenced by the end credits begging us not to go out and attempt these stunts that were performed on closed roads by professional drivers. We're not talking your standard danger tag, we're talking full size text on it's own screen. These drifters are for real, and that just enhances the feel for the film.Finally, and parents will love this, it is relatively clean. I don't think i heard a single f-bomb in the whole movie. I'm not saying that there is no cussing, but that it is so moderate and background oriented, that you can watch the movie and not even remember hearing it. There are about 5 or 6 kissing scenes, and only one contains a semi-main character. The worst content you will see here is skimpy outfits.This is just a fun, fun movie. It's not going to win any awards, but it has definitely set itself up to top the original in box office gross and will no doubt surpass 2 fast 2 furious. Don't be afraid to take the 13+ kidding to see this, though under 8-10 may be pushing it, unless they really understand cars and racing.",deac0n_fr0st,"Jun 17, 2006"
4,Worst in the hexology,"While the actors in this ""movie"" give un-noteworthy performance, sans Sung Kang, the rest of them only ""succeed"" at delivering lines. They do not emote or act engaging with one another. Were they interacting with blue/green screens ? I'm inclined to believe so. Black's ""drawl"" sounds like he tried his version instead of a dialect coach's. Or that's how he believes all ruralites speak. The ""story"" is neither plot or character driven, Tee is far from intimidating with his soft Jack Palance/ Steven Seagal emulation. Unless he was inspired from Mike Tyson for his role. Neela's Australian accent is inconsistent, and Lin seemed more tuned into action and cinematography. Another thing was why Han died, and as a consequence; Lin had to plug the inconsistencies with the sequels. Han has mentioned in 4 and 5 about Tokyo. Obviously, no foresight into what's entailed if you're trying to explain why a character croaked in three more movies. Furthermore,where this one had no trace of story, the next two tried to substantiate that. Which doesn't hold water. Also, if Sean commits a petty offense in Tokyo, how could that possibly incriminate him in the U.S.? Does jurisdiction exist in this universe ? How can high schoolers afford such high end cars ? Are they all in collusion with the Yakuza ? I'll tell you something else: If you sacrilegiously stab a import motor into a classic domestic, you'll go to hell where Hitler is admiring Ford.",nvjs,"Mar 18, 2013"

8,Tokyo Racing,"The ""Fast and Furious"" dilogy in the early 2000s became a kind of canon for fans to see cool pumped cars with bright neon lighting. Drive, powerful soundtrack, interesting story - all this was present in the films with Paul Walker. And it was surprisingly unusual to realize that the third part would focus on completely different characters, and even on the other side of the Earth. At first, I observed myself a certain rejection in this regard to this project. However, after just a couple of dozen minutes, the plot is addictive, and the picture is fun to watch.""Tokyo Drift"" undertakes to tell about the nightlife of the capital of Japan, where the main character arrives. And even if he is still a high school student, the guy joins the nightlife of the metropolis, where there is also an underground world of beautiful tuned cars. The picture, however, focuses not on speeds, as it was in previous paintings, but on drifting, when craftsmen manage to drive not only fast on small sites, but also fit into turns, sending their cars into a controlled skid. It was a fresh trend of the film, it was shown in an interesting and tasteful way. However, this does not mean that nothing has been prepared here for fans of racing through the dark streets of the city. Such things are necessarily in store from the creators, and the tricks are performed at the proper level.The screenwriters did not invent something extraordinary in terms of the plot, habitually placing the protagonist in new living conditions for him, where he will have to make his way to the very top, be sure to get a powerful opponent and of course get a passion. The film is unlikely to present any surprises in the course of the plot, but in general the picture looks very cheerful, not allowing the viewer to lose interest in what is happening on the screen. The film catches, probably, in another way: a good video next to it and an ultramodern soundtrack that successfully fits into the corresponding scenes.The work of the whole team is impressive. On the screen we see the actors, their vicissitudes, but much in the film depended on the stuntmen and stunt directors. The guys did a great job, giving a really driving action for all fans of this genre.""Tokyo Drift"" turned out to be a good ""Fast and Furious"". Other, unusual - this is a fact. But after a couple of films in the series, viewers will realize that this is quite an interesting part of the overall franchise, and this picture has only expanded the edges of a huge world with a lot of heroes and villains for us. And they did it quite worthily.8 out of 10.",alekspredator87,"Dec 14, 2022"
3,if your ages 4-8 this is an OK movie,"wow if this was a kids movie it would b a 8 out of 10 but its actually 4 grown folks which is hard 2 believe. i guess if like cars and get in trouble go 2 Tokyo because someone will give u a car if u help them take over the Yaqui's. this movie is so ""off point"" its so retarded and i never been 2 Tokyo but I'm sure its nothing like that. its just a fantasy world that you cant relate 2 (which is fine but) its not entertaining or well done so its not worth it. this is an above average movie if you are four to eight years old and you like cars and crappy music and horrible acting.Vin diesel just tops the movie off as being incredible boring and stupid and gay in the land where cars and tires grow on trees and people give u money and everyone is under the age of 18.",fasfada,"Oct 29, 2006"

3,The story of a cretin.,"The movie said this was the story of a loner. No it's not. It's the story of a bloke who is so totally self absorbed with himself that his shoes squelch. Right from the opening title this cretin masters the art of being the most selfish unit ever to walk the Earth. His Mum should have left him to go to jail, then we could all watch him become some enormous blokes sex toy. That'd be a better story too. The character is so annoying that it even degenerates into his 'look'. He's tries to incorporate Zoolanders 'Blue Steel' or 'Magnum' stare, but it actually makes him look like he's trying to expel gas. Without doubt, this guy is the biggest Wally in any movie.

5,"This one is a little much, and deviates too much from the original","I like how they tried to tell a new story within the Fast and the Furious franchise, but this one goes a bit too far in trying to deliver on the action without the story to back it up. It just isn't the same with the main character being more of a loner than someone who teams up and is all about family. The cars aren't as good, the acting isn't as good, the story isn't as good. It is a fun watch if you are just looking for driving and action, but it doesn't go much further than that. It is still a big enough part of the franchise to put ""Tokyo Drift"" into our vernacular probably forever, but the re-watch of this one doesn't warrant a very high rating when compared to some other movies in the franchise.",jaredlemin,"Jan 9, 2025"
8,The fast and the furious: Tokyo drift,"Got a free screening pass to see it 6-12, saw it with some car buddies, the dork I am took notes.This movie had more semblance of a plot than the rest of the franchise, the action stayed fresh and actually flowed with the plot, and the characters actually had motivation this time! There weren't any HUGE glaring inaccuracies (other than daddy throwing sonny the keys to a car with NO ENGINE in it...) The three cameos in the film were well placed, though a bit campy at the very end. The cars and action sequences were amazingly choreographed, one even leaving my whole theatre clapping for the protagonist.I give 8/10 because of low expectations, and being totally blown away when it was much better than I expected.",dineshaishu,"Jul 29, 2019"
4,Good if not better than the original Fast and the Furious,"Following the box-office financial success of 2 Fast 2 Furious, another sequel was already planned for a release in the summer of 2006. So now I move on to the third film, but is chronologically the sixth film in the series as it is the film to take place before Furious 7, ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"".I won't explain the whole plot, but here is a quick summary: A teenager named Sean Boswell becomes a major competitor in the world of drift racing after moving in with his father in Tokyo to avoid a jail sentence in America.The story is a little bit incoherent, but this is ""The Fast and the Furious"", so I will keep this review very short.Needless to say, I love ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"". It has a great story, great action, a good musical score and darn good performances from the cast.The action is really top-notch. The car chases was very intense and much reckless this time around because this had some reckless behavior in this film, so this is why the movies have a PG-13 rating. This film did have a scene where a character named Han-Seoul Oh dies in a car crash, which we see again in the later two films, ""Fast and Furious 6"", which was released in 2013 and ""Furious 7"" in 2015. But in the sixth film, it was revealed that Owen Shaw's brother, Deckard Shaw, killed him and blew up his car. That was just sad and a little scary to see.The car chase at the beginning of the film was a little disturbing to watch because after the two boys race each other over a girl, they are all shown with blood on their faces. Han is also shown with blood on his face, but that doesn't stop me from liking or reviewing this movie.The acting is really great. Lucas Black plays the role of Sean Boswell, the main character, and Black would play the part of Sean Boswell in the seventh film in the film franchise, Furious 7. Bow Wow plays the role of Twinkie and he does an okay performance, but he is also in the seventh film using archival footage.Sung Kang plays the role of Han Seoul-Oh and he would play that role for the next three films in the franchise. He does an incredible job with the dialog written for him.Nathalie Kelley plays the role of Neela, who is Takashi's boyfriend, but has romantic feelings for Lucas Black's character and she does a darn good job in her performance. Brian Tee as Takashi / Drift King just drove me crazy. He is the perfect villain and his performance is very dark and serious. Tee as Takashi / Drift King just really creeped me out when the first scene with him shows.The only character to return from the previous entry, which was the first film, titled The Fast and the Furious, which was released in June of 2001 is Dominic Toretto, played by Vin Diesel as he agreed to make a cameo in the film in exchange for Universal's ownership to the rights to his Chronices of Riddick franchise and character, in lieu of financial payment. The musical score composed by Brian Tyler is just amazing and he would compose music for the fourth film, titled Fast & Furious, the fifth film, titled Fast Five and the seventh installment, which is just titled Furious 7. He blends the musical instruments together in this spectacular musical score.The direction by Justin Lin was bad but I really liked it and the script was written by Christopher Morgan and he really does an incredible job with an amazing dialog and is very cool.Overall, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is as good if not better than the first film, while there are some major flaws, it is still enjoyable and I still think this is watchable. For people who liked the first two and hated this one, watch it again and you will find a darn good story.",joshuadrake-39480,"Apr 23, 2015"
4,A third Fast film that for me is a let down,"Drifting is a strange kind of racing, one that could if given its chance be very nicely done and fun to watch, unfortunately this film although giving it a good go fails to capture that incentive. Yes Fast and Furious movies don't get more random than this, a complete off shoot with a plot not wholly predictable but still just downright basic. My problem with this lies very much in the hands of the director Justin Lin whose reckless directing of a well, reckless movie makes this just too poor to be even OK. Our story is set in Tokyo of course, a young man by the name of Sean Boswell is sent to live with his father in the city because he is one bad kid apparently. Boswell is a bit obsessed with racing, something that puts him at odds with his father but also gets him into trouble at times with the local gangs. The plot was just too average to be anything more, tired old lines about racing very quickly extinguish any skill the movie may have, and that's not to mention the horrible way in which it is directed. Justin Lin is not on any form here whatsoever, he does nothing to make this better nor explore the script for any actual differences between this and what has been done before, I won't doubt the race scenes and some stunts, but his work in the more serious moments is just downright bad. As for the actors well it is really quite a mixed bag, some are poor some are OK with no one ever really reaching heights. Sung Kang is for me the best actor here, calm is the name of the game when it comes to him and I felt the scenes in which he(as the character of Han) is in, are much better than others. Boswell is portrayed by Lucas Black and he is very bland, not really bad but just doesn't do a lot, I felt it was quite a strange choice of main character. Cast such as Bow Wow make it slightly more fun but don't add much at all to the story, in the end the actors have to ride a long on a plot too dumb to be positive. I did however enjoy the style of the movie, in fact for parts of this engagement levels can be high, but for others not so much. It did feel to me the kind of flick which could at one part be sending you to sleep and the next be getting you pumped up; I think it is Lin yet again who is the cause of the more dull moments. Chris Morgan writes this and does a job I can only describe as under par, the screenplay is not well made, doesn't completely fall flat but still has those lines I mentioned which are just old and stale and have no place in films over and over again.Would I watch it again?, well maybe not because I didn't like it pure and simple, not the kind of movie I had deep dislike and definitely not hate but still a certain degree of disappointment. I think fans of the series up to the point of this film if you are indeed a fan of the first two will enjoy this, I can't see this topping their lists but still has that style again and the music and clothing to match them as well. Overall The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a bit of a waste, a missed opportunity to fully explore the Japanese racing scene and all it has to offer, instead bringing us the same old kind of stuff we are used to and that for me makes this a let down.",willcundallreview,"Aug 29, 2015"
10,Maybe Best One So Far!,"This movie is SO good. All the actors, even though most not being actually Japanese really played their parts well. The cars were really cool. There was humor in the movie which is always good. The movie also has depth. And the new actress playing Neela is SO pretty.Apart from maybe one or two scenes where the depiction of underground Japanese society seems inaccurate (I wouldn't know, just seemed more like American society), I really really liked the movie!! My boyfriend even said that it may even be better than the first two.I recommend this movie to seriously anyone who likes cars, who likes seeing pretty chicks, who gets adrenaline rush from racing and whoever just wants to watch a seriously awesome movie. =P",k4j_4eva,"Jun 21, 2006"

In one was or another you will identify with him; whether it is trying to help others, but getting in trouble yourself, or simply trying to fit in within a culture that scorns your very existence as an outsider.You will see what the other end of the world has to offer on the concepts of style, sex, and of course, racing and its philosophy.You will witness what this subculture of street-racing can bring with it; respect, envy, greed...even the ultimate sacrifice.It is these which the first two movies lacked, but is what the third installment surely supplies.Enjoy the film!!!",jr_dread,"Jun 13, 2006"

5,A Different Type of Street Racing,"Constantly in trouble due to illegal racing, a high school senior named ""Sean Boswell"" (Lucas Black) is sent to live with his father who is in the military and stationed in Japan. When he gets there he immediately gravitates to a group of other students his age who are also involved in racing fast cars. However, because of the limited space in Tokyo the sport has changed to one that involves negotiating extremely tight corners in either an underground parking garage or a narrow road along the side of a mountain. The problem Sean has is not only that he is not used to this type of racing-known as drift racing--but also that his main rival is an arrogant punk named ""Takashi"" (Brian Tee) who is extremely jealous whenever his girlfriend, ""Neela"" (Nathalie Kelley) even looks at another guy. And there is some definite chemistry between her and Sean. It also doesn't help that Takashi thinks he can do whatever he wants because his uncle, ""Kamata"" (Sonny Chiba) is a high-ranking member of the Yakuza. One other problem is that Takashi is also extremely good at drift racing. In any case, with all of these areas of disagreement it is only a matter of time before Sean and Takashi have it out and when they do the stakes will be very high. Now, rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie certainly had some good moments here and there. Unfortunately, there were some scenes which were a little over-the-top and which caused the film to seem a bit uneven. That being the case, I rate this movie as about average and recommend it only to those who might enjoy a film of this type.",Uriah43,"Jan 16, 2017"

If you saw the first two movies, you need to see the third. Drifting is definitely better suited for a movie. Lots of turbo action, and not much NOS. this movie brings back the idea that not every person can get behind the wheel of a car and race like no tomorrow. If you go see this and expect it to be anything like the first two, your in for a good surprise. if you like Evo VIII's RX-8 and fast fast cars all done up custom you'll like this movie. I think i'm gonna have to go see it at least one more time.",josmialo,"Jun 16, 2006"

10,Lucas Black is a hit in new Fast and Furious flick,"I enjoyed watching this new movie of The Fast and The Furious. Lucas Black seemed to capture the spotlight in the movie. His character's background was entertaining. The ending is unexpected, but INTERESTING.Great movie.The only disadvantage of the movie is the storyline seems to drift off occasionally. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone that is into fast paced movies and also into the auto aspect. Nicer cars compared to the first to movies. No subtitles, which makes the movie, slightly confusing but you'll get the gist of it all.The trailer didn't do the movie any justice. It has a slight father & son bonding moment, brings some moments to heart.",sprtsmedchik,"Jun 20, 2006"
4,Someone thought that all you needed was cars and babes,"I can suspend my disbelief if needed. But it's just not possible for this movie.If the main character had any real charisma maybe I could like the movie more. But his character is annoying.If the movie had something resembling an interesting plot, maybe I could like the movie more. But it doesn't.The dialog is rock bottom. They go to some underground car scene and this dude throws a box of Kleenex at the main character (who I hate so much, I can't recall his name.) Some high school kid carries Kleenex in the car? And he says 'This is for when you blow your load'. That's about the level of dialog in the movie.The cool cars, and there are some damn cool cars, and female scenery are nice enough, but they can't save this movie.As for the story, it's less believable than a fairy tale. 1) This kid can't even drive at the start of the movie - at least they should have shown crazy-talent in the first race, so we could believe he can succeed later. It's not like this is a martial arts movie where we expect zero to hero in one lesson. 2) People let this unknown guy race their cars?! 3) All these high school kids own these seriously expensive cars?That's just scratching the surface. There's worse movies. Like Red Line (worst car movie ever maybe.) But not many.",michaeljhuman,"Aug 16, 2013"

4,A lacklustre edition to the series,"Following on the (somewhat) decent success of the first two films, The Fast and the Furious franchise adds a third, and supposed last, film. Paul Walker appeared in the first two films but has left for this entrant in the trilogy, completely destroying the remaining links to the original. In fact, other than the title and the promise of done-up cars and many skimpy dressed women; this is a completely different film from its predecessors. One of the attractive features of the first two films was the speed of the racing. The high-risk speed has been dumped for another form of racing known as drifting. Racers in this format do not rely on their speed to win races but the precision of their turns. The gliding of the cars on the turns is drifting. However, drift racing is not as popular in America as it is in Japan. Thus, Tokyo is the location for the third film (another difference from the first two films). However, the main character is an American, so how does he get to Tokyo? Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) is an outsider at his high-school who loves illegal street races. After managing to ruin his car in a race against a fellow high-school student, Sean is sent to Tokyo to live with his father to avoid jail time. While in the Japanese school, he befriends Twinkie (Bow Wow) and gets introduced to the world of underground racing in Japan. It is through this that he talks to Neela (Australian-born Nathalie Kelley), where it is obvious that she is the romantic interest of Sean. Despite not being allowed to drive, he challenges D.K. ala ""Drift King"" (Brian Tee), a boy with connections to the Yakuza (as well as being Neela's boyfriend) with someone else's car. After destroying the lent car because of his lack of knowledge on the art of drifting, he is forced to repay his debt by entering the dangerous Tokyo underworld to repay his debt. It is incredible to see that casting has decided to give the role of the main character to someone with even less charisma than Paul Walker (yes, it is possible). Lucas Black is a horrendous actor, as is Bow Wow and Nathalie Kelley, who all do their jobs but they almost detract from the film because they are all so one-dimensional. Some of the blame must be shifted to the screenwriters, who have written an implausible story. The fact that the Yakuza becomes involved in this film just completely ruins the believability and the film becomes farcical once it is introduced. The lines that have been given to the actors are all horrible as well, most likely influencing some of the actors' performances. It seems as if they have all been written with a mechanical efficiency. Another downside to this film is the decision to go with drift racing. The races in Tokyo Drift are not as engaging as the races in the previous two films. The lack of speed makes the races seem like time-fillers rather than entertainment. This decision to change the racing style has stopped this film from being better. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a lacklustre addition to the franchise.",iicool11,"Jul 20, 2006"
10,The Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift is superb,"I'm a great fan of the original Fast and Furious and was extremely excited when 2 Fast 2 Furious was released only to be extremely disappointed. I wasn't to keen on seeing the Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift but i'm really glad i did. This film is superb, its actioned pack and has a genuine believable story line to it that gets you sitting on the edge of your seats. The huge plus to this film was Vin Dieseal even though it was only for a short amount of time. The new cast has brought a fresh and exciting presence to the film. Bring on the 4th Fast and Furious and hopefully we'll see Vin Dieseal in it, as well as all the new cast. That would really bring the story together!!!!!!!",clareski,"Jun 25, 2006"

It was exciting to watch, and every scene was packed with action-filled sequences. The only problem I had was the predictability and simplicity of the story: an American teenager takes risks in the streets of Tokyo with bad-ass gangsters against him but eventually he emerges at the top. The movie could use a little bit of plot twists. The stunts were crisp-perfect and the camera work was absolutely amazing. The director really excels in this film genre.",jeromesgabilo,"Sep 27, 2022"
2,"Please, make it stop...","I guess I asked for it, when I said I didn't want another hot and cold movie. Tokyo Drift certainly is a one way street. In fact, Tokyo Drift is quite possibly the worst racing movie ever committed to film.Everything starts out with a high school cat fight. Our ""hero"", Sean Boswell, sporting one of the worst southern accents ever, races the local jock for his girlfriend. Soon after, he gets arrested. Rather than send him off to prison, he is shipped off to Tokyo to live with his military father. Despite what he's been told (cause what cool Hollywood teen does what they're told?) he becomes re-involved in illegal street racing but in Tokyo. It's nearly impossible to summarize this plot, mainly because I'm laughing so hard. The story is so ridiculous and clichéd, that I feel sorry for anyone, like me, who was drug to this movie.Pick anything about this movie, and it's borderline suicide inducing. The music is awful. Really, if I want to listen to generic rap playing over car racing, I'll switch on MTV. If this is what cinema has become, then I might as well jump off a cliff.The acting is horrendous. I have never seen someone butcher the bad boy role like Lucas Black has. His portrayal of Sean is not only unrealistic, it's disturbingly puny. If that is his ""bad boy"" setting, he must be a puppy in real life. Everyone else here is simply terrible. At one point, I could have sworn I was watching The Young And The Restless and I liked it better than the normal gear of this movie.As with (most) racing movie fans, none of that matters to them. The question is, does Tokyo Drift deliver some adrenaline pumping races? Absolutely not. First off, the shaky cam is worse here, than it was in The Bourne Supremacy. I needed a barf bag during one. The inclusion of ""drifting"" is the biggest mistake. It chokes almost all the races and causes the excitement to be sucked out (not that I cared one way or the other). Finally, there are far too many slo-mo shots. This is not the Matrix, people; it's The Fast and The Furious. What is this doing in this movie? In closing, you would have to be drunk, high, or both to enjoy Tokyo Drift. It's a clichéd mess that not only delivers some fantastically bad acting, but doesn't even give us one decent race. If you are just dying for some racing action, I'd suggest drifting on over to Cars, because this film is just embarrassing.",KarisLOVER,"Jul 9, 2006"
8,Excellent driving and cinematography!,"Saw this movie last night and enjoyed most of it! There was a small bit of violence in the film which was disconcerting, but I guess you get that with the mafia scene in different countries. (and it was expected - as in the movie rating) The driving was fantastic - loved some of the camera work and stunts - very impressive.I'd recommend anyone interested in driving, and also Japanese culture check it out - it's a nice change from your typical American driving films!! Also, Australian actor Nathalie Kelley was awesome! Another nice twist featuring this new young actor - it's great to hear an Aussie accent throughout! Well played part.I think the movie ended well too :-) Enjoy!",au_bb,"Jun 15, 2006"
4,"Fast & Furious 3 ""Now With Turning!""","It took me a while to get around to this one given that it's the other Fast & Furious movie--the one without any of the main cast in it (save for a couple of cameos). It wasn't really worth the wait.Justin Lin brings some energy to the proceedings but the movie can't escape the lack of star power, unconvincing characters, lackluster romance, and formulaic script. Also, Sonny Chiba doesn't beat the crap out of anyone, which made me sad.The cars looked nice, but I'm not a car guy so the particulars were probably lost on me. I didn't quite understand the point of the drift racing. If I spent many months of income on pimping out my Mazda I don't think I'd want to slam it through a parking garage at top speed. I guess Tokyo doesn't have much of a nightlife and people have to make their own fun.Super-fans of the franchise will probably want to take a look. Every one else can probably skip it.",My_Pet_Mongoose,"Jun 18, 2013"

5,The Flat and the Furious.,"My journey through the Fast and the Furious series has brought me to the third film, Tokyo Drift, which - alongside Fast Five - was one of the only movies in this series I'd seen some years ago. I remembered basically nothing about the film, and rewatching it, I can see why. It's a bit of a snooze, even though there are moments that are kind of fun here and there. I think it has a good final act... actually, that's where most of the fun stuff is. It opens with a stupid, over-the-top race, and then meanders for about an hour or so, all before finally delivering some decent action in the last half-hour.I'd say it's better than the first movie, and I genuinely wonder whether I'll get to the end of the series now liking all the sequels more than that one. I think it disappoints a little after the second movie, though, which I was pleasantly surprised by.Tokyo Drift did the impossible by making me wish Vin Diesel would return to the series. The protagonist of Tokyo Drift is very bland, and when Diesel shows up in his cameo near the end, he's so much more charismatic. Guess that sometimes, you don't know what you've got until it's gone. But Paul Walker still trumps Diesel at this stage, and I wonder if Tokyo Drift would've been a little better if they got his character wrapped up in all the stuff the actual main character does.Here's hoping the fourth movie and those after are better. I like these movies when they get silly and over-the-top (and when they're less about racing too, to be honest), and I wish Tokyo Drift had been more consistently goofy. I only really had fun in the final act, and most of the film before then made me feel tired.",Jeremy_Urquhart,"Jun 19, 2024"
10,this movie was off the hook it was better then the first 2,"The Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift not only contained evos, skylines and the vielside Mazda rx7 it contained a lot of hot girls and for u guys that like classic cars it contained that. The 67 mustang they supped up wit a skyline engine was crazy and i know everyone will fall in love with it. Also a great ending it just never stopped wit the action the whole audience was going crazy at the end wit Vin diesal return but its only for like 2 mins, but this movie u will be on the edge of ur seats. This one was much better then the 2nd movie and just a little bit better then the first but the lead actor black is the next Paul walker this movie rocked.",ballermm,"Jun 17, 2006"
3,More focus on cars and action than the characters,"At this point, the cars are the true stars of this franchise. They are exciting, fast and ultimately have more personality plus screen presence than most of the actors.",naty-77974,"May 2, 2022"
10,' loved it its was extremely beautiful',"i have loved everyone of the fast and furious films as i love cars and have always wanted to become a female racer. the film was very predictable but all films are. I'm very emotional so me and me female friends cried in the middle though none of the boys did. i loved the romance and the cars and the glamour and gracefulness of drifting. I think all the actors were great even my friends that didn't like cars enjoyed the film. loved it all!!! i feel that i got my moneys worth and that i would recommend this film to anyone, most of all under 30's and not just boys. Its a film i could watch again as it contains my passion for hot cars and partying.",shuger1,"Jun 25, 2006"

2,Famous Toyo Drift?,"There was nothing I liked about this movie (except maybe the Hulk car), so I can't even give it 3 stars. I wish I could, but my heart will not allow it.I was bored the entire time. The ENTIRE time. The highlights of this movie were still boring to me, and it didn't matter what the stakes are and how many visual effects or mind blowing drifts were there on the screen. I simply didn't care.I had no reason to, really. Why would I? We got completely new, random character and were told basically nothing about the guy, but the fact that he was a bad boy who liked to smash some cars and get as many girl as possible. After finishing the movie I still feel like I don't know him.The reason is - I didn't pay attention. I know I didn't and I could probably blame myself for that but then again why would I? The movie wasn't interesting. It didn't show me why I should forget characters from previous Fast & Furious and instead focus on the new Mr Bad Boy. I didn't WANT to pay attention. I just wanted to get over with it and skip to the next part.Maybe the reason why so many people liked it is because they remember it from when it came out. Maybe back then it was a real banger, maybe it was new and refreshing. But we're not in those time anymore, and as much as I love the first F&F, this one definitely didn't age well. Unless you're just a big boy who likes to watch cars. There's nothing wrong with that, we all like something that objectively, let's be honest, isn't really that good. This time it's just not the case for me.",polajakimowicz,"Feb 26, 2024"

5,"An average addition to the ""Fast and the furious"" franchise.","Not being a particularly ardent car-lover or fan of street racing at all, I didn't go into this movie with high hopes. Nevertheless, even for non-revheads like me there are enough enjoyable elements in this film to keep you from walking out. Some exhilarating car races, notable moments of humour and of course a veritable parade of attractive and underdressed women kept me entertained. The illogical storyline and numerous plot holes began to get annoying by the end; if the movie wasn't so long then this wouldn't have been as noticeable. Also, the Vin Diesel cameo was rather poorly played. Besides these admittedly minor gripes, there is a lot of fun to be had here - flashy cars, hot girls and a surprisingly competent Lil' Bow Wow in an amusing side-role.",reti_incarnate,"Jun 22, 2006"
8,WHY o why did they have to use... HIM????,"Anyone who has seen the first two movies would agree that part of the movies' appeal (at least to the girls) was Paul Walker's sex appeal. Anyone who was anticipating a similar character in the third installment would have been as greatly disappointed as I was. The main character of Sean seemed to be trying to portray similar characteristics to Brian O'Conner but dismally failed! Lucas Black almost ruined the movie for me. not just because he is pretty much BUTT ugly, but his acting skills bordered on ridiculous. Besides this MAJOR flaw in this movie, I found it to be quite enjoyable. As a fan of the first two films, I was not disappointed with the cars or racing action. In fact, I enjoyed the high danger drifting more than the regular racing! The culture of the Tokyo nightlife was enthralling, and I was attracted by all the colors and costumes featured. It seems that if this movie had not contained the appalling acting of Lucas Black, this movie would have been even more of a box office hit than it was. 8/10 for storyline and racing, but 2/10 for acting",stacka_girl,"Sep 29, 2006"

9,My Favorite of the series,"I've watched all the series (except for the Hobbs spin off) and Tokyo drift is my favorite. Its like OHMSS of the Bond series, in that it fits in evolutionary point of the series where they get things just right, and there is a great balance.Lets face it, this is a divisive FandF movie. A lot of people hate it, and to many its one of the best, if not the best of the series.Tokyo drift doesn't have some of the ridiculous over the top unrealistics scenes, like cars shooting at planes, and fighting tanks or racing submarines. Some of those action sequences in the later movies are fun, but unbelievable and really take away from the tone of what is really a straight car action movie.Tokyo drift doesn;t ahve the other the top military aspects. Sure there is a Yakuza element, but ultimately, these are just people racing cars. There's no machine guns involved, no martial arts fights... its about car culture, and how that fits with people.The movie gets it just right. Justin Lin has come in and made it slicker than the first two movies, however it still relatively realistic unlike the later ones.On top of that, its set in an interesting exotic locale, and Lucas Black's character as a fish out of water character is interesting enough, as are some of the supporting characters, including Sung Kang. That said, bits of it are not authentic, and while Sonny Chiba is an icon in Japan, his English dialogue is stilted here.Overall, its the only one of hte series I watch regularly. The series could really benefit from having Lucas Black's character back involved!",info-5918,"Dec 19, 2019"

9,From someone who has reviewed more than ONE movie ever,"I'm not sure why this movie didn't spark the interest that the other FATF movies did but I think this is the best one of the three. The cinematography was awesome, the women are gorgeous. The villain was believable, it has almost non-stop action, and some genuinely funny lines. I never believe any reviews from anyone that has only reviewed one movie because they obviously have an agenda in either over hyping or needlessly trashing a movie. What I don't understand is why isn't anyone putting legitimate critiques up of this movie. The weakest point in this movie is trying to swallow that a guy w/ a southern accent could so instantly be accepted and trusted in a prominent drift club in Tokyo. OK suspend that disbelief and this move MOVES! I never once felt bored or lost or clicked my tongue and rolled my eyes like I did in the last FATF movie. Maybe people were hoping for more of the same trash, I'm not sure but this is an above average, I'd even say exciting, summer race film not like many others. I hope this sparks some other real reviews.",yoncenator,"Jun 19, 2006"
4,this becoming worse,Fast and the Furious started with high boost in its kind but it becoming worse by acting and quality. 2. film also good with visual effects but this one is worst nightmare. As some of you know this series going parallel with nfs series and share the incoming $ . But producers must have better screenplay and actors or actresses. When we come to Lucas Blake ( Sean Boswell ) he act like he wanna make this movie worst in the history at least Brian King ( DK ) rocks in this film like he never did before.After all i can say don't watch this film if u don't want to hate from hot wheels. I hope that next films won't interest with drift or drag races and excite us with their story and cars and interesting races.,lucky_is_me,"Dec 20, 2006"
10,Good Movie,"I think this movie is far more superior than the first two. The cars are excellent and the special effects raise up your heart beats at times. The setting Tokyo is very interesting, it's quite different from the first two. At first I thought this was going to be a lame movie but it really surprised me, it was more than what I expected. The actors are great, you will never get bored. The plot is intense, there are sad and good moments. I love the movie soundtrack and I love the ending. The ending was the best part. I think this is a must see movie, trust me it wont hurt seeing it. I can't wait to see part 4, I hope it takes place in Tokyo as well.",blue_skyrose,"Jun 24, 2006"
4,tedious and dull...not a movie I'd plan on seeing again,"Here comes yet another race car movie with fairly good acting, mediocre directing, a poorly-written script, and badly executed shots with nothing to show but a few scenes worth mentioning about, but soon to be forgotten. As will Tokyo Drift be in a few years. It's just not the kind of movie to spark interest in the majority of audiences.So maybe there were a few memorable parts done by the characters, such as when our lead guy gets involved in an accident at the beginning and smiles at the other two victims with blood-encased teeth. But pretty much, the rest of his part is just your average want-to-be tough guy who will lose the first time and come around the second time. His friends include some guy who never seems to run out of cars (gee, how unexpected), a guy who sells broken junk, and others. Lots of dull and uninteresting characters. And we get some highway chase scenes that are hardly any more exciting than the rest of the movie.Overall, The Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift cannot be described as a disappointment, mainly because, not much could ever be expected from a movie such as this. And it is not one I'd plan on seeing again.",TheUnknown837-1,"Dec 9, 2006"

Same deal here.We don't see movies like this for plot, nor do we expect actors that will make us cry. I saw this movie for its cars, action, and women. And I have to say all three were very nice.When you watch this movie you'll be pretty impressed that all the drifting is done by real people.

5,"Fast cars, dangerous driving, wrapped around a sliver of plot","(48%) A movie that screams ""yoof culture"" from the very first frame, and because the hip-hop and J-pop littered soundtrack both lack any sort of deep meaning resulting in the soundtrack occasionally needing to dip into a typical Hollywood movie score to build any sort of feel or mood. But to be honest adding any sort of soul to this is like adding Furtmun and Mason organic chutney to a big mac, as this is as deep as a puddle left behind by a 4 week old puppy.

9,Watch this movie!,"There's only one part of this movie I disagree with, but I don't want to spoil it at all, so you'll have to email me or something if you really want to know about that (phoenix_darkhawk@yahoo.com). Tight rides and tighter tracks, Very few sequels stand up to the original, but this one was probably the best of the trilogy. There was less focus on the appearance of the vehicles than the first two, more on the story, and better racing. The guest star at the very end is a nice touch too, for those who have liked the whole series. The acting is overall good, even though I rather disliked the heavy southern accent of the main character, he just sounded too much like a hick (and I'm from Oklahoma!). Seriously though, if you like good races, fast cars, and a good story, this is a must see movie.",phoenix_darkhawk,"Jun 24, 2006"
4,A Bad Vacation,"This review is going to be a little rougher than the last two as there are a couple things I want to point out. I'm a gaijin named Sean. I love Tokyo. I love Yakuza related films. So this film obviously was built for me and my ilk. While the other two were appealing to the fourteen year old American crowd, this one is more accessible to a different crowd while still maintaining the integrity of what makes a Fast and Furious film what it is.Sean is Forest Gump's son, complete with terrible Southern accent. He's also ten years too old to be in high school but we'll let that one slide too. After getting into a race (over a girl) that involved a lot of property destruction and reckless endangerment, the police let him get away with it because his mom is sending him to Tokyo to live with his father, who serves in the Navy. Makes no sense because the American Navy is stationed further south and has nothing to do with Tokyo, but we'll let everything slide because pretty much the entirety of the opening exposition is nonsensical and stupid.One big example is how Sean is enrolled at a Japanese high school. Okay, that's fine, and the fact there are other Americans there shows it may be a sort of transfer high school. The problem is the fact the teachers don't speak English, thus making a guy who can't speak Japanese completely useless to the institution. Why not enroll him in a school where the teachers speak English (of which there are a few in Tokyo)? Since Sean was sent to Tokyo to get away from racing (which makes sense since the vast majority of people in Tokyo don't have cars to commute) he, of course, winds up getting into racing anyway. Drifting to be precise. He pisses off the nephew of a Yakuza, gets with the guy's girl (thus proving that this series has no plot aside from dumb guy trying to get with bad guys girl).The racing in this movie is actual racing, neither the garbage of the first film nor the more action-centric driving of the second. Tokyo Drift has some really good races, the best in the series so far, and thankfully these races aren't marred by the nitrous button (though it is used once).Sean, the character, is even more boring than O'Conner (somehow), the female fling is forgettable and useless, the bad guy is lame, and the obligatory black side kick is Bow Wow, instantly knocking multiple points off.The ending is what ties this film in with the others, though it doesn't feel at all natural and seems to just be fan service. (EDIT: This film does actually have a lot to do with the series as you get further in).Tokyo Drift is a decent addition to the franchise, one that does a lot better job with the racing than previous iterations. But aside from that it doesn't have any reason to keep you coming back for a second watch and, as such, it falls flat.",sn319,"Dec 6, 2014"

5,Eye Candy just like the other 2,"Fun, Fast and Flashy. Like the other 2 it mostly ignores physics and completely ignores common sense. The drifting is cool but better in person with real professionals. I think a good half of the drifting in this was CG. Hell there was more ""real"" drifting in the Dukes of Hazard remake.Finally I think the most annoying part was during the major chase through Tokyo none of these drivers ""drove"" to get away. Drifting is NOT the fastest way through a corner, so if your running from someone why would you drift.Any way, I enjoyed it but if you like cars or racing, and have a average understanding of both, your gonna be shaking your head a lot.",Physicker,"Jun 17, 2006"
4,movie in two words- Tokyo and drift,"This movie was brutally average, and it seemed that the film makers wanted to accomplish two things. First was to make a movie in Japan. The other was to make a movie with expensive cars doing maneuvers not filmed before. The result of which was a movie mad with excellent visuals and fast paced action and the story was badly hurt by it. So much emphasis on making a cool looking movie that every one seemed to forget about the story. And there was good potential for a phenomenal story but any where they could have made the story shine they failed. Characters that were important to the main character were left under developed. You cant blame the screenwriter, but I haven't seen the script so maybe you can. And important plot points were nulled over and passed off just to get to the racing. But all in all the movie wasn't terrible or a complete loss, everything that made the movie bad can easily be corrected with another sequel. Which I am sure that Hollywood wouldn't have a problem with, it means more money for them.",garysbass,"Jun 23, 2006"

That is how great it is. Lucas Black is awesome in it. He really has grown up since The War and Sling Blade. HHHHHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!! I give it 20 thumbs up.

9,The Best of the Three!,"Out of the first three movies, this film is definitely the best. I am not ripping the first two films, but this film has more to it.

He eventually gets shipped off to live with his dad in Tokyo. While there, he gets involved in more street racing. But, he has to watch out for one lethal racer and his uncle.As I mentioned before, the acting is not as good as the first two. I still liked the actors. Lucas Black did a nice job. I thought the Asian actors did a wonderful job.The cars, ladies, stunts, etc are very, very good. The sound effects were fantastic especially during the final racing scene. Great music, too!

Thanks to that advice your son is now a delinquent.One of my worries when I watch movies is that the movie will be predictable. Of course a lot of movies you expect to be predictable and it doesn't detract from the movie because of how well the movie is done. Everyone knew the Titanic would sink and that movie made a billion dollars. Tokyo Drift on the other hand was predictable and horribly done. I guess the producers got tired of suped up Japanese cars in America so they moved the action to Japan and figured the change of scenery would make the movie fresh. No. Everything played out virtually the same down to the American car being used at the end.",view_and_review,"Jun 15, 2008"

10,Destined to be a Cult Classic,"Tokyo Drift is going to be one of those love it, hate it movies, much like 2001: A Space Odyssey and other cult classics. For those who are in to cars, this movie much like the first of the series brings a never-before-seen aspect of car driving to the silver screen. The drifting scenes are revolutionary and exciting; it may be remembered as the Bullit of the 21st century. It may do for drifting what the other previous two series did for tuning. That is bringing it out of the underground and making it more mainstream. Unlike other director who might of taken the short-cut and the easy way out of using CG to create the drift scenes. Director Justin Lin actually used real drivers and cars, which helps to bring a level of realism not found in other films. Justin Lin also accomplishes that he is so adapt at, that is portraying a part of Asian youth culture that the general public usually doesn't now see.The story itself is a trial and trued pattern of forbidden romance. Although the plot may lack originality, it is far from boring. But the focus of the film is on the cars and the driving and not on the plot. I think this is where the film gets into trouble with critics who lack the appreciation of the cars and the driving scenes. Many reviewers get lost in trying to find something from this film that is not meant to be there. If you want they want something mind opening, watch Brokeback Mountain. If you want to watch a movie for exciting and great action/driving scenes that you wouldn't be ashamed to talk to your friends about, watch this movie.",liubhs02,"Jun 27, 2006"

10,Action packed,"OK so is Tokyo Drift worth watching???? Well I can honestly say..Yes Tokyo Drift is worth watching, the car's are amazing, the acting isn't really up to that good of a standard but in all yes it's worth a watch! The plot serves the movie well, a kid moves from America to Tokyo after having trouble in America, some people say that it made for a crap plot but to be honest it makes for a good plot, better than any others movies that are coming out of Hollywood these days! In all I rate the movie a great 10/10, Go see the movie and watch those cars burn some rubber! Tokyo Drift has great effects with great motors, if you don't see this movie then you will regret it in the future so if I was you get your cinema tickets quick before it's taken from the big screen and released on DVD cause there's nothing like watching a film of this kind anywhere!",gazzalere,"Aug 8, 2006"

3,Lots of cars but no real people,"If you liked the first two movies in the saga, you will probably not like this one. And the reason is that Fast & Furious is not just about fast cars, but about characters with charisma, and their story. Not just nice cars driving as fast as possible by empty - headed characters. You cannot find any single good performance in the whole movie, any single character with at least a gram of personality. The plot is absolutely dumb and predictable and you do not really worry about whatever happens to the characters. You will enjoy this film if you only want to see fast cars, nice women with too small dresses, and techno - music that not fits the scenes. I f you are looking for something more, watch the first movie in the saga.",sergio-arauzo,"Sep 5, 2014"
5,"fast cars, fast women, no plot","Well first off the cars were awesome,Tokyo looked awesome the girls were hot,, but the plot just plain sucked. I thought that the plot was very unrealistic hard to believe. didn't care for the main character really at all, Sweet home Alabama guy meets the Yakuza.. come on what the heck were they actually thinking,, i'm happy that Vin Diesel did make an appearance, but i think he made the wise choice staying out of this one for the most part till the last scene. The music was fast and fun, loved the girls little outfits t hat reveal practically everything, i like the Yakuza references in the movie. i just think that the plot could have been way better, and they needed someone else please in the lead role. overall, see it for the cars, the girls, the music, but don't see it for the plot, because you will be disappointed.",kairingler,"Oct 9, 2007"

3,Stupid and Predictable,"The story is about a messed up teenager (don't really know *why* he's so messed up, though) who can't get out from behind a wheel. This gets him constantly into trouble. Eventually with the Yakuza, no less. Trouble tends to start with a girl. Just about every punk kid in this film is young, dumb and full of cum. If they catch you so much as talking to their girl, that means she's probably sleeping with you so you gotta die. That's basically the impression I got watching this nonsense. The characters (wait... who else but the messed up kid was acting?) are not well-developed and the plot, I think, has many holes. I would not recommend this film. Waste your time on something else.",knight_armour,"Sep 28, 2008"
10,Oh Yea!!!,"The Fast and The Furious:Tokyo Drift was by far the best Fast and the Furious installment made. It is packed with exciting race scenes and a good story. Although I found some parts to be a little corny, it had no effect on my overall enjoyment while watching this movie, and i never felt bored at any point in the movie. The action was accompanied by a great selection of music which added to the ""feel"" of the movie. If you have not seen this movie yet, I suggest going out and watching it ASAP. You can't go wrong with loud cars, lots of women, and good music. If you enjoyed the last couple parts of the series, I'm sure this one won't let you down. And if you do watch and don't like it, I think you might be crazy!!!",sethcooper06,"Jun 24, 2006"

4,Nod,"The movie tries to go back and catch the essence of the first movie. It might not (really) have any actors from the previous installments, but the ""Fast & Furious"" feeling is there ... and wait til the end for a little surprise (unless someone told you or you read it, you won't really expect it).The thing is, the stunts are top notch, really good. But the story doesn't carry through Lucas Black seems to loathe every minute he is on screen, while cursing his agent, who got him the role(?). Even Paul Walker felt more ""right"" in the franchise. If you wanna fast forward and watch the stunts, you might add a point or two to my vote.",kosmasp,"Aug 11, 2009"

4,The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift Review,"The Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift(2006) Starring: Lucas Black, Shad Moss, Nathalie Kelley, Brian Tee, Suang Kang, Brian Goodman, Sonny Chiba, Leonardo Nam, Jason Tobin, Keiko Kitagawa, Alden Villaverde, Koji Kataoka, Kevin Ryan, Lynda Boyd, and Vin Disel Directed By: Justin Lin Review On the streets of Tokyo, speed needs no translation... You know I was never big fan of the whole Fast & Furious franchise until I saw five then they made six which I did not see, and seven which I will see even though I said I wasn't going too, because I love watching films no matter what and I want to respect Paul Walker. But Fast Five will always remain as one of my favorite films of all time and my second favorite high powered car film, my first is Speed Racer. This third entry from the series is when people became curious of the franchise, it revolves around a guy who gets kicked out of America for street racing and moves in with his dad in Tokyo. When he gets there he meets a group of people who are drifters, one in particular is the Drift king. You see Han from the fifth film(snacking as usual) and he likes the kid so he teaches him how to drift. Han is also stealing money from the Drift king and he wants to take down and his new prodigy with speed in the fast lane. The film wasn't all that fun which is what these movies are meant to be, their meant to be fun action movies . But the only fun out of this film like the first two is the street racing. That's it. Not any fights, not any characters, not even any shoot outs. This film just lacked the amount of fun you would want in an action film. The performances in this film are as bland as butter, the only one who seemed to be trying where Suang Kang and Brian Tee they were the only ones I bought in this movie. Everyone else is just bland or terrible. Don't even get me started on Bow Wow, the credit shows him as Shad Moss being the actors name but my TV said Bow Wow so I think LetterBox is wrong on that. But yeah he was the worst thing about this movie. The Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift does have cool car sequences but also a watered down and uninteresting plot, bad acting and characters you can't get into, I'm giving this drifter a two out of five.",Spideyfan-963-246215,"Sep 9, 2016"
10,Most entertaining movie this summer,"Superman, Nacho Libre, Devil Wears Prada, Pirates of the Caribbean, of all movies released this summer, this was the only one I never found myself falling asleep to. Enough action and semblance of plot to keep you entertained for the whole duration. Sonny Chiba brings a great vibe to this movie, and Bow Bow was surprisingly enjoyable (when compared to his unoriginal, irritating ""counterpart"" Lil Romeo). I would see the 4th one, Tokyo was probably the perfect setting for the racing, and the drift stunts were excellently executed. Lucas Black does a good job being the jerk that you either love or hate. The beginning of the movie alone is worth the price of admission, if only to see the kid from Home Improvement get messed up. I think the younger audience (15-30 year olds) will find it easy to identify with some of the characters in the movie, albeit without so much of the underground mob-influences. Go see this movie, it is easily the best in the franchise, and there is no Paul Walker (pre-Running Scared) to drastically irritate the experience.",wolverine296,"Jul 9, 2006"
4,Woeful,"Superman IV: The Quest For Peace and Jaws IV: The Revenge are two movies considered to be so poor, they are thought to be ""Franchise Killers"".The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift or ""The Fast And The Furious 3"" for those that are counting should be known as a franchise killer. God knows it is worse than both Superman IV and Even Jaws IV. Plot In A Paragraph: Sean Boswell is an American teenager, he is a loner in school, however he challenges his rival for an illegal street racing, and he totals his car in the end of the race. To avoid time in prison he is sent to Tokyo to live with his father who is in the military. As soon as he arrives he discovers a new, fun but dangerous way of street racing in the underworld of the streets of Tokyo, Japan.Sung Kang is the only actor to emerge with any credit, as the acting is woeful all round. The cameo by Vin Deisel is the movies only bright spot.",slightlymad22,"Apr 2, 2015"
10,6/5,"I like the bit with the cars. it was really good. i liked the racing stripes on the cars. especially the red ones. it was so cool. i didn't like the blue ones because who likes blue anyway, right? anyway this film was so good that it was recorded in Tokyo because it is my second favourite place, below Ohio! i cant believe they make you write a review 10 lines long. seems like this film was written in less than 10 lines. car goes fast, people cheer, police chase, crash, dead people, then yeah. massive explosion awesome CGI, but hey ho guess people are stupid enough to believe that real explosions are orange not green. god, my hands hurt. why does this film exist? oh right because it was made in Tokyo, which is my favourite place behind Ohiooooo. I don't know about you but how is a car film a family favourite? god damn it. i hate this film but still i give it a 10 out of 10 for being in Tokyo.",liammapswaw,"Apr 30, 2015"
3,This movie was awful,"How do the movie makers convince the money men to send them to a place like Tokoyo and totally destroy a tried and true action series like F&F with big $$. The hero, can't get out of his way in a US public school, is supposed to be casted as white trailer trash, but then speaks fluent Japanese and attends a private school, for what army brats, and has no issues??. Magically, has absolutely no problem with driving on the wrong side of the road(just turned 18), and is allowed to destroy what $80,000 in autos belonging to a guy he just met? Pluease, The damsel in distress has the sex appeal of a small rock ( and I love pretty girls in school uniforms) and we are supposed to believe that she would ever deal with a local thug(s) who make their money how exactly (everyone is drinking soda). This should have been a R rating with tremendously sexy Japanese Girls and ADULTS making all the bad decisions. What did we learn? That it is OK to destroy hundreds of thousands of newly constructed homes in the USA, thousands of dollars worth of cars, with absolutely NO ramifications?. Oh yeah, and that you have to do fish tails around young Japaneses girls in their own hot cars to Just get their phone Number. TOO shallow, Too Unbelievable, and TOO typical a climax to the Movie. Daddy bails out misfit son, by just happening to have a old hot rod frame. I left as soon as Dad's garage opened up.",pfdoiron,"Jun 22, 2006"
9,Much better than Anticipated!,"I expected this time around it would be like most other sequels, when the main cast are no longer present, that it is a last ditch effort to milk a couple of more dollars out of the name. Was I wrong! It contained a well thought out and original storyline, and is bringing a virtually unknown type of racing into mainstream (unless you are a die-hard racer). I have known about drifting for years, but almost anyone I have mentioned it to have never heard of it.I am 33, and my father of 54 both thought that it likely had the some of the best car chases in movie history! Well thought out, very original and really nothing like the first 2. After 2 Fast 2 Furious turned out to be less than stellar, they have breathed new life into this nameplate, and really hope to see another installment. It has some extremely interesting twists which is totally surprising and welcomed.I am definitely recommending seeing this if you liked the first 2 at all!",JohnD-Keane,"Jun 15, 2006"
8,Great entertainment! A great step up for the series.,"This movie RULES.I honestly don't understand the people who hated it. Yes, there is a good deal of very poor acting. Yes, the story is pretty stupid. Yes, everything about this movie is contrived... but honestly, are any of these surprising? Did we not expect this? The fact is, this movie stands head and shoulders above 2 Fast, 2 Furious. I do not believe that is an opinion. The acting is better, the story is better, the characters are more believable, the production value is FAR better... none of these are stellar by any means, but what you end up with is solid entertainment. As long as you know what you're looking at, you will laugh, whether they meant you to or not.I'm not sure if I enjoyed it more than the first F&F, but it's definitely a fun movie. Don't go looking for something believable, and don't expect a deep, involving story -- just go to be entertained, and I can almost guarantee you'll at least get a good laugh.There are definitely negatives, though. The acting is not good. Not awful, but not good. The female lead looks like Michael Jackson. I mean dog ugly. The plot is very simple, and not exactly involving.The positives, obviously, are the details. The races are certainly fun to watch; a LOT of the really stupid things (like, well, all the dialogue) can be really entertaining as long as you're not taking them seriously. There's a lot of idiocy that car people will catch and laugh at -- my knowledge of auto mechanics is mediocre, but I still got some great laughs out of this film. E-brake drifting in RWD cars... if you get it, you'll enjoy it.Overall... watch this movie to be entertained. I'm not disappointed; I'm glad I saw it on the big screen, and once it's out on DVD, I will definitely be obtaining a copy.7.5/10",etzool,"Jun 24, 2006"
9,"This is what I wanted see, a film that lives up to its name Tokyo Drift. Nothing more, nothing less","I went to this film for one thing and one thing only to watch drift racing, I'm a rally fan and drifting is the coolest part of the rallies. This film is tagged as Tokyo Drift and lives up to its name. You want a good plot and a great story this ain't for you its that simple. Go to this film and watch some of the best driving sequences you have ever witnessed and you won't be disappointed. My rating of 9 out of 10 is for the races and thats about all. This is the best by far of the Fast and the Furious trilogy when it comes to the racing sequences, but as stated earlier I'm a drift fan. The special effects were good, and there is a interesting surprise at the end of the film, that makes me see a possible 4th film in the franchise.

10,It was H O T,"The movie was great. Although I do think that it was kind of loosely based on a bad attitude Initial D movie. But all in all it was definitely the best Fast and The Furious movie compared to it's predecessors. If Paramount is willing to make another one, they should definitely aim for something like this one. I was kind of getting sick and tired of the same Nitros powered vehicles / rims bigger than the door of their cars, and it's drivers wanting to just go straight and think that's the best. As humans (and street hood rat racers) we all know that ""in life"" it has it's path of ups and downs and lefts and rights, sharp curves, and hairpins or what not.

8,Fast and the Furious: Tokoyo Drift,"Fast, beautiful cars, sexy Asians, and fights....Does that interest you? Because that's what this movie is. Nothing else though since there is no plot.The plot is for some reason the main guy is moved to Tokoyo. In Tokoyo he meets a guy who shows him underground racing, there he is introduced to drifting. He tries racing and gets his ass handed to him. So for most of the movie he does pointless drifting and hitting on this guys girl. His uncle(that he lives with in Tokoyo) doesn't like him driving, but then he ends up letting him do the most dangerous race at the end.The acting alright. The emotion at times was bad, and the main character was absolutely dreadful. Yay, let's put a total hick with a huge accent as the main character and put him with a bunch of Chinese people who can only have two emotions. Mad and calm.The cars were beautiful, as were the girls that were bending over the cars. They choreography of the racing and stuff was very well done, and it looked quite real, so were the crashes.Overall the movie was pretty cool, but a bad plot, but I'd watch it again.",typhill,"Jun 25, 2006"
10,Earns the BS stamp of excellence,"Going into this movie, the third fast and the furious i expected a couple of things: 1. fast paced action 2. hot woman but what this installment gives you is that and a whole lot more. It has a deeper plot than the first two and dives deeper into the characters to let you know (or guess) what is happening or what is going to happen and on top of that it even gives you ""quoteable quotes"" to remember the movie by. I enjoyed the way the movie was shot referring to the showing of scenes and then aciton and then scenes but i don't want to give anything away. Other than that it is an excellent summer film that shows you a good time but even makes you think with a good story line and some inner twists. You are missing out by missing this film and that is why i give it the BS (my intials) stamp of excellence.",broccili_beans_3,"Jun 24, 2006"
10,my opinion,"I think this movie is great! English's foreign language to me so I apologize if there'll be some mistakes... Cars, girls, style, drift - that are the main things in the movie and I liked it very much. However, the movie's not just 'bout exterior, it's 'bout fight, 'bout finding one's way out, 'bout getting accustomed to a new environment, 'bout life. If you would have asked a racer or a drifter what a car means to him, he would have said - it's my life, it's my style, it's my everything, it's me, myself and I. A great movie! Really great! And I liked the ending very much too. The part when Vin Diesel came and said he wanna race... I can't wait to see the fourth part of the movie... I'm looking forward to see it.",roman-pelt,"Aug 30, 2006"
8,It is a very entertaining movie.,"OK, I walked in expecting another fake street racing movie. The first Fast and the Furious was quite entertaining. The second just felt like a 90 minute commercial sponsored by Mitsubishi and Yearone. Honestly, this movie was really great, it felt really good to watch. You can really connect with the main character(Lucas Black). I dunno, you can sense a lot of sincerity in his character. He loves what he does and thats it. The jump from drag to drifting doesn't seem to really get to him. The fact that this movie doesn't rely on the cars as the main characters is really great. The acting itself in this movie was wonderful. I love watching a good classic movie just like the rest, but sometimes you just need to see some mindless car scenes and unwind a bit. Oh, the other thing I loved was the cameos! We have the original drift king with his one liners. Funny. We also have the so ever popular Sonny Chiba(aka the swordsman from Kill Bill). Last and not least, Vin Diesel is back",jin_ecko72,"Jun 18, 2006"
9,Flashier version of it's predecessors,"""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" is the first two movies plus more. There's a new ""hero"", which is a nice change for some. The hero is supposedly 17, but it's pretty obvious he's actually much older in real life. =P His name is Sean, and he seems to get into trouble a lot. He's moved from town to town because of racing, and now he's gone to Tokyo, Japan. While there, he learns about a new kind of racing called ""drifting"". He makes a few new friends, and gets into it. This movie has LOTS of racing and some BAD ASS cars. If you liked the first two, you're going to LOVE this one.

The first one was great it had a great plot and story line, the second funny and good, and this one was pretty good as well.Hopefully when they make a 4th one they wont go down.

Only thing is I would of like to of seen Paul Walker and Lucas Black. Vin Diesel was a group pump at the end. To bad they didn't actually full out race and we as an audience didn't get to see it. I hope they make a movie off of that one.I would give anything to watch this movie over and over 24/ 7. This movie is definitely being bought. There is so much action it keeps you on your toes , especially the final race on the mountain.WAY INTENSE! I definitely don't like the way the Japanese do things though that's for sure. It's most like they need to cheat to win and such. The first race we see before he moves was so intense. My adrenaline was sky rocketed. Amazing stunts in there.

Lil Bow wow was total out of character reminded me too much of Tyrese in the way he talked. I didn't particularly like the accents on the leading female and leading male. Seemed a bit over board. My heart cried when the RX7 got destroyed as well as the Fairlady Though I personally think they should have used Paul Walker and bring back the Brian character back instead and have him reunite with Dom in the end and that would leave a opening for the fourth one where Brian and Dom roam the Toyko streets. Now if and when the fourth on comes out, man it'd going to be off the hook.",dmanero,"Jun 16, 2006"
8,tokyo drift,"The cast of the third movie, which has a different atmosphere than the first two series, includes new actors and new locations. First of all, the director of the series has changed again, Lucas Black plays the leading role, there are also prominent people in supporting roles, but I did not know anyone in the cast. Lucas Black's performance was okay, but he was too old to be a high school student under eighteen, D. K. He did justice to his evil character, but he was also very repulsive, the Han character was good. Unlike the first two films, the production takes place in Japan. Shaun, who had to go to Japan to his father because of a car race that ended in an accident at school, will try to establish himself here and beat the drift king. The movie starts with an average car race that starts with a trivial reason, and then moves on to the drift-filled nights of Tokyo. Although the script had no weight and was full of clichés, the racing scenes were very good, especially the chase before the finale and the final race were memorable, and both the Six Days and Tokyo Drift tracks were good, the other music was not bad either.",burakgezzginci,"Nov 27, 2023"
8,It's honestly underrated.,"**Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift** - A Thrilling Yet Underrated Gem""Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,"" the third installment in the high-octane franchise, is often overlooked and underrated. However, it stands out with its unique setting, distinct storyline, and engaging car culture that deserves an 8/10 rating for its sheer entertainment value and innovative approach to the racing genre.Set against the vibrant backdrop of Tokyo, the film immerses viewers in a world of underground drift racing, a subculture known for its precision and artistry. Unlike its predecessors, ""Tokyo Drift"" departs from the familiar characters and locations, offering a fresh perspective and introducing a new protagonist, Sean Boswell, played by Lucas Black. Sean's journey from a troubled teen in America to a drift-racing sensation in Japan forms the crux of the narrative.One of the film's most vital points is its authentic depiction of Tokyo's urban landscape and the intricacies of drift racing. The cinematography captures the city's neon-lit streets and bustling energy, creating a visually stunning experience. The racing scenes are meticulously choreographed, showcasing the skill and finesse required for drift racing. The film does a commendable job of making these sequences thrilling and immersive, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats.Lucas Black's portrayal of Sean is earnest and relatable, even if it lacks the charisma of some of the franchise's other leads. His character's growth and adaptation to a new culture add depth to the storyline. Sung Kang's Han Lue, a fan-favorite, brings a sense of cool and calm to the chaotic world of drift racing, and his mentorship of Sean adds a layer of camaraderie and heart to the film.The supporting cast, including Bow Wow as Twinkie, provides moments of fun and grounding in an otherwise high-stakes environment. The film's antagonist, Takashi, played by Brian Tee, embodies the typical rival but with a nuanced performance that adds complexity to his character. The dynamic between Sean and Takashi drives much of the film's tension, culminating in a gripping climax.""Tokyo Drift"" is not without its flaws. The storyline can sometimes be predictable, and some character arcs feel underdeveloped. However, these shortcomings are overshadowed by the film's strengths. The soundtrack, featuring a mix of hip-hop and electronic beats, complements the fast-paced action and enhances the viewing experience.What truly sets ""Tokyo Drift"" apart is its celebration of car culture. The attention to detail in the vehicles, from classic muscle cars to sleek Japanese imports, is impressive. The film pays homage to the art of car modification and the passion of racing enthusiasts, making it a must-watch for automotive lovers.In retrospect, ""Tokyo Drift"" has aged well, gaining appreciation for its bold departure from the main storyline and its focus on a different aspect of the racing world. It serves as a bridge in the franchise, introducing elements and characters that become pivotal in later films.In conclusion, ""Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" may not have garnered the initial acclaim of its predecessors, but it deserves recognition for its unique contribution to the franchise. Its exhilarating racing sequences, authentic depiction of Tokyo, and deep dive into drift culture make it an underrated gem that merits an 8/10 rating. Whether you're a fan of the series or new to street racing, ""Tokyo Drift"" offers an engaging and visually captivating ride that shouldn't be missed.",zzbvrfwk,"Jun 27, 2024"
10,Great movie,"I've seen both the previous fast and furious movies and loved them. I think this one is definitely as good. Although i do miss Paul Walker, Lucas Black is definitely a good replacement and being younger adds something to the movies. The actual car scenes aren't as good as 2 Fast 2 Furious, but the storyline and acting quality make up for it. Also, Neela (Nathalie Kelley), Sean's girlfriend is amazing, much better than Eva Mendes or Michelle Rodriguez. The soundtrack is really good, the tunes suit the Japanese drifting scene especially the Teriyaki Boys, an actual Japanese band who produced a track called ""fast and furious"". To sum it up plenty of comedy, action and thrills, i really enjoyed it.",simranbarn987,"Nov 16, 2006"
10,Drift into Excellence: The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006),"""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" isn't just a movie; it's a heart-pounding symphony of speed, style, and storytelling that earns every bit of its perfect score.

From the neon-drenched streets of Tokyo to the jaw-dropping drift races, this film is a cinematic masterpiece that hits all the right notes.What sets this film apart is its ability to reinvent the franchise while staying true to its roots. The introduction of a new protagonist, Sean Boswell (Lucas Black), brings a fresh perspective to the series, and his journey from outsider to drift king is both compelling and relatable.

Han's calm demeanor, sharp wit, and exceptional driving skills make him an instant favorite, adding depth and charm to the movie.The film's greatest strength lies in its mesmerizing depiction of the art of drifting. The drift races are not just action sequences; they are beautifully choreographed ballets of speed and precision.

The attention to detail in showcasing the cultural nuances of Tokyo adds authenticity to the film, making the city itself a character in this high-octane tale.The character development in ""Tokyo Drift"" is superb, allowing the audience to form genuine connections with the characters. Sean's evolution from a fish out of water to a skilled racer is inspiring, and his relationships with other characters are nuanced and heartfelt. The camaraderie between Sean and Han is particularly noteworthy, creating an emotional anchor that resonates throughout the film.Director Justin Lin's vision is brought to life with breathtaking visuals and expertly crafted action sequences. The film's editing is sharp and dynamic, enhancing the intensity of the races and the emotional impact of the story. The soundtrack, pulsating with energy, complements the on-screen action perfectly, creating an immersive experience that lingers long after the credits roll.In conclusion, ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" is a triumph of cinematic excellence. It not only delivers on the franchise's trademark adrenaline-fueled action but also presents a compelling story filled with memorable characters.

8,worth it for the last 2 minutes.........,"all i can say is that the making of a #3 after a horrible #2 was worth it just to see the last 2 minutes...Everyone was ""like how can they make a #3... "" but it was worth it to see the cars, the action and a little fun. unlike the first two which focused on the people and their stories this one had the drama.... car crash after car crash. I think at the end you prayed you wouldn't wreck your car like that.I also love that like the others it had an awesome soundtrack.I do recommend the film to any one who wants some mindless fun entertainment.",bluesweetee,"Jun 26, 2006"

9,like a cigarette commercial,"I like it. And I don't need to write much to state why, because NFS, er, Tokyo Drift is a nice simple movie. It's about car racing - merged with every stylish and attractive means you can possibly get and polished to the aesthetic quality of cigarette commercials. Even the ""story"" is contributing to the whole, when set in the right perspective: It's just another color on the canvas, some ""manly"" simple metaphors on life to complete the picture of what you can dream about the speed and the car racing.Another nice consequence of Tokyo Drift having something in common with cigarette commercials: As you like cigarette commercials without being interested in the content, you don't have to like car racing, to be able to like the movie.All in all it's not perfect, but I think it's great and a good example of how to get something out of great looking scenes and pictures (and girls) without becoming artistic boredom.",patrick_ok,"Jul 14, 2006"

8,The fast and the furious Tokyo drift,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) in my opinion I think is a solid good action sequel, a very bashed and hated in the series. Which I don't think this movie is bad, I think is a much better movie than Furious 7. I always loved this movie, I think it is a good movie, but in the series is not the worst one, but is far from worst one that would be Furious 7. I think it was a different solid, good sequel in the series and I love it for an action film. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a fun movie to watch: it accomplishes what it set out to do and that's provide the most realistic yet gravity-defying racing sequences, backed with the eye-catching background of the electrifying, neon Tokyo. Plot-wise it suffers a bit and the acting isn't top-notch, otherwise the loud music, import cars, cityscape Tokyo, and Japanese pop culture more than make up for the flaws of the film that you'll watch it again and again.Plot: When convicted street racer Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) tries to start a new life on the other side of the world, his obsession with racing sets him on a collision course with the Japanese underworld. To survive, he will have to master drifting-a new style of racing where tricked-out cars slide through hairpin turns, defying gravity and death for the ultimate road rush.This movie is more the highest-octane installment of the hit movie franchise built for speed! There are more mind-blowing stunts and heart-pounding racing sequences than ever, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift will put you in the driver's seat. ""Strap yourself in for a blistering, super-charged ride.""-- Pete Hammond, Maxim"" The CGI I am sorry but in one way it is terrible which I really did not like when Sean (Lucas Black) and Neela (Nathalie Kelley) are slide down with the car during the car chase and they cross over the crowd of people without hitting anyone, you can see the camera, that it is made with a CGI that is the only main problem I have with the film, the rest was okay. This is a very simple film, not a big confusing plot and again this films, you know 5,6 and 7 the plots are still pretty simplistic.5 was a heist movie, 6 was this guy the evil version of you, we want him to bring him down simple.7 you killed this guy's brother, he is looking for revenge and he also try's to kill you so you get this, simple movie not complicate at all. That is one thing that this movies get right constantly.The racing in this movie: I think they did a better job than in 2, because I didn't noticed more of a CGI, because that's how they just do it now, a lot of wide shot you can tell there was a lot of practical stunt drive, it look good which I enjoyed that. I know a lot of people will put this movie lover down and I think it is a solid movie and a solid flick. This is the first time Brian Tyler made the score and this is also the first one that Justin Lin directed, he went later directing three next movies 4,5 and 6 which I love to death. I thought the direction is good, I like the resolves on the end of the movie, the sound track is good, I did not mind the cast you know. Lucas Black is the lead in this movie. Sonny Chiba is in this movie I always like the actor. This was Sung Kang's first introduction of his character Han who later appeared in 4 as a cameo, than in 5 and 6 as regular cast. Vin Diesel did returned with his character Dominic Toretto, who made a cameo scene on the end of the movie, which I thought was pretty cool. Bow Wow I didn't mind him in this movie and Nathalie Kelley was extremely hot and I really though she was much better sexy babe, than Eva Mendes was in 2 Fast 2 Furious. Nathalie Kelley lights up the screen as Neela and I would welcome her return to the series any time.Overall: Tokyo Drift gets a solid 8 by me it does lacks on the great characters and the cast of the first two movies in the series, but is redeemed by Han, awesome car scenes and a pounding score from Brian Tyler. I have enjoyed this movie and I",dilipbts,"Jun 10, 2020"

10,Much better than 2fast,This movie was far better than 2fast 2furious. Thankfully the ditched the tired storyline of an undercover cop in this one. This time around it's about a kid that just wants to race. The plot isn't amazing but at least its fresh and not the same tired movie with new race scenes.(2fast 2furious). The movie gets off to a banging start with a race with in the first five minutes. The racing scenes in this one are the best of the series. I thought the characters in this movie were great too. While not as gritty and mean as the characters from the previous movies they do stand out well. I especially liked bow wows character. So basically if you liked the first movie or even the second then you should love this one. I don't know why some people are giving it bad reviews and scores. But If you like fast cars then this is definitely a movie for you.,bobeatsrice,"Jun 20, 2006"
8,"Interesting, highly stylized movie","I first watched this movie while waiting for a problem with an old car I had to be fixed in a big auto-repair shop. They had this client area with a flat screen where Tokyo Drift was rolling.I am not a ""fast and furious"" fan. Definitely. But...But the way this movie was shot, the camera angles and movements, the music, the scenes, the Asian actors performance - all this compelled me to watch a movie in an auto-repair shop (a first, indeed), and on top of that, a movie which had started 15 minutes earlier or so.Of course, by the time the problem with the car was fixed, I took off - I didn't get to watch it to the end.I purchased a DVD copy of Tokyo Drift some 11 months later.This is not a John Woo-imitator movie - you know, these John Woo wannabes that think buckets of blood, gun shots and lightning-fast punches and kicks is all there is to it.No, actually, for the most part this movie is...calm. Philosophical. A brief take-a-look-and-see into the Japanese drift phenomenon, with its glitter, powerful engine sounds, stylish clothing, and a almost-gaijin kind of attitude of Japanese youth.The plot is simple, with a few clichés thrown in, the kind of plot that makes one wonder why do they spend millions of dollars on a movie ""powered"" by it. BUT...BUT plot is, surprisingly, only a small element, something that brings together the characters and makes up the scenes where they breath and live.The acting is good, the soundtrack is very appropriate if not excellent.The directing is FIRST RATE. It brings all the elements together. Calmly, elegantly, honestly, and in such a way as to actually lend credibility to the characters actions and fates.The slow movements are reminiscent of the Best Anime tradition, and the dialogs (though simple), together with the soundtrack and camera angles/position, calmly rocky you into thinking about what it would be like to simply enjoy driving, drifting, through the night, alone or with someone by your side.I enjoyed it. What else can one ask of a movie?",Chronus,"Jun 15, 2009"
10,ace!,this film was top had everything i love all rolled into one nice cars! evil villains a love match and a top notch accent from 'Sean'! a truly great film u must see it! its that good i went 2 see it twice at the cinema! also there is a sad part of the movie that brings the reality's of driving like a maniac straight to real like the death of poor poor hon and i really liked him! :( very sad!

8,Tokyo Saves Cliché Theme,"Tokyo Saves Cliché Theme Maybe being Asian American gives me a thrill from finally seeing Asian teens laugh at the white kids and beat up the token black guy in high school.The acting is bad, the premise unbelievable, the plot predicable, the characters tokens, but some how the great city of Tokyo saves the whole picture. Much like the city of Osaka in 'Black Rain' the city isn't just the set. It's the main character.There's also plenty of action and much more focus on the racing scenes than the boring character. This is a good thing. The character simply exist because someone needs to drive the cars. (of course the ""actors"" don't actually drive the cars the stunt drivers do.) But every story needs a hero, a villain, a damsel in distress, and a token black friend.Actually this film deserves a lot of credit for picking up on the Japanese art of drag ""drift"" racing. It's been around for over 30 years in Japanese pop culture.""Drift"" racing resulted from the many winding roads in Japanese roads and involves the car gliding into a 90 degree turn rather than slowing down to turn.The plot: Poor Southern teenager Sean just gets in trouble everywhere he goes. Inevitably rich kids make fun of him which results in a drag race. But after Sean's third strike he's sent to live with his military father serving in Tokyo.Thus the old fish out of water cliché. Although this time it's funnier, since they make fun of Japanese pop culture, like not wearing shoes in school. Unfortunately there's not enough of it.Sean is sent to regular Japanese high school. Hardly believable since he doesn't even speak Japanese! And since American military families are usually provided with English schools for ""army brats."" Sean predictably makes friends with the token black guy and the hot Australian girl whose boyfriend is the Yakuza villain.Even more predictably Sean's forbidden romance puts him in the middle of rival Yakuza drift racing gangs.The most unbelievable scene is where Sean's father says, ""That's it. You're on a plane tonight."" but relents and agrees to let his son enter a dangerous illegal drift race against the Yakuza. WTF!!! As I said, don't try and take this film too seriously or you'll go mad. Just enjoy the fast and furious city of Tokyo.",chow913,"Nov 26, 2011"
10,Tokyo Drift will make you drool on yourself.,"If your a big fan of the series like I am, you got to see this movie.First off, the movie stars Lucas Black(Shawn Boswell)who gets in trouble back home and is forced to move to Toyko to live with his dad to avoid jail time.+ The sound effects are awesome, whether it's shifting gears, or hearing the rubber burn off the tires as they drift down the hill, believe me, you will hear the noise. + The music is good especially because it fits in with the whole theme. It seems to me its some kindof Japanese music which is self-explanatory. + The plot was great in my opinion is one of the best action movies of the year! If you want action, and you love the franchise, then you have to see this. You'll be surprised at the end of who shows up. + Not only do you get action, but a little comedy in there. I laughed pretty hard at some of the things Shawn would say. It seems to me that some parts of the movies were dragged out. They could have left some scenes out but overall nothing else is bad about the movie. Hope you like the movie.",ADPollock1188,"Jul 5, 2006"
8,An action flick that thrives on its unique style and cinematography,"As a loyal fan to modified cars, I very much enjoyed watching The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift and would highly recommend it. I feel that this movie successfully differentiated itself from the other two movies in the franchise to create a new ""Fast-paced"" viewing experience as well as highlight the directors style. Despite views from critics, I hold this movie in high regards for what it has, rather than what it lacks in the acting and storyline department.What I most enjoyed about this movie was its perspective, and style utilized in displaying the action. Not only did it use unique camera angles and cinematography, the techniques and devices in general were well suited to the location and essence that the movie delivers. It is set in Tokyo, where fast cars, latest fashion, and state-of-the-art gadgets are abundant. To compliment this, my favorite cinematography device was the camera shots through the mobile phones. Personally I found that worked exceptionally well, and made for some great eye candy.I pity all critics that denote this movie in terms of acting, plot etc. What they seem to understand is that this sort of movie criteria is important and must be executed. What they don't understand is that this movie criteria is unessential for this genre of movie. Any survey done on behalf of this movie will prove that viewers of this action genre, come to see action and great visuals, rather than big name actors and intellectually challenging plots.I give this movie a generous 7/10 simply because i felt the action was unique, which included never before seen cinematography. Critics can say what they may about the acting, or the storyline, yet it is important to realize that this criteria was executed adequately, and that the movie was successful in delivering a great viewing experience.",EdwinTetlow141,"Jul 7, 2006"
10,Underrated Movie Gem (11/10),"I really cannot state enough how much overhated this movie was back in the day and actually still is, one reason being that (Tokyo Drift) actually is The Fast & Furious film to follow the street racing format the most, while it also is one of the most realistic F&F films and it also have some of the best, most intense and most believable acting in the whole franchise, Though these reasons a not actually the reasons that I really believe that this movie doesn't get the love it deserves. No, what I really believe makes Tokyo Drift stand out is that how perfect the cast is and how nearly every actor in Tokyo Drift compliments each other in so many ways and gives it so much more believability, and really just makes it the best action movie having the aspect of cars, love and friendship being put so perfectly together giving you A Racing film which fits Don Torreto's way of thinking way better than the mainline F&F movies about what family is and how we as humans have to stand together with those who have helped us through life!!",RealCJHopkins,"Nov 2, 2024"
9,Definite Improvement Over the First Two Films,"Being an automotive enthusiast, (and a movie buff) for over 10 years now, I've always been one of the first in line to see the F and F movies when they came out. This movie was no exception. However, after being disappointed with the first two films, I didn't expect much from this third installment. The first two films satisfied my need for hot cars, women, and so-so action scenes, but I felt that the acting, dialog, and story lines were very thin and boring. F and F Tokyo Drift was much better than I had anticipated. It seems that the director (Justin Lin) actually concentrated more on the acting skill of the actors and dramatic aspects of the film, than he did on showing off the cars. That's where the first two installments fell short. It was also great to see the drift culture in this film, in addition to the show and drag-race culture that we were exposed to in the first two films. I've never been to Japan, but from what I have experienced in the U.S., I felt that the film did a pretty good job of depicting the key elements of the drift culture to the audience. Of course there were a few of the usual over-the-top stunts and scenes, but it's to be expected in a Hollywood picture. If it were exactly true to life, it would just be a documentary. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised and entertained, and I think that if you even somewhat enjoyed the first two, you will definitely love F and F Tokyo Drift. Even if you're not into cars and/or the whole tuner culture, the movie is still entertaining and a fun ride.",dchampagne-2,"Jun 21, 2006"
8,Does what you expect,"Alright, let's get this out of the way: if you have no interest in cars, don't bother. If you want moving, powerful acting performances, look elsewhere. If blow-off valves and spinning tires make your heart shift into high gear, this is your kind of movie. The story is wafer-thin, it serves only as a hasty explanation to bring the audience to the Tokyo location and set up some action addicted races. The acting is just decent enough to keep you from groaning constantly, though Sung Kang's role as Han stands out as memorable and pleasant. Lucas Black has an understated quality about him that I think allows the movie's merit of its stunt sequences to shine, rather than the lead trying to steal all the attention. Which leaves me with the car play--the writers thankfully stopped trying to be technical and accurate in terms or facts (for the most part), so there's no ""...Blow the welds on your intake..."" crap, which is just plain wrong. The stunt drivers delivered lots of jaw-dropping drifts and high octane chases, and Justin Lin and his second-unit director took great care in highlighting the automotive lunacy. The cars and the setting are all glossy and colorful, and there is a wide range of makes and models to drool over, all just a bit over the top in their appearance. The music matches the speed of the movie as well, getting the target audience fired up with rock, hip-hop, and electronic tracks in all the right spots. Simply put, this movie offers what it promises, and gets by on the rest. I'm one of those types who can look past the shortcomings for the vehicular excitement, so I loved it, despite the flaws.",carlsob,"Jun 19, 2006"
8,A Different Concept for Fast and Furious Series,"Tokyo Drift is a movie that brought a different concept to the Fast and the Furious Series. Previous films had ten-second speed races on the straight track. In Tokyo drift, races are not like that, the main thing is not to be fast, but to finish the race by doing good drifting on sweeping roads.It offers a different style to the audience as cars. We got used to classic American cars from previous movies. The audience also had the opportunity to watch Asian cars in this movie. There are plenty of racing scenes in the movie. It saturates the audience with races and action.The film generally focuses on Han. In the 6th film of the series, he talks about his life in Tokyo after Han decided to return to Tokyo.My favorite scene in the movie is the scene between Han and Sean on a balcony. There is a message about life here. I like that it contains messages about life in movies. The surprise at the end of the movie was nice, but I wish they didn't finish the race without showing who won.Having erotic scenes in the movie was not good in terms of the movie. I especially learned from the sex scene of two girls. I have never admitted having obscene scenes in movies.",drmuhammedsamiduru,"Apr 22, 2020"

10,Tokyo drift,"Love this movie , this is the one actually about the cars and car racing and not drugs, guns and whatever else , where you are not sure if your watching the war or what. It is good to see new faces , seeing all the same ones except Paul's while he was still here is annoying and boring, especially one of vin diesel. I thought actors were pretty good, at least main ones were really into their role , DK didn't even have to say anything he looked mean enough. Han he was sort of cool guy just sitting in background, and Sean was really into his role of learning how to drift. Neela is really pretty, prettier than other girls from the series. Loved that it actually touched on reality of car drifting and portrayed real drift king.",jovanar-75708,"Aug 6, 2020"
9,Was much better than 2Fast 2Furious but with small flaws...,"I thought that the movie was awesome. However, there were some minor set backs which made me think ""now that is stupid"". To start off, I thought that Bow Wow should not have been in the movie, but he did do a good job. I just think it is stupid that they had to get someone famous like that for that part... Another thing...Shawn Boswell was a great actor but his country southern accent seemed too fake. It seemed like he was 'trying to hard' if you know what I mean. Last thing for now...Vin Diesel's appearance was not needed. It was just really stupid how he just showed up for 10 seconds! Anyways, to make a review short, it is a great movie and you should see it if you liked (or didn't!) the first or second Fast and Furious.",FlyersPh9,"Jun 18, 2006"
10,"a nice change for the franchise, something different",I was a big fan of the franchise before this came out and I thought I was going to hate it but it actually turned out to be pretty good and lived up to the hype of other Fast And Furious films. I really liked the concept of drifting in this one and the fact that it takes place in Tokyo is pretty interesting. This version has all new characters so you won't be seeing Brian or any of the old cast until the next film. What is pretty cool about this is that they made fast and the furious 4 a prequel to tokyo drift so really number 4 is taking place before tokyo drift in the story. It ties into place with one or two characters for the next film. Plenty of sexy Japanese cars and hot girls in this film so of course that never changes. Out of all of them this is one of my favourites.,miketaylor2007,"May 6, 2010"

It seems that I need to write ten lines of text to meet the submission guidelines for these reviews, but I've already said what I want to say about the movie.

9,A different world,"""Fast & Furious 3: Tokyo Drift"", the third installment in the franchise, shines brightly with its unique approach to the series. The film takes a daring leap by shifting its setting to Tokyo and introducing a new protagonist, Sean Boswell, portrayed by Lucas Black. This change of pace infuses the series with a fresh burst of energy, showcasing the fusion of American car culture with Japanese drifting techniques.The movie's greatest strength lies in its breathtaking racing sequences. The art of drifting takes center stage, transforming car chases into mesmerizing dances of controlled chaos. Director Justin Lin's keen eye for dynamic camerawork captures the essence of these moments, allowing viewers to feel the adrenaline rush as they immerse themselves in the high-speed world of Tokyo street racing.Tokyo itself becomes a character, with its neon-lit streets and pulsating nightlife forming a vivid backdrop for the story. The film's ability to transport audiences to a completely different culture while maintaining the essence of the series is commendable. The music, a mix of hip-hop and electronic beats, complements the fast-paced visuals perfectly, elevating the overall experience.However, amidst these positives, some aspects falter. The absence of series regulars like Vin Diesel and Paul Walker is noticeable and their absence creates a void that even Tokyo's vibrant energy struggles to fill. Lucas Black's portrayal of Sean lacks the charisma and depth of his predecessors, which sometimes makes it difficult to fully invest in his journey.In conclusion, ""Fast & Furious 3: Tokyo Drift"" stands as a bold departure from the franchise's formula, exploring new territories and introducing viewers to a different facet of the car culture. Its stunning racing scenes, immersive setting, and eclectic soundtrack make it a standout entry. Yet, the absence of familiar faces and a slightly weaker lead performance are notable drawbacks. Despite these minor shortcomings, the film successfully rejuvenates the series and remains a memorable chapter for fans and newcomers alike.",uhudsavascisi,"Aug 18, 2023"

But the troublesome kid inside him takes over and soon he is tangled up in illegal street racing, guys that don't like him for being a gaijin (foreigner), he gets to cross the local Yakuza boss' nephew and to make everything straight again, he needs to learn how to drift..FNF Tokyo Drift is by far the best of the 3. Where the first one gets a lot of respect for doing a movie on the subject of illegal street racing, the second in the series was a major drop. Bad acting, bad plot, bad computer generated visual effects and the list can continue. No-one expected very much from the third movie. No really known actors no block buster names. Maybe that is the reason for this being the best movie of the 3. Or maybe it is just the awesome drifting stunts being performed that will keep you sitting on the edge of your seat throughout the movie.The most interesting thing is that this movie has a buildup just like a old Kung-Fu movie. The unknown hero enters a city, gets in a brawl and crosses the local bad guy. His goons beat him up and through him out to die. The young hero finds a monk that show him the mysterious drifting dragon kick (or some other crappy trick) and our hero returns and beat the crap out of the bad guy. Its fun to see how this simple form of tale-telling still works very good on film.FNF Tokyo Drift with a brand new cast does the work, and you are most certainly entertained.",r_uldal,"Aug 31, 2006"
8,I expected at worse but it is nice movie of the franchise,"After have watched the two movies of the franchise I expected a new character very bad and not interesting and a story very bad about it, well not I was completely I was hooked all the way through because the story is very nice and all of cast for the nice part or the bad guys was great they came out on top !!The two protagonist miss at the franchise okay but for this movie without them with new character it was very nice the movie stay anyway still interesting and entertaining is that we expected us as an audience !This third movie is the most stand out of the two prequels maked before, and that important cause the secondary movie was annoying this one, this third not at all !The script and directing is very nice.",tomlaju,"Apr 21, 2024"

8,It was better than the second one but not as good as the first,OK this is for the comment above about the navy brat ! For a start neither of them was a navy brat. Shaun was sent to Tokyo to avoid going to jail back in the states. I agree that the plot was rather terrible but apart from that it was good. Japs invented drifting so i think you are wrong mate. The only thing that was wrong with this film was that it didn't have a wide enough range of cars that it could of done like the previous ones. All you saw was 350 z and a skyline now and then. Don't get me wrong the s15 (which was actually a s13 that had been converted) was rather nice but a bit pathetic when he opened the hood and you saw the s13 engine ha ha. The Evo was rather nice and the Rx7. What was with Bow Wows car man. WTF Wat that ha ha. Rite mess. But overall worth watching. I personally think they could have done a better job or maybe even relate it to the previous ones. But no they had to do this. Ah well was disappointed but like I've said definitely worth watching.,zoe_loves_richard,"Jun 20, 2006"
10,Beautiful Film,"At first, I wasn't sure how Justin Lin could pull off the whole drifting scene and make a story out of it. I went in with high hopes and left even happier. Lucas Black has another great performance in another great film. He has a bright future ahead of him. Every racing sequence in this film is amazingly done and is all real. In the first two films, you could notice that the racing sequences were all done on a computer. Here, you can tell it's really happening. I highly recommend that the car lovers should go see this film. Especially if you love drifting. I'm a fan of all types of racing and I loved this film. I know I'll be making another trip back to see it. Also, the first racing sequence is AMAZING. It's pretty accurate to how a race could start. I give this film, a 9 out of 10.",fenderbass2122,"Jun 17, 2006"

9,Tokoyo!!!!!!!!!!,"Okay I have avoided this film for so long.Today I finally decided I was going to watch it so I sat watching this and I was so surprised to see the lead actor who I had previously watched on a TV movie called Flash.Lucas Black straight away caught my attention I never noticed him on the adverts or posters but I was captured the moment he hit the screen.This film is a high octane fuelled bomb the characters I felt were more deeper in this movie then the previous movies I have to say 2 was terrible but the third instalment definitely captures what the first started.Hot girls, Hot girls and Hot girls and high performance cars.The only thing I found a bit ridiculous was how the main character Sean was attracted to the girl who was already with someone, he was surrounded by beautiful women on every corner and yet he chose the one that was already taken.Vin Diseal's appearance was also a perfect finishing touch and I thought this film possibly could be better then the first.",Angelus2,"May 31, 2007"

9,Better than the others,"I have to say, the movie was definitely better than the trailer. That's a rarity nowadays. This movie had action from start to finish. I couldn't and didn't even get up to use the restroom!! The movie had gorgeous guys, beautiful girls and off the hook music. That's the way it is with racing in the real world. The plot was realistic. It had enough to keep the movie goer watching. The cars were off...the...hook...!! And last but definitely not least...the end of the movie..the best part of the whole movie. When they tell Sean he has someone who wants to race him and they show that car with the sound system blasting the best Don Omar song in the streets right now...crazy!!!! And the driver? Man please, this flick was off da meter....",marisela537,"Jun 20, 2006"
8,Best movie of the series,Tokyo drift was something different from the other movies of the series. Having a relatively unknown star-cast devoid of any superstars actually worked in favor of this movie. There was not much technology used here for planning a robbery or saving the world like the others. This movie gave a good introduction about drift racing especially on mountains like it has been shown in various video games as well. I would highly recommend this movie for a car racing as well as racing video games fans.,hemil_3000,"Feb 4, 2020"

8,Surprised,"I wandered into the theater to see Tokyo Drift as a time killer. Being a lover of all things Asian, I wasn't expecting much, but to my surprise, I really enjoyed the film. I had seen the original Fast and the Furious and found it passable entertainment and really didn't expect much from a second sequel, but this film really has heart, perhaps due to the many female production people listed in the credits.Lucas Black is Sean Boswell,a teen-aged racing fanatic who finds himself banished to the care of his father in Tokyo, Japan when his luck runs out with the law at home. Trying to fit into an alien culture, Sean finds himself falling into the illegal racing culture. A bad race lands him in servitude to a top racer who becomes a mentor. With a new girlfriend things are going well for Sean except that Han, his mentor is partners with a low level Yakuza underling who holds sway over his girlfriend Neela. Betrayal leads to murder and revenge culminating in a final nighttime race down a mountainside.While not a great script, the story held my attention throughout. Indeed, some of the Japanese school scenes suggest interesting possibilities for an entirely separate film. This is not a film about acting, but Lucas Black holds his own against the lovingly photographed cars. The other local performers all did well and as usual the Asian with blond hair is always a bad guy and why couldn't a Japanese actress be found to play the love interest?",Mark-129,"Jun 22, 2006"
10,already a classic,"The underdog story, the fact lucas black plays sean boswell as a outsider who loves cars but dont belongs anywhere but try to be part of tokyo, and how sung kang becomes his mentor.this movie is a classic, not only han becomes one of the coolest guys in the furious universe, sean boswell here is the underdog we all know that loves cars but needs to learn more about life , and the movie is the best you can expect. Not only is at some point nearly philosophical, also is about a gang of outsiders that found themselves being the important people at the end.",Cinema2kMendoza,"Sep 20, 2021"
9,Overall Tokyo Drift Was Another Banger For Me!,"Tokyo Drift is bringing back the more serious theme in the franchise after the pretty much light hearted 2 Fast 2 Furious, Lucas Black as the Paul Walker in this one, and Sung Kang as the Vin Diesel in this one, Sean and Han was basically the friendly bond version of Brian and Dom, Brian Tee as D. K. is a very convincing bad guy, he was great, and just like the previous movie, Tokyo Drift also fills with great badass exciting loud action sequence, great music, and the story in this one is so far the purest race car story in the franchise, added with a strong friendship elements in it, overall Tokyo Drift was another banger for me!",HabibieHakim123,"Mar 17, 2023"
9,"Yes, it was Fast and Yes, it was furious","Lets be honest here, if you arrive at the cinema expecting an intelligent meaningful storyline you will be sorely disappointed. Tokyo Drift was produced for those among us who are car fanatics or adrenaline junkies. This sequel has thrown the most impressively modified cars to date and it has not disappointed its loyal fans. I was impressed to see the mistakes from the 2nd sequel have not been repeated. For the most part, the driving stunts were actually done by the professional drifting team from Japan, not so much computer generated junk. For those of us who were eagerly awaiting the next level of customized cars, the 350Z and the RX-7 lived up to expectations. The only aspect of the film that bothered me was the southern accent of the American. It was just too blatant...So for those who needed to see a film surrounding some incredible driving techniques it was a masterpiece! If however you were seeking to be enlightened by the storyline you should have stayed in the parking lot.",demon-drifter,"Feb 9, 2007"
10,And we live in To-Ki-Yo,"Great movie, I actually liked it the best out of the three films. Really animated jokes, great stunts, and one of the things I liked best is how true they kept the Japanese element, with the high school and other cultural differences.The ten second appearance of Vin Diesal only made it that much better, and honestly, The movie pulled me into it's world so much that I wanted nothing more then to go try my hand at drifting :) and hopefully not die from the experience.Another delight was the fact that Bow Wow is actually an Actor! Something that with everyone in Hollywood trying every job I as very Skeptical of, and yet he did it amazingly, Great Job all around to the cast!",EchosSorrow04,"Jul 6, 2006"

9,Tokyo drift,this film was a bit like fast and furious 1 because on number 1 Paul walker owed Vin Diesel a car and on Tokyo drift Shaun owed Han a car. but Tokyo drift was a wicked film best 1 so far there was some nice cars on it and the best bit was when Han and Shaun where getting chased by D.K and one of the funniest parts was at the beginning when Shaun was in the police station watching the CCTV of the race and he done the jump and he asked for a copy that was funny as f**k. but all in all it was a good film. twinkles car was really smart and it was weird because the wheels on Shauns red Mitsubishi evolution VIII are the same wheels as what my friend has on his car. it made me laugh when the fisherman was sitting there saying Shaun cant drift it was a little funny.,grantjf15,"Jan 25, 2007"
8,Best of the Series. Fight Me.,"This movie is crazy fun. Justin Lin is a perfect fit for this franchise, and the way he shoots the drifting scenes gives us maybe the best-looking car action in the whole franchise. Best of all, it gives us the coolest character in the franchise: Han. He single-handedly expands the way the series treats the role of the ""alpha male"", something if Hobbs and Shaw is much too insecure and stupid to tackle or understand.",matthewssilverhammer,"Nov 5, 2019"
9,Drop your preconceptions and judge this movie on its own merits,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I have seen the other two in the franchise, and I thought the second one sucked. I had better hopes for this one simply based on the location in Tokyo, which I think is the most fascinating city in the world. I wanted to watch the movie just to see images of the city. If the movie happened to be decent, well then that would just be a bonus. Boy was I pleasantly surprised at how good this film was! This movie is pure entertainment. The cinematography is gorgeous, and really reveals Tokyo as a futuristic city. The racing scenes are amazing. The character development is there, and you actually are intrigued by the main characters. There is plenty of eye candy to go around. I was gripped the whole time by this movie. Even if you didn't like the other F&F movies, I think you should give this one a chance. It definitely has more depth to it than the others.",bthuynh,"Jun 19, 2006"
10,On par with the original f&f,"before you go see this movie, some things you should know beforehand: if you are not into cars, exotic women, drifting, and male Asian actors that are clueless about kung-fu, then this movie may not be for you, much like only baseball fans would really wanna see a movie about baseball.with that being stated, this movie is on par with the first f&f movie. expect to see the similar storyline, acting, inside jokes (if you're into drifting), and of course, lots of modified cars and exotic women. this movie is a fun-filled roller coaster ride, and although it's not of a really high caliber, the movie is never boring. director lin was probably the most suitable for creating the third f&f movie because the movie clearly portrays that Asian American actors are more than just kung-fu fighters, and that is refreshing. movies like this should hopefully gear towards representing Asian American actors as color-blind main characters of mainstream movies in the near future. sung kang was not only awesome to watch, but his character was a breakthrough in a typical role given to Asian American actors in the history of acting, for i do not remember the last time there ever was a native English speaking male Asian American actor playing a major role (pardon my long description) in a movie who doesn't do martial arts.if you are comfortable with movies about cars, women, and lots of action, definitely go see this movie. if not, then this movie probably is not for you.",jermko06,"Jul 15, 2006"
8,Awesome Franchise Showing off JDM Style,"I have been watching the franchise since the beginning and besides the stunts getting crazier it is still well worth the movie ticket, popcorn and Coke.This movie is No exception and the cars are amazing. Love the JDM cars and this delivers over and over.Awesome movie.",Kelford-Cams,"Apr 4, 2022"
9,"trashy, terrible acting, and gratuitous t and a. sign me up.","writing a meaningful review of this movie is akin to searching for a deeper, philosophical message in a Jenna Jameson movie. IE, you can't because both movies are porn, ie one is real porn and the other is car porn. And thats what made this installment of Fast and the Furious absolutely worth my time. Acting, deplorable, writing terrible, main character's accent, corny (i thought he was making it up the entire time but he is from alabama and talks like that in the out takes also). what did this movie offer, sweet street scenes from japan, hot girls in ridiculous outfit, and over the top driving stunts on par with MI 2 and the Bourne Supremacy. Yeah there was a lot of green screen CGI stuff also but enough real driving to make the movie worthwhile. so in a nut shell, if you are under 40, like video games, anime culture, or were a fan of the dukes of hazard TV show, you will probably like this movie too. turn you brain off for a hour and a half and enjoy.",pdxtex,"Oct 5, 2006"
10,what this film should be judged on,This is first and foremost an action film you do not watch it for the characters and story you watch it for the action and for the thrills and in this aspect the fast and furious tokyo drift definitely delivers. The action scenes have a real sense of speed. They also give you a real sense of danger and you never know what is coming next.It also contains some very nice cars i am not really into the Japanese tuning seen but this film contains every kind of car from nissans to mustangs to volkswagens there really is something for everyone!In conclusion if you want a film with in depth story and characters look elsewhere but if you want a good thrilling action movie then the fast and the furious tokyo drift is certainly worth watching.,gavin_2003,"Jun 19, 2006"
9,So much better than the last two.,"Finally, a F&F where cops are not involved. As a girl I'm tired of seeing car movies where they are always running from the cops. Another added feature, you didn't have to look at the monotone expression of Paul Walker for two hours. Lucas Black is a good addition to the movie as well as the Japanese setting. Han was a great character and they picked an excellent actor. This is something to note about the movie, each actor has a very definitive voice. This makes it much more verbally entertaining. While movies like these usually contain a lot of ""fromage"", the only really corny parts are in the very beginning with the blond girl and the guy from home improvement. Otherwise very entertaining and looking forward to a fourth.",jcemoney,"Jul 16, 2006"
10,I love it,"It's able to balance the great direction of the last 2 films with some lighthearted humor, and the lead is one of the best in the franchise, he guides you along his journey from the start to the very end.",asherrbh_15,"May 6, 2021"
8,Stylish and exciting,"I was pleasantly surprised when i saw ""fast and the furious"" today. After a lackluster effort in the second movie, a new energy was injected into the series with ""Tokyo Drift"" I found that in ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" the people involved in creating the movie were scared of smashing up the cars too much. In races people would not bump into other cars, but would rather sit behind them trying to be menacing. The action also seemed to occur off the racecourse, instead of on, which is more characteristic of car movies.But enough of ""2 Fast 2 Furious"". On to ""Tokyo Drift"". This movie has just nothing to the previous movies in the series apart from racing and a cameo at the end of the movie. Many people will know that no characters from the last movie have been carried over into ""Tokyo Drift"". Instead of having a cop, the new main character is from the other side of the tracks and very early in the film it is established that he has a history of reckless driving.Don't expect too much from the storyline, it's very linear. There aren't any real big shocks. But this simplicity isn't important. What hooks you in is the style it is done with. The races are all exciting, even when you know who will win - as is the case with a race early in the film. Of course, as this film is all about drifting, there is an added danger. Car damage is dealt out constantly. There isn't many car scenes where all the cars come out clean. This is where ""Tokyo Drift"" excels - dirty and uncompromising racing. Whenever there is the chance cars clash, either to spin out the opponent, or knock them into a wall or even off a cliff.I recommend that people take a couple hours out of their day to sit back, relax and enjoy ""Tokyo Drift""",this_is_gibbo,"Jun 22, 2006"
8,Breath-taking movie...,"This is my first review of a movie, so hopefully it won't be too bad...First of all I'd like to address the positives of the movie. Anyone who loves cars will definitely love this movie, but that doesn't stop the non-car fanatics enjoy the movie as well. Myself being the latter, thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The cars were spectacular and I was in awe at how they all looked, especially Twinkie's Hulkmobile! The stunt-people did an amazing job and the same with the production crew. All the aesthetics were amazing and left me with what I can only describe as a feeling of awe. The storyline was the only thing that disappointed me, but it didn't detract from the overall feeling of the movie too much, the story wasn't what this movie was about, it was about fast cars, plain and simple. I think that if there was more of a story it would have started to draw attention away from the cars, which I reinforce, was the main appeal of the movie. All of the actors and actresses also did a fine job, when times got tough you could feel it, when times got awkward you could feel it, when times got sad... you could feel it. Everything else about the movie was spectacular, and is definitely one that I will watch over and over again in weeks to come.",rossfrazer,"May 15, 2010"
