7,Nostalgia train,Is it cheesy ? Definitely. Is it corny ? Oh ya. Did anyone deserve an Oscar? What do you think.Is it a cultural icon that has had a decades long lasting impact on pop culture worth your time ? ABSOLUTELY.Back in 2001 this movie was the next big thing. Everyone wanted a graphic'd out rice burner to drive around town in pretending they street raced.Everyone wanted a Mia or Letty. Everyone wanted to have Dom's muscles and Brian's hair.There's not enough to say about how this movie changed everyone in 2001. Just watch it yourself and put yourself in the mindset of 2001.,bhester0806,"Feb 28, 2021"
8,There's something about Vin,"Every summer a film comes around that takes everyone by surprise.  Last year it was Scary Movie and I'm sure in 1977 it was a film like Star Wars and then in 1981 it was Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Now I am not saying that The Fast and the Furious is in the same class as Raiders and Star Wars, just that it surprised everyone on the same level.  F&F is short on plot and dialogue and even some of the acting is lame, but what it is oozes is testosterone.  It pumps your blood, increases your adrenaline and attacks you with fast cars, sexy women and that one invariable that I think it has going for it... Vin Diesel.  There is just something about the guy, something that you really can't put your finger on, but he just has it. Maybe it is charisma, maybe it is charm, maybe it is just that he resembles some of the action heroes from the 80's with his chiseled triceps and his slabs of pecs.  Maybe it is all those things and maybe it is none of those things, all I know is that F&F is exactly what I had hoped it would be and nothing more.  This is the summer movie that I have been waiting for.  It's not that the films that have been out so far aren't that great because some of them are, it's just that this is the one that epitomises what summer as a teen ager is all about.  It is no wonder that exit polls for this film were around 65-70% under the age of 21.  And maybe that is why I enjoyed it so much.  I am pushing 30 but isn't it cool to lose yourself in a film that reminds you what it was like to be in highschool.  And isn't it cool to watch street racers break 140 miles an hour wile they shoot NOS through their vehicles?  Well isn't it?F&F doesn't contain any machinations similar to a film like Mission Impossible and it doesn't dazzle us with special effects of impending doom like Armageddon did, but it takes us into a world where people live life ""a quarter of a mile at a time.""  Vin Diesel plays Dominic Toretto, a massive, bald mechanic that owns a garage but street races on the side to make some extra cash.  Paul Walker ( The Skulls, Varsity Blues) plays Brian Spindler.  He is a cop that has infiltrated the street gang to find out who is highjacking trucks and stealing all their merchandise.  There are about four rival street gangs in L.A. and one of them is pulling this off.  He has to figure out which one. Of course along the way he seduced by the life, but that is not what we really care about.  All we want to see is lots of racing, a few crashes, some fights and some sex.  F&F doesn't disappoint.  If what you have seen in the trailers of the film excites and entices you, then you know exactly what you're in for.  This is not going to win any Oscars for anything but what it will do is entertain you.  It will expedite you for 90 minutes into a world where Honda's are souped up to look like Dragons and junkyard scraps are rebuilt from scratch to be better than they were before, better, stronger and faster.  If this film appealed to you in the commercial, it will appeal to you on the screen.And of course there is Vin Diesel.  He first made a name for himself in Saving Private Ryan where he played Capparrzo.  Then he jumped onto the scene with his excellent and grandiose turn as Riddick in Pitch Black.  I think this is the film that got him noticed because no one had even heard of him before this.  Then he did Boiler Room and he showed a different side to him.  But F&F is all muscle and sheer bravado.  I think Vin is going to do great things in the years to come.  He is not a nobody anymore.  This film will take care of that.  And face it, isn't it cool to see the genesis of a new action hero?  8 out of 10-  The ultimate summer rush!",baumer,"Jun 25, 2001"
8,The beginning of it all,"This is the movie that created a brand new mega movie franchise. Generally when there's movie franchises they make movies in the form of trilogies. But later this year when Fast and the Furious 6 comes out it'll be the sixth movie in the series which shows the level of box office appeal the series has to be able to pump out an average of 1 movie every two years is quite impressive. The only other series doing that kind of productivity with different directors on basically a once every 2 year rate is the James Bond series.Vin Diesel who outside of his other series Riddick movies generally puts out mediocre to bad performances was basically made to play the role of Dominic Torretto. Same goes for Paul Walker, normally when I see he's going to be in a movie I don't bother watching it. But somehow when these 2 guys get together in a movie about driving fast cars with hot girls it turns into a guilty pleasure.",Maniac-9,"Jan 18, 2013"
7,Surprisingly good,"Officer Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) goes undercover in the Los Angeles street racing circuits in order to find out which of the racing crews is committing crimes with their muscle cars. But going undercover is never easy, especially with such affable miscreants.The basic premise is really nothing special. But then again, it doesn't need to be. The point of this movie is in its style. It has fast cars, lots of racing, lots of hot, greased-up babes, muscle-heavy men (and cars) and a killer soundtrack. You don't watch it to be intrigued by carefully orchestrated plot points or tragic backstories or the heaviness of its pathos. No, you watch it to kick back, relax and have a good time.And in delivering that, the movie more than delivers. But if it was just that, I'd probably rate the film a bit lower. What actually elevates this film above its immediate peers and helped launch a huge franchise, is the fact that this film is punching above its weight class and succeeding. And it does that by having some real good actors playing roles they were born to play. Walker is one of them, but I also have to mention Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez.The dialogue is also surprisingly snappy and memorable. The plot, while basic, succeeds in making you care for these characters, and it also manages to make itself feel novel, despite arguably being at least a little clichéd. Once again, the fact that you care for these characters matters a lot.Not a groundbreaking movie by any means, but it has surprising quality underneath all the testosterone being forcibly pumped into your veins.",Vartiainen,"May 4, 2020"

10,A solid entertainment weel done action heist movie,"The Fast and the Furious (2001) It is solid decent action film of the film franchise. I love this film it is my third favorite film in the series. I wasn't watching this film for the cars or street races this film is about robbery, as a string of high-speed electronics truck robberies rocks the area. The Team stole $1.2 million worth of major electronics and the cops doesn't have any leads who has done it. There is only one team that could be responsible, Dominic Torreto (Vin Diesel) and his gang of street racers. During the night Torreto and his crew of street racers are driving cars in Los Angeles. Brian O'Conner (Paul walker) a undercover LAPD officer under the alias ""Brian Earl Spilner"", is he assigned to find out who is stealing the merchandise. This is my favorite film, it is an decent Action film about heist $1.2 million and not about the cars. Why I love this film? Because It is clever, intelligent, Entertained, fast paced and not boring film. The girls are beautiful in this team. The Action sequences are real and perfectly done. I love that late Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner and undercover L.A. Police Officer who try's to do the right thing. I am Paul Walker fan and Brian O'Conner is my favorite character of the whole franchise and series. I am saying The Fast and the Furious is better than 2,3 and even 7 so the film is pretty good.Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster did a terrific job playing their characters.With these players set in motion, it's up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. (One often sees great performances in mediocre films..here the story transcends the performances -- an impressive feat.) The script delivers. These themes are reinforced by the fine performances by Paul Walker and, particularly, Vin Diesel. Diesel's Toretto is a tough, no-nonsense, street-smart and highly-skilled racer on the outside, but as O'Conner and the audience come to know him, it is revealed that he is a human being with feelings, a troubled and hard past, and doing his best to get along, even if it means skirting or breaking the law. He's the head of a household, and the patriarch of sorts of a gang that is more family than it is a collection of members. Diesel brings hard-nosed and gritty energy to the role, but compliments that with a softer, more accessible side that makes him an odd sort of antihero, a man clearly in the wrong but not maliciously or spitefully so. Walker, too, is excellent as the undercover officer that finds the world of underground racing not-so-seedy as it seems. On the turbo-charged streets of Los Angeles, every night is a championship race. With intense full-throttle action, awesome high-speed stunts, and full-on pedal to the metal intensity, this fast and furious assault puts you in the driver's seat and dares you to exceed all limits.Los Angeles police officer Brian O'Connor must decide where his loyalties really lie when he becomes enamored with the street racing world he has been sent undercover to destroy.It don't matter if you win by an inch or a mile. Winning's winning. The Fast and the Furious is a gritty and gratifying cheap thrill, Rob Cohen's high-octane hot-car is a true rarity these days, a really good exploitation, the sort of thing that would rule at drive-ins if they still existed. The Fast and the Furious is a good Action movie. It offers a conventional plot but populates the story with well-developed primary characters that draw the audience in and make them care about their stories. In the movie, the line between good and bad becomes blurred to the point that, by the end, it matters not which side of the law the characters call home.I love this film to death! It is my 3d favorite film in the series franchise. The Fast and the Furious kicks ass! Even for PG-13 film they kick ass! Brian O'Conner kicks ass!!!",ivo-cobra8,"Oct 17, 2015"

No rating,It truly is Fast and Furious,"What makes this film so great? One of the many questions you find asking yourself as soon as you pick up the DVD or Video of this film. Well firstly before you dare to watch this film you must be one of these three types of people to be able to sit and watch this film (in my opinion) 1)A person who knows fast cars, 2)A person who likes to see these cars, and 3)A person who knows why you race them.If you aren't one of these people and just want to watch Vin and Paul in action then I'm afraid to tell you that you won't do this film any justice (although they are great in this film). I believe that the character that Vin plays was made for him and so was Pauls' character. Vin already has the style, the mood of Dominic Tretto (we have seen this in XXX) i personally couldn't have picked a better actor for the job for no one could pull it off like what Vin does. As for Paul i think it's great that they have used a so-called ""tall, lean, blonde pretty-boy"" for the part of Brian O'Conner because it brings out the fact that he is an under-cover cop. He's new in the field, it's his first mission and therefore he needs to look it too. We see his character evolve in the second film, which is also truly brilliant. So from me i think that the film should be at least rated at a 7 or 8 out of 10 even though the story does seem to drag on for awhile it is still a pretty good film and i hope you will agree. So from me watch this film and enjoy it too.",celtic_girl1990,"Sep 9, 2006"
7,"An action movie with a some-what plot, hot babes, fast cars, great action and a meet-expectations.","The Fast and the Furious is probably the first movie to get me into cars while at the same time enjoying myself without having to worry about a plot.Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner, a hot shot police officer, who goes undercover as a car junkie Brian Spilner to see if a local street racer/mechanic by the name of Dominic Toretto (Vin Diseal) has anything to do with hijacking a bunch of cargo from DVD's, TV's, entertainment sets, and so forth while at the same time falling head over heels for Dominic's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster). Brian comes so close while at the same time gaining trust to the target (Dominic) itself where it's only a matter of time before the truth comes out.The film itself has the best action sequences involving street racing and high octane action where despite a so-so plot to follow, or one that's been seen before (such as Point Break), you don't have to worry about a thing. It's just pure fun.The film also stars Michelle Rodriguez (S.W.A.T.) as Dominic's girlfriend, Letty; Ted Levine (The Silence of the Lambs) as Sgt. Tanner, and singer Ja Rule in a small cameo as a contestant against Dominic.",departed07,"May 1, 2008"

8,Solid movie... Worth renting,"Today I saw Tokyo drift and yesterday I saw 2 fast 2 furious for the fifth time, but I still find myself drawn toward the original. It stars Paul Walker as an undercover cop who infiltrates the street racing underworld of LA to catch a crook who has been hijacking millions of dollars worth of electronics from 18wheelers, causing the truckers to take matters into their own hands, ultimately ending in deaths and multitudes of money stolen. Now, you would think that because of the semi weak plot, this movie wouldn't be that good, however, the main storyline is just a small part of this movie, the other elements being action and some interesting relationships regarding vin diesels character. Diesel plays a street racing god, one of the best in the LA scene. Walkers character, Brians, way into the world is through Dominic Toretto (Diesel). Toretto has an air about him which draws other in, and Brian is no different. Throughout the movie, Brian is getting to know Dom, earning his trust, etc, but at the end of the movie, both Dom and Brian are forced to make a decision about each other... The whole relationship is interesting to watch. As for the action, there is plenty of it. Besides the many races, there is also some gunplay and some hand to hand fighting, and some interesting hijacking sequences.All in all the cars are hot, the girls are hotter, the cars are fast, the guns are loaded, and for the more serious, the relationship between Dom, Mia, Vince, Letty, and the others is amazing.If you haven't seen this movie, rent it tonight",skternate,"Jun 21, 2006"
7,Cars look cool and Babes look hot,"Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) leads a group of friends and family to street race in the LA night. Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) is a cop working undercover to infiltrate his gang of suspected truck robberies. However he finds himself falling under Dominic's charisma and for Dominic's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster).There is a lot of silly action, and unrealistic story lines. This is purely style winning over substance. The cars look cool and babes look hot. But it's the Vin Diesel presence and Paul Walker pretty boy looks that provide the heart of this movie. The boys have amazing chemistry and the gang feels like a real family. The story is almost unnecessary.",SnoopyStyle,"Nov 2, 2013"
1,Cunning Cops,"Could there be a movie made in this world worse than this one? Of course there is but this is still a shocking movie. What chance does a remake of ""Point Break"" seriously have? Neither contained a script worth performing, let alone an idea with originality. They both produced ordinary performances from the cast of alleged actors. They also both contained action scenes that were so ridiculous you could only smile at the the disgraceful way money is handed out to pretenders, sorry producers to make this crap.At least ""Point Break"" mixed the action scenes between sky diving and surfing rather than the mundane street racing over an over. Maybe they could have towed someone on roller skates behind the cars for extra adrenaline.",daveisit,"May 23, 2005"
No rating,"Hot Cars, Hot Girls, Hot Action, What more could you want?","I don't remember when the first time was that I saw The Fast and the Furious but it dosen't matter because it gets better with each viewing. This movie is filled with what guys want to see; Hot and fast tricked out cars, beautiful women, and kick ass action sequences. The world that the characters live in in this film is the world we can only dream of, to race in cool tricked out cars with dozens of beautiful women surrounding you and cheering you on. All of this is what I love most about this film but I also love the cast; Vin Diesal, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster all clinch their roles. If I were to pick my favorite cast member I would have to go with Michelle Rodriguez because not only is she a talented actress she is beautiful and bad ass in everything she's ever been in and this is probably my favorite role of hers. This is a movie were you really don't have to care about the plot because all the eye-candy and fun of this movie is the cars, girls, and action which is enough to pull you into the driver's seat. The cars are fast the action is furious and that's why this movie rocks.",daniel_velker,"May 22, 2013"
7,"Still ""Fast"" after all these years","Rob Cohen's ""The Fast and the Furious"" has no business being as great as it is. A film about fast cars, undercover cops, and highway robbery should provide limited, perhaps dimwitted thrills, but Cohen's colorful and swift-paced action outing provides such likable characters, slick stunts, and buoyant spirit that the whole affair elevates itself to the highest levels of lively, well-assembled fun. It is a surprisingly robust and satisfying experience.The film follows an undercover police officer working to infiltrate the world of street racing to bust a low-level crime syndicate. While undercover, he develops an affinity toward the racers and inconvenient brotherhood is established. Between the cars, busts, and friendships, a token crime story becomes a tale of family. It is simply compelling and effortlessly entertaining.Cohen creates a multi-ethnic world of sunshine, turbo charged technology, and well-rendered characters. It is a Los Angeles of beautiful paint jobs, palm trees, and lived-in locations. Color, verve, and speed burst forth from Cohen's frames in layered and lively compositions. Editing, design, and music create an always- pulsing energy that permeates every sequence.Though the film is about racing and the thrills that drive the sport, Cohen cast actors that earn as much attention as the horse- powered rockets. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Chad Lindberg, and Michelle Rodriguez form the family unit the inspires the film's themes and emotions. Each actor builds a solid character, with the leads being especially memorable. Diesel glowers and Walker exudes a naive charm. They form a charismatic duo.A slick and undeniably entertaining action gem, ""The Fast and the Furious"" soars with its combination of character and thrills. Set pieces are exciting, character beats are affecting, and the stunts are electrifying. It is a remarkable, sweat, oil, and sun-soaked piece of work.",ryanskywalker-87402,"Apr 12, 2017"
6,First drive-in movie of the millenium,"Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) wants to join the family of the head of California street racing (Vin Diesel)...but why?The plot is comic book level; the dialogue is very VERY bad...but who really cares?  This is a throwback of those dumb 1970s drive-in movies...it's for people who like loud, fast films filled with mindless action, attractive women, cars...and nothing else.  I didn't like the film.  It was too loud, too silly and way too long for a dumb action flick.  What saves it is some truly incredible action sequences (the ""hijacking"" sequence towards the end was unbelievable), some very nice, innovative direction, a cast that manages to be good despite the script and a very good performance by Vin Diesel. This was supposed to be Walker's breakthrough film but Diesel steals it away.  Also it looks kind of silly to have tall, lean, pretty boy Walker against tall, muscular, severe-looking Diesel.See it for the action and Diesel.  During the slow spots admire the cars or the women.",preppy-3,"Apr 28, 2003"
9,Damn I miss Paul Walker!,"The most traumatizing installment but very enjoyable none the less! I love so much of the film, the colors, cars, dialogue, and the fun vibes.

6,Smallest and most personal instalment in the series,"This film is a humble introduction to the world of The Fast and The Furious, a far cry from what the series would become. It starts off with some lovable characters and some street races. The scale of this film is smaller than most of the sequels but it has more heart.",briancham1994,"Jun 1, 2020"
9,It's more than just an action movie.,"This is a great movie. Far from being superficial pulp, this movie has a complex plot. Vin Diesel's performance is tremendous; his screen presence is dominating. He succeeds in carrying the movie. Although the movie contains lots of glitz, it also tells a story that deals with themes such as loyalty and betrayal. The rest of the cast is excellent too, especially Jordana Brewster and Paul Walker. Michelle Rodriguez is as usual wonderful. It would be easy to dismiss this movie as being little more than a live action cartoon, but the movie really is full of surprises. It has several intensely dramatic scenes, some of the most incredible car chase scenes, and some deeply esoteric verbal exchanges fraught with emotion. Whether it's Vin Diesel pouting or Paul Walker being heroic, the results are same: nonstop action, intense dialog, and interesting characters, all of which together produce great entertainment. It's more than just about automobiles.",PWNYCNY,"Oct 24, 2011"
7,Great car film,"I went into ""The Fast and the Furious"" knowing the acting and the plot wasn't going to be oscar worthy. I went into this film just for the pure action of fast cars. I was totally happy with the results of this film. This film had some of the best car chase/racing sequences I've ever seen. I loved the chase scenes in ""Bullit"",""French Connection"" and my favorite of all time, ""Ronin"". ""Fast and the Furious"" matches up pretty well with those great car sequences. If you like cars at all, you should think about seeing ""The Fast and the Furious"". It's just a fun summer film. Peace",gr3mta3,"Jun 24, 2001"

9,Great modern classic!,"There aren't many movies over the last dozen years to have a bigger impact on society than this one. The Fast and the Furious glorified street racing and made the Honda Civic and the other cars featured in the film must buys for teenage boys across America. The reason is pretty obvious, the movie is outstanding. The cast of Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, and others is outstanding and the story is really interesting and unique. The plot and characters are all really well developed, creating an immersive viewing experience not often seen in movies under two hours. The cars and race scenes are fantastic and the action has you sitting on the edge of your seat. The only negative for me was some of the cinematic effects. The director tried to get cute and a lot of those effects actually hurt the scenes, not helped. Nonetheless, those few sequences aren't enough to ruin the film and the entertainment value for the movie is still sky high.",Bruce722,"Jun 1, 2013"

5,Kid stuff for gearheads,"""The Fast and Furious"", adapted from a magazine article, could have been adapted from a comic book. With a simple minded plot,  some pretty awful acting by just about everyone (Diesel excepted), and the usual Hollywood excesses pushing the PG-13 envelope, ""The Fast..."" gets off on high octane street racing. From cool cars to hot babes this flick is made with one goal in mind: to separate the teen male from the price of admission. Not for mature audiences.",=G=,"Jan 16, 2002"

So many meme lines and amazing car action are packed into this pre-9/11, Y2K time capsule.

9,A joy ride of entertainment.,"The fast and furious will not exactly WOW you. But it will do enough to keep you entertained through out, thanks to it's excellent cast and furious race scenes. The film was a good idea and it could have not been executed any better then it was. The not so familiar director Rob Cohen did a very good job. Most scenes were well panned out and ribbon tied with it's cool racing or just brilliant acting. For that it really does deserve 9 stars.The major impact this movie had was it's pride. The fast and the furious did not get too a head of them selves and also didn't have the biggest budget to work with. But the movie reflects on a job well done. The movie is just simple plain fun, it take you for a enjoyable ride. The racing scenes were well though out, intense and very fun to watch. Some scenes were all the friends are together were witty and fun to watch too. The script was nothing major but decent. The acting was the brilliant, Vin Diesel knew and played his role very well, his role had the major impact. The plot was interesting but nothing real special.

I can respect shallow entertainment sometimes.  THIS MOVIE IS AWFUL. I'm not going to go into detail about the horrible acting; predictable, unoriginal plot; and the complete absence of any kind of meaning.  This is a dumb action movie that is just supposed to appeal to a person's shallow senses. The running time of this movie is 106 min.  Maybe 15 min of this movie actually has car chase scenes or action happening on the screen.  A mindless action movie should be at least 1/3 action.  Most of this movie is filled with unlikeable characters in their 20's, who act like they're in junior high, just conversing with each other like morons.  The only character in this movie I liked was the truck driver towards the end of the movie trying to kill all the main characters with a shotgun.

7,"Kinetic, ""hip"" street-racing flick with Vin Diesel and Paul Walker","A newbie to Los Angeles (Paul Walker) falls for a café host (Jordana Brewster) while trying to join a street-racing gang led by her brother, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel). Meanwhile the LAPD are trying to apprehend a radical group on the highways that targets semis and their valuable cargo. Michelle Rodriguez is on hand as Dom's babe while Matt Schulze plays an angry member of his gang.""The Fast and the Furious"" (2001) was the beginning of the popular street-racing franchise that currently has eight movies with two more planned. The over-the-top action is akin to ""The Road Warrior"" (1981) while the tone mixes the comic book melodrama of ""The Warriors"" (1979) and ""Torque"" (2004) with the more serious air of ""Grand Canyon"" (1991) and ""Training Day"" (2001). (Yes, I realize ""Torque"" and ""Training Day"" debuted after this one; I'm just providing comparative references).Speaking of the tone, there's no goofiness and the actors take everything dead seriously, which is good in my book, but the flick has several unintentional laughs because, while quasi-realistic, the thrills & posing are so exaggerated.Brewster and Rodriguez are effective in the feminine department, but neither do much for me personally. There are a few good-looking ladies in the periphery, however.The soundtrack contains several dynamic urban numbers, including the excellent ""Deep Enough"" by Live.The movie runs 1 hour, 46 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles & nearby areas (San Bernardino, Hemet, Malibu, Westminster, Beverly Hills, etc.).GRADE: B",Wuchakk,"May 8, 2019"
7,The start of a franchise that revolve around cars and a big break for two actors,"This movie was a big hit when it first came out in theaters, especially with it's budget. It's actually pretty obvious why this movie was so popular, mainly because of the suped up cars with girls and some aggressive racing and bits of action. In another words this is a popcorn flick for most guys and despite the plot not being that good, it still has elements which keeps the movie from being boring or dull. It's one of those movies where it's better to shut off your brain and just accept that entertaining and yet stupid stuff happening on screen in order to have a good time with it. This is also the movie where Vin Diesel and Paul Walker got their big break, and so this movie is the biggest thing that has probably ever happened to them especially when it comes to being in the movie industry. So yeah basically to sum it up, this is a film with a passable plot but has some thrill rides to go with it. Overall the execution was well done, it's a stupid/cheesy flick and yet it's cool and entertaining. Like one of Vin's line in this movie ""You break her heart, I'll break your neck"" it's lame but stands out although most of this movie is pretty cheesy for the most part.7.4/10",KineticSeoul,"Apr 28, 2011"

7,THIS is how you do summer movies,"If you want plot, script and oscar-winning performances, go rent Shawshank Redemption or something.Honestly, I don't know why some people have come down so hard on this movie. It's like saying, ""Airplane"" was dumb because the characters were poorly developed and shallow, and the plot was unrealistic.""The Fast and the Furious"" is a great summer, action flick.  Definitely gets the heart pumping and the adrenaline flowing.  The chase and race scenes have some great stunts.  The cars are gorgeous and fun to watch.  I saw it over a week after it opened, and the audience was still very receptive to the action in this movie.Now this is where I am supposed to slam the plot and the acting.  Well, to be honest, I thought the plot was quite GOOD, given that all they had to work with was the theme of ""street racing.""  I didn't think the acting was all that bad.  The entire cast did fine, given the script they had and the kind of movie it was.  One fatal mistake many action movies try to do is weave in too much drama or emotion, which inevitably ends up looking cheesey and just slows down the movie.  FnF was guilty of this, but only to a small degree.  A brief dive into Vin Diesel's scarred childhood, a little bit of corny romance for Walker, but that's it.  I respect a movie that knows what it is and doesn't try to cross any lines.The movie makers set out to make a movie that presents Import Racing to the masses.  So they had to make a plot to house that movie.  Personally, I think they did a pretty good job.  Definitely worth a go in a theater.PS: I never saw all of Point Break, but from what I did see, it looked dumb. Like an extended Mellow Yellow commercial.",Gambitt,"Jul 2, 2001"
10,Insanely Fast,"This movie, has by far the best car racing scenes ever filmed, as well as the best cars. They are gorgeous machines, and these guys certainly can drive them. Great story, not just another Gone in Sixty Seconds where all they did was steal cars, there actually weren't very many race scenes as you might expect, but every shot is filled with cars, and lots of them. The acting is great as well, as usual Vin Diesel gives a brilliant performance, as Dominic Toretto. It has already earned a massive following, and when you leave the theaters you will be filed with such a massive adrenaline rush, that you and all your buddies will be left with the feeling that you must go out and race. Everybody I have talked to have said the same thing, it just has this crazy adrenaline rush it gives you. I highly recommend this to all fans of cars, and racing, but it has something for everybody so see it even if you are not a fan of either, bottom line, just see it!!!!!!",jaded_aero,"Jun 25, 2001"

7,the first ride,"It's strange that one of the best franchises in movie history started off with Vin Diesel stealing a bunch of VHS players. Make no mistake about it, under the corny dialogue, awful soundtrack, horrid direction, and a general sheen that makes it clear that this is a 2001-ass movie from 2001, this is also at its core a Fast & Furious movie. So in preparation for the impending release of Furious 7, let's look how the film that started it all held to the franchise's tenants of Life, Cars, and Family.Life: Although the ""I live my life a quarter mile at a time"" mantra is corny, I think it plays well in the streets of the film's world. A world where respect is everything, but that respect has to be both earned and backed-up with actions. It means taking big risks, knowing your priorities, but also living in freedom of choosing your own destiny. While Dom's arc here is learning to live with that freedom, by his own code of honour, and the consequences and all it entails, Brian's arc is about earning that respect and choosing how far he's willing to go to get it. It may not seem a lot, but I think it speaks a lot to their arcs throughout the entire series, especially when you see how awkward Brian is at the beginning, knowing he'll eventually become one of the coolest and most respected white dudes on the planet later.Cars: Although originally envisioned as a movie about street racing, the film actually grinds to a halt when people stop to race. Director Rob Cohen is as bad at directing as he is at acting (As that Pizza Hut guy annoyed by street racers) and manages to make the races both boring, but also hideous to look at. He adds several horrible effects to each racing scene to convey speed and excitement, both CGI and otherwise, but it never feels, or looks right, and they also never sound right. Seriously, when people aren't talking, Cohen turns the film into some god-awful ""nu-metal"" or ""rapcore"" music video. All he needed was to add some crunk, and he would have completed a devil's threesome of best-forgotten 00s music genres. What is good however is how Cohen handles the heist, which the series would eventually realise is much more interesting than racing, which they prove here. Cars drive under trucks, people jump from cars to trucks, and people jump from trucks to cars. It's nothing the series wouldn't do better later, but it's still edge-of-your seat classic action, complete with a last minute save by our hero, Brian. As for the cars themselves, the only truly memorable one is Dom's classic Charger, which plays heavily into his back story.Family: Again, this movie is strangely best when people are talking, and not racing. The film obviously establishes the code of honour and of respect, but it's also about family, which the series is ultimately about. I forgot that they go into Dom's back story here, and why family is so important to him as he establishes one in the absence of his father, while being welcoming to all who gravitate towards him. His code of family really drives the film, and his accepting of Brian builds both Brian's character of being a good man and saving Dom, but also Dom's appreciation of Brian not leaving him behind build's up Dom. Family doesn't leave each other behind, and they watch each other's back. The film tries to make us think Brian's desire to help Dom is Mia-based, but I think he just really wants to be apart of that family, and Ted Levine even says he has to make a choice about which family he wants to be apart of. He kind of chooses the police in this film, but his actions here come back where he finally makes his choice in Fast and Furious.Overall, if you can get past the horrible direction and how dated the film is now, there's actually a lot to like here from the above and beyond character work, to the heist gone wrong. I never cared for this film when it came out, but looking back it has the early shine of the elements I love of this series. It's flawed, but I still like it.

1,My Most Hated Film,"Normally I don't comment on films that I knew I wouldn't enjoy just by seeing the trailer. But I was reminded of this atrocity when I recently saw a news blurb about another installment of this franchise and remembered when I saw it for the first 5 times. I was serving in the Navy back in 2002 and our IT department ran a channel shown on the ship that shows movies. Apparently, someone thought it would be a good idea to show this film over and over.This movie manages to be offensive on so many different levels that it boggles the mind and violates it at the same time. The plot is unoriginal and base, the dialog is poorly written and poorly delivered, the editing is like an epileptic seizure, and yet somehow it is overglossed and shined up. Kinda like a polished turd.And as if the film wasn't just badly acted and written, it also manages to offend just about everyone with an IQ above a 10 year-old who views it. I'd say it's misogynistic, but there are no women in this movie. There are material possessions that resemble women, but when their function is to be placed on the hoods of cars for decoration, won in races, or used against other men for position, than basically you've turned once promising actresses into blow-up dolls with heartbeats. There's also plenty of racial stereotyping. Whites, Hispanics, and Asians frequently insult each other based on skin color, but hey, that's hip, yo! But I'd have to say this film is more insulting to me as a man. If you believe this movie, then all men are insecure, materialistic blowhards who are in constant competition and serve only to one-up each other. Whether who has the faster car, who can break the law more, or who can get closest to the ever elusive ""menage a trois."" And what's sad, is that I've seen so many trailers for films that seem to ape this MTV culture of immaturity, faux-machismo, and flash-zoom editing since that basically make this the culmination of all that is bad in films today.I try to see the good in all movies, and if I can't, then I just say ""it's not my thing, but if someone else likes it, good for them."" This is the ONLY film I cannot let off the hook. It is unforgivable and I loathe its very existence.",MACarter214,"Apr 4, 2008"
No rating,Its all about the cars...,"While the last comment was very nicely written, it is only one person's opinion. The Fast and the Furious is all about street racing and until you actually race you kinda don't get the whole picture. Its not about the plot (which was a good plot, nicely organized, and played out) its all about the cars. How many people go to a movie just to see if the plot is played out in a good way? Maybe you guys should try watching the movie for the cars, the excitement, and the people...not for a stupid plot. Don't knock it until you try it, street racing is a fast-paced topic to make a movie out of. I love this movie!",XxmakingcrazeexX,"Feb 19, 2003"

10,A perfect 10...,"I just saw it for the thousand time, and it's still as good as the first time I saw it. Rob Cohen is a pure genius, he truly is. These movies are magnificently awesome and I'm going to tell you why. No Spoiler alerts I promise.Let's start with the basics. The script and plot is close to perfection. Everything from Action, comedic feuds, deceit, romance and amazing surprises. It has a little of everything and a lot of the rest.The characters' difference is brilliant. The background of them is hidden beneath the surface of someone completely different. They're just amazingly entertaining. They're personalities is even better. I can't say anything else because I'm out of words; speechless.The action scenes are incredible for a movie like this. I won't say to much about them though, but if you haven't seen it yet, do so. The first scene when you see how good Brian drives is good and when you see the spark he has, and how his driving improves throughout the movie; nice, very nice. The turning point is pretty good too, but you'll have to find it yourself because I am not going to spoil your movie-experience. The twists in the movie are good, and there is more than one as well. Everyone has secrets, and the secrets are what make this movie just as good as it is. Without the secrets the movie wouldn't be worth watching. OK, let's talk about the acting. First, Mark Vincent (or as you may know; Vin Diesel), I'm a big fan for a reason. There's never anything to say on his acting, so I won't even get into how amazingly amazing he is. So, the rest of them, I am a little iffy on their names so I am just going to call them by their character names. Brian, or the guy who played his role in the movie did a great job and so did Mia and Vince. There wasn't any bad acting in the movie, only good acting and some awesome acting.The mix of secrecy, trust and romance is pretty damn good. I'm running out of adjectives. So I'll just try and wrap this up and give you my concluding opinion and rating of this movie.This movie is definitely worth watching. I really and truly recommend you to watch this movie and its following movies. They are worth watching, ask anyone who've seen them they'll tell you the same. Personally I think it's great and awesome and so does my pal here who watched it with me an hour or so ago. For my rating, based on everything I wrote and didn't write, I give it 10 out of 10 stars. Why? I couldn't find anything negative about it and since I still enjoy watching after all these times I've already seen it it's probably worthy of a perfect 10.Rating: 10/10Thanks for reading my review.

7,The start of Universal's biggest franchise to date.,"A slick, adrenaline-fuelled action flick featuring a hot cast, a cool soundtrack, and countless custom cars, The Fast and the Furious is designed primarily to appeal to the young petrol-head crowd—those who would spend a fortune on a sound system for their ride and then blast crap music out of the windows while sat in a McDonald's car park (at least here in the UK). Anyone heavily into car culture will probably wet themselves in excitement over the modified machines on display.But even if the idea of highly-polished Japanese street cars with more expensive accessories than a Kardashian doesn't get your pistons pumping, there's always the human eye-candy: for the ladies, there's blonde-haired, blue-eyed Paul Walker and bald bit of rough Vin Diesel, while the guys get numerous tasty young women to ogle, including Jordana Brewster as Vin Diesel's younger sister and Michelle Rodriguez as feisty girl-racer Letty. We also get lots of impressive stunts to keep the pulse pounding, with a great chase scene featuring one character dangling from a truck cab while being shot at by the driver, and a white-knuckle jump across railway tracks in front of an oncoming train that results in a spectacular crash.",BA_Harrison,"Jul 25, 2015"
10,Simply best movie ever,"Not only because it was shot at my hometown (Los Angeles CA) but, it has every essence of a great film. This to me is the best movie of all the FF franchise. This movie touches action, love, hate, friendship, adrenaline etc. It has a great storyline to keep you entertain. This movie I believe was very successful not only because during that point during the American culture Auto Tunning was reaching its peak but because of the actors selected. At that time these were not world wide icons and had not been involve in a blockbuster movie that would tattooed their careers in Hollywood. Finally I just want to point out that I am no movie critic or someone who studied in order to criticize a movie, I am simply an average Joe that likes to see all kinds of movies but, specially action movies been The Fast and the Furious my favorite movie of all times. Have to say that my first ever DVD (or movie for that matter) I bought with my own money was this FF movie.",eskyy10,"Jul 2, 2014"
7,For fans it is a great classic without a doubt!,"It has great actors, good performances for the time and well-designed racing scenes with meaningless action and a slightly dispersed script, to make the ""dramatic scenes"" more interesting.

1,A lemon,"I don't think this movie is worth much at all.  Too many stupid scenes, too much bad acting, too much to appeal to a 15 year old and no one else.  None of it was clever, interesting, realistic or worthwhile. 
The actors all have exactly one expression - anger - and they never stray far from that.  I think they all took the second half of the title too seriously.  Why are they furious anyway?  What do they have to be furious about? Paul Walker literally sleepwalks through the entire movie and if Vin Diesel is the new action hero for the new generation, I want a recount.  I liked Jordana Brewster a lot in ""The Faculty"" and was looking forward to seeing her in this, but she's wasted.  Michelle Rodriguez is cementing her future as a tough girl doing movies like this - wasn't she in that female boxing movie too?The only positive thing I can say is that the movie seems to have some respect for its audience.  By being rated PG-13, at least the people who would most benefit (!) from seeing this garbage would be allowed in.
Racing scenes are no great achievement, either. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Makes ""Driven"" seem like its not the most recent disaster on wheels - at least you could laugh at that one. 1/10.",Boyo-2,"Jul 30, 2002"
8,A fine example of cinematic adrenaline and incredulity,"The Fast and the Furious is, at the very least, an intriguing franchise, for it gives gearheads the kind of inspiration and fantasy they need to have to keep sane. I've always found car hobbyists to face quite the paradox; the problem with cars is that they are grossly expensive, so if you're a middle class man, having two is quite the luxury. However, if you're deep into cars as a fascination, you presumably not only want one or two cars, you want several, and you want them customized and rigged to your liking. Customizing and optimizing the performance on one car is grossly expensive, but having a garage of half a dozen or more customized/optimized vehicles could cost as much as your house and your neighbor's houses put together. This is why, each and every day, I'm more and more satisfied with my lack of interest in cars and my own obsession with the Honda Accord I drive.The Fast and the Furious also gives gearheads that kind of adrenaline rush and visualization of their dreams realized because they, themselves, often don't have the means, the vehicles, nor the kind of closed-range courses to carry out the kind of eye-popping stunts and mayhem the characters in these films cause. It caters to that level of unbridled excitement, when you're actually racing in a vehicle and that moment where you get that indescribable pang in your chest reminding you know that you're alive. I was fully ready to embrace this franchise for its fantastical elements, but unsure if I could still be entertained watching car chases and death-defying stunts for an upwards of two hours.What's pleasant about The Fast and the Furious is that it focuses on the relationships the characters have with one another in the midst of all the racing. The film's slender plot revolves around Brian O'Connors (Paul Walker), an undercover Los Angeles police officer sent to infiltrate a ring of truck hijackers and street racers in the heart of L.A.. Led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), a suave know-it-all when it comes to vehicles, the gang is known for their heavily armed carjacking activities of large eighteen wheelers, in addition to their work at auto-body shops where they modify and customize cars, some of which flirting with and others unabashedly breaking the laws of what is street legal. Also working in Dom's crew are Leticia Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez), his longtime girlfriend and mechanic at his shop, in addition to his sister Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster), whom becomes the apple of Brian's eye late in the film.Brian's infiltration of Dom's ring soon becomes corrupted by his fascination with the culture Dom and his crew have created; it's a culture that specializes in prompting and maintaining a longterm adrenaline rush in the most unique and heart-pounding ways. Despite Brian's responsibility to uphold the law through all this, he finds his involvement with Dom going above and beyond the call of the law, as far as hooking up with Dom's sister and helping Dom plot a crackdown of former partners that have turned into rival gangmembers following a reneged agreement.No matter which way you slice it, The Fast and the Furious is slight in substance, but often very strong on a level of entertainment. At only one-hundred minutes, it pleasantly skates by without being too much of an assault on the senses and operates largely on the charm and infectious personalities of its actors. Walker is the standout of the crowd, maintaining a certain level of cool and street-smarts and his character never hitting the level of cocksure confidence, making him a more watchable and likable presence. That's not to undermine Diesel's role here, because without him, this film wouldn't be as much of a bromance as it already is. From the first race, it is clear that Walker and Diesel have enough chemistry to create a bond between two opposite characters in terms of life paths in order to go on many more adventures with one another. The supporting cast of Rodriguez and Brewster are fine, though even in more masculine roles, the two feel like nothing more than decorative pieces of eye-candy that help further the plot along when convenient.But perhaps such was just destined to be the case in The Fast and the Furious, a film where escapist tendencies take over and nothing else matters besides the moment when your car begins to redline or a part becomes misplaced in Dom's garage of odds and ends. Being that this film largely predicates itself on male bonding and the thrill of racing from both an illegal and adrenaline-charged angle, The Fast and the Furious largely possesses a homey quality that makes it believable and grounded in reality, despite a certain conclusion with a certain train that, I confess, was still entertaining in the realm of cinematic incredulity. This is a fun and effective film in being every gearhead's fantasy and being a damn fine piece of entertainment.Starring: Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, and Jordana Brewster.

This movie is awesome in my opinion. And no, it did NOT make me want to go out and do 140+ MPH in my car after seeing the movie. There are good performances in this movie. This was the first time I'd seen Vin Diesel in a film, and I think this guy is going to be HUGE. Paul Walker isn't bad either, but Vin Diesel stole the show here. The cars were great too, plenty of nitrous-powered, fuel-injected insanity for gear heads (and wannabe gear heads) everywhere. The addition of that black Dodge Charger (!!) just made things that much sweeter. To tell you the truth, I had wanted to see this pretty much ever since it first came out but never had; it was a car-loving ex-girlfriend who finally convinced me to see it a couple years ago. I've since gotten the DVD myself, and intend to watch it again in the next few days.

7,The film that made a lot of actors popular,"Upon first reading the title, viewers would get the first impression that this film involves just racing cars. In a sense, it does but in a different way than your standard track race of 99 laps. It involves much more than that and to demonstrate this, a cast of actors were chosen for this franchise that have taken the genre of driving cars to the next level. This is the movie that brought several no name actors to the spotlight. The most obvious is Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. And what almost seemed like would be a strange mashup of racing and detective work, turned out to be a fairly solid film.Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner, an undercover cop who is trying to help the FBI capture a group of road bandits who end up plundering innocent truck drivers traveling down highways. To do this, he digs deep into the underworld of street racing where racers of different backgrounds and revved up cars come together for a common cause. The thrill of the ride and all the benefits that come with it; sex, drugs, respect and money. As he slowly assimilates with his surroundings, he befriends a man named Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family members. There he begins to investigate who is behind the truck jackings.This is actually not a bad plot at all. The writing does have its weak points, which will be touched upon but let's start with the positive. I enjoyed how O'Conner has to come to grips with himself and who he's going to support. This shows that he's a human being and has a conscious. The same goes for Dominic Toretto, in a different way though. Toretto must come to grips with himself knowing he wasn't the person he once was. Both characters are from very different worlds yet they share a struggle that resembles each other. That struggle is being human and knowing who you are as a person. Sure it's not believable in every aspect but at least it lets the audience know that these characters do have a mind of their own.The weak part to the film is the final scene. All there is to say is that it is too abrupt. It completely detours from what the plot was centered on, along with leaving a few subplots open for interpretation. But was it needed - no. It would be nice to see some closure on more than one subplot. Surely if this franchise didn't earn a sequel then where would the conclusion to this story be? Hard to say. But if there's one thing that helps make up for that are the racing sequences to this movie. Even if you're not a racing fan, the action scenes should entertain. I mean, who doesn't want to (or enjoys already) driving over the speed limit for fun? Driving at high speeds gets the adrenaline pumping and makes every action much more intense. So if you don't enjoy that kind of thing, this movie isn't for you.The editing by Peter Honess who also did The Shadow (1994), L.A. Confidential (1997) and Highlander (1986) did a good job here as well. The shots are well connected and will keep the attention of the audience quite easily. The score produced by BT isn't anything to praise over though. Some action scenes didn't even contain music, which was odd because you'd think one would want to make that scene more intense by adding music. And although he doesn't create a theme for the franchise, his music does match the tone and attitude of the film. And for this kind of film, as long as it maintains that, that's all that matters. Because there is also contemporary music inserted in various scenes, BT's music transitions well into the contemporary music. It's good.It lacks logic in a few areas and has a loose ending but the car scenes and actors help them overcome that. Plus it has some unexpected character development that helps give the main characters a good amount of charm.",breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,"Jan 13, 2014"
4,The rubber melts on the road. Live life a quarter of a mile at a time!,"Story does not totally lack substance, but primary purpose is to show of some fast and pretty souped up cars. Vin Diesel fans will rejoice. Otherwise don't expect much to redeem pit grease. An undercover cop(Paul Walker) infiltrates a gang of L.A. street racers in hopes of solving moonlight highway robberies. Also in the cast are Chad Lindberg, Rick Yune, Ja Rule and the ever so hot Michelle Rodriguez. Not the worst ever made, but an Indy 500 away from mediocre.

7,A good fast paced action film,"To go in and watch The Fast and Furious, it is a lesson in expectations as it is obviously not a masterpiece, and you should not expect it to be either. it does exactly what it says on the poster though and the film is fast and the action is furious.The story of Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) who is a undercover police officer. Trying to breaking on to the Street racing scene. Through Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) so he can bring down a crew who are hijacking trucks. The thing with the film is that in a lot of ways it is terrible. I'm not a Rob Cohen fan, of all his films this is probably the best of his work in my opinion and only challenged by 1996's Dragonheart. In acting terms Paul Walker is a good looking guy but lacks real acting talent and charisma on screen. Vin Diesel though does have good screen presence, and at times I think is an underrated actor. The supporting cast is generally OK except for the insufferable and thankfully only in it for a short period Ja Rule, and the definitely not very intimidating Reggie Lee as the main protagonists henchmen.What is surprising and actually good about the film is that it does have a nice simple plot and develops the characters as we get to know about Dom's father and his childhood, and see Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) and Brian fall in love. The Car chases are decent and again are practical effects, which are better than CGI Green screen chases uses in some of the sequels. Praise also has to made of the final sequences involving the final hijacking, the chasing of some drive by shooters and the final race off. which were very thrilling and kept you on the edge of your seat until the end.I can't say i love this film, because i don't. But i did like it and enjoyed the ride while it lasted.",paulsrobinson,"May 21, 2013"
1,fast and futile,"Don't waste your money on this one. If you would like to see street racing, go to the source. Its a cheap rip off of what street racing is really all about. This movie sucks!!!!

I went to the theaters 13 times to watch it and then I bought the movie the first day it was out on video. I even have it on DVD. I thought Paul Walker was excellent in this movie.

Not to mention the cars were so awesome.",caleed07,"Apr 14, 2002"
7,Better than average summer action flick,"Reading some of the reviews posted on the site, it seems some people were expecting too much from this movie. I went to see this expecting good race and action scenes and not much else, and it delivered. I didn't go in expecting Academy Award material, and anyone who saw the previews should've done the same. I thought some of the acting left something to be desired, but it was adequate for the movie. The action sequences were definitely the highlight of the movie, especially the street racing scenes. I didn't mind the plot holes or the paint-by-numbers romance side plot, I wanted action and I got it. I liked it so much I saw it again a few days later. Lighten up and take this movie for what it is.",NateW,"Aug 20, 2001"
7,Much better than Expected,"I must admit that before I saw this film I was expecting it to be beyond horrible.  However, I opened my mind to it because I absolutely love Michelle Rodriguez.  Not surprisingly she was excellent in this film. And I must credit the film makers with taking a movie plot which I thought sounded, let me be blunt--stupid and turning it into a movie that was at least able to entertain me.  This was a nice surprise.  Turned out to be an OK flick that I may even watch a 2nd time some day.",MizPinkno1082,"Apr 19, 2002"
8,First and the best,"I know that this franchise is over the top by now, but first in the series was still by my opinion the best.Story follows undercover cop who tries to infiltrate in underground street race team
but becomes friend with leader of the gang and falls in love with his sister.Story is old cliche but it has that old school feeling of good action movie with macho main characters, beautiful women and great race cars. Now with 9 sequel in motion this first one is still about street race and not Jame Bond style movie.And the big bonus is great soundtrack with music that forces you too hit a gas pedal.",sikeone55-1,"May 1, 2021"

BUT - Did nobody realized, that the same story (the exact same story!) is to be found in ""Point Break"" with Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze??

9,It will leave you dazed and breathless.,"It begins with a spectacular action scene where three Honda Civics execute a high-speed highjacking of a cargo truck, and from there, the action never stops. With The Fast and the Furious, director Rob Cohen seeks to capture and thrill the audience with a booming soundtrack and non-stop action, and he seems to have succeeded.The film follows officer Brian O'Connor as he infiltrates a street-racing gang in order to capture the drivers of the three enigmatic Hondas, which have been terrorizing truck drivers in Los Angeles. The gang is led by ex-racer Dominic Toretto. Toretto immediately takes a liking to O'Connor, while his gang seems a bit skeptic. Toretto's right-hand man Vince is O'Connor's main problem, as he suspects the truth about his identity from the very beginning.The plot is slightly dry, as the movie incorporates many typical aspects of other films of the genre. For example, there's the fact that Toretto is the only one to trust O'Connor. The rest of his gang except for, of course, Vince, quickly follows him. Then there's the whole falling-in-love-with-the-sister-of-the-guy-I'm-about-to-get-arrested subplot. And then there are your typical problems from rival gangs and the hero's attempt to prove himself by striking against them. Yet despite the many stereotypical aspects of the script, the well-developed characters and interesting relationships save the movie from becoming just another heap of typical Hollywood sensationalism.The movie features strong acting, as the actors work well together and compliment each other's performances. This is only Michelle Rodriguez' second major performance since her film debut in the independent drama Girl Fight, which was a hit at the Cannes Film Festival last year. Not just another bad girl, Rodriguez shows a strong acting ability, which is apparent in her portrayal of Lena. Vin Diesel is also a fairly good actor who seems to be climbing through the ranks of Hollywood. Best known for his role in the failed science-fiction thriller Pitch Black, Diesel sports a memorable attitude and strong screen presence that promise to make him a contender for future stardom. Opting to cast less known, yet strong actors instead of more commercially viable ones, Rob Cohen has created a well-rounded cast, which gives the movie its fresh attitude and memorable mood.Yet it is the action scenes that are the real stars of the movie. Featuring three races and four equally spectacular action sequences, the movie delivers fast and furious action from beginning to end. Accompanied by a rocking soundtrack, the action sequences are put together by flawless editing and elaborate stunts, effectively creating a maddening adrenaline rush in any viewer.A long time producer and Harvard graduate, Cohen has achieved success a director, with movies such as Dragonheart, The Skulls, Daylight, Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story (which he also wrote and starred in) and several episodes of the series Miami Vice. He is also a screenwriter and has had small roles in some of his movies. He plays a pizza delivery boy in The Fast and The Furious.Although the slight semblance of a plot does not make this something for the serious moviegoer, the relentless action more than makes up for it. Not too long and filled with fantastic cars and non-stop entertainment, The Fast and the Furious will leave you dazed and breathless.",first_person_shooter,"Jul 16, 2001"

5,The movie that started it all,"You've all seen them. Kids driving around in their ""souped up"" cars... tinted windows, flashy decals, low profile tires, sweet rims, body kit, wing, and of course the noisy turbo blow-off valve and a few NOS stickers. This movie is basically filled with street-racers doing quarter miles. Meanwhile, Dom and his goons are also stealing car parts. There's a bunch of sub-plots going on here. The movie wasn't all that bad. I watch it from time to time.The bad points: The quarter miles take 5 minutes to complete They manage to reach 160 mph in a quarter mile. Impossible - Not only that, they manage to use their NOS in the quarter miles There are quite a few continuity/editing errors that are easily picked up by anyone who knows something about cars Ja Rule shouldn't act... ever again! The trend that it started. All of a sudden, everyone knows about customizing cars.The good points: The cars are pretty sweet There is action It is fast paced Its watchable They pump oil into a guy's mouth Watch it.

10,Comes at you Fast AND Furious,"The Fast and the Furious comes at you like it says.  It's not a long movie and really never slows down much at all!  Those looking for a movie delving into a complex plot with in depth charachters need not watch it.  The movie is as the preview shows, a lot of great car chase scenes held together by a loose form of a plot.  It does what Gone in 60 Seconds only wishes it could do.  In gone in 60 you have 2 scenes with cars driving fast at all.  Here you have at least 6 or 7 distinctly different and memorable scenes. Although acting ability and some of the lines lack severely, this can be forgiven and is made up by the cars. This movie is perfect for anyone into speed and tuned import sports cars for the most part(yes, even the occasional despicable economy car made to ""perform"" is present)I saw the previews knowing this was going to be basically an adrenaline rush of a movie, and I gave it a 10 because that's what it delivered.",SupraTurbo,"Jun 25, 2001"
7,Good Mindless Action,"I thought the movie was worth seeing.  I liked the cars and action/racing sequences.  The acting wasn't great, but was tolerable.  The story was ok, but some characters seemed to be extraneous.  I don't know much about cars, but the ones they had were pretty cool.  Lot's of ""rice rockets"".",progard,"Jun 7, 2001"
1,Probably one of the worst films ever made.,"The Fast and the Furious is bad. Not only bad, but painfully bad.The film contains no plot, no people that can act, no directing, no good anything. Nice cars, though. Is that the only thing that counts to make a film today?I'm angry over the fact that they spent millions of dollars on this ""movie"", when there are so much better ways of spending the dollars, like betting them in Las Vegas, maybe. You'd probably get more in return too.
So who is responsible for this? Lets see... The director, Rob Cohen, has made such increadible films as The Skulls (yuck!) and Daylight (HAHAHAHA!). The writer, or should I say writers, made such crap as Hollow Man and Split Second (Gary Scott Thompson). The other writers can't boost with such ""successes"". :)Maybe I shouldn't ""review"" this boring and superembarrasing flick, because I turned it off after a while. I just couldn't stand it. Where's the fun in watching cars with lights under them, girls with ""almost no clothes"" and guys with stupid hair, if there is no action, no story and, well... nothing else at all?If you like to watch girls with bikini-looking clothes and colorful vehicles, this is for you. If you have some sort of brains though, and need something more to be entertained, then don't bother with this sorry excuse for a movie.I've seen wallpaper that is more entertaining than this.1 out of 10.",Pingo-2,"Jul 26, 2003"
No rating,Brilliant film!,"Hot cars...sexy actors?!? What more could anybody want? LOL I thought this film was brilliant the first time i saw it in the cinema, the bass in the backing songs and the revving of the engines made the cinema vibrate and this added to the atmosphere of the whole film.I loved the acting, the actors and actresses were chosen suitably for the part they played, for example you'd never know that Michelle Rodriguez (Letty) wasn't originally written into the script and they had to create a part for her, everything works so well. The friendships that were found and the TEAM efforts meant everyone was included (maybe with a little rivalry between Vince and Brian at the beginning) BUT it all worked out in the end showing that friendships over ride all.The cars were brilliant (me i love my cars!) but these were SEXY cars with popular names and each car suited it's actor / actress down to the ground. This film works well, the stunts are awesome and the acting is superb...i will watch my DVD time and time again :) I hope the SEQUEL is as good even tho Vin Diesel isn't cast into it :(",sandz_luvs_hugs,"Aug 25, 2002"
6,A buddy movie with a heart,"This was my first experience with the Fast and Furious series and I wasn't disappointed. A charming Hollywood version of Rebel Without a Cause mixed with a somewhat unconvincing heist film. But at heart it's an old fashioned buddy movie, with Vin Diesel and Paul Walker as handsome and charismatic leads. (It's no surprise that they would return for future episodes of the series, until Walker's tragic death in 2013.) Not much is made of their female counterparts, played by a sultry Michelle Rodriguez and the very beautiful Jordana Brewster. You might say that the real leads of this film are the cars, but although a lot is made of the technical side of things, the focus fortunately is on the people behind the wheel. The car chases and races that the series is known for are great though. It's one of those films where as a viewer you get the idea that the actors all got on in real life and that it was real fun to make. Unpretentious film making at its best and a great introduction to one of the most successful film series of all times.",edwinbodegraaf,"Jul 7, 2021"

7,It hit the spot.,"In contrast to Driven, The Fast and the Furious actually hit the mark it was aiming for.  In fact, I might go so far as to say that it actually surpassed my expectations.  I'm not going to go overboard here and suggest that it is a masterpiece of cinema.  However, it is certainly a cut above the average Hollywood movie.  Firstly, its theme is one of inherent interest.  There is something really quite engaging about the life of a street racer: modifying a run-of-the-mill Japanese compact car into a 500bhp vehicle that can do a quarter-mile in 10 seconds and gathering in the middle of the night with 100 like-minded racers to wager thousands of dollars on quarter-mile drag races.The film had great energy and was just angry enough to give it attitude, but not too angry as to be obnoxious.  The race and chase sequences were excellent; full of high speed action and cool camera angles.  Unfortunately, there were a couple of crashes that people walked away from which, in real life, would have seriously injured those involved.  But apart from the odd departure from real-life, the driving seemed actually pretty accurate.The story and characters were also better than I expected.  There were some tough choices for the hero, Brian (played by the blue-eyed Paul Walker), and you actually felt like you got to know the main players a bit.  Vin Diesel, who plays opposite Walker as the charismatic, if harsh, street racing legend Dominic, has an on-screen presence similar to Ving Rhames.  In fact, it is Diesel who forms the backbone of the film, both within the context of the story and with his performance.In addition to the great races and chases, there are some nice scenesinvolving interaction of the characters.  In particular, a moment towards the end, when Brian reveals his true identity to Dominic, generates a great deal of tension.As with many films of this nature, it would be easy to pick it apart. Dissecting the inconsistencies in the story and illogical decisions of the characters would, however, just be a futile engagement.  This film is more about the experience than the meaning... more about the journey than the destination.",sunface,"Jul 3, 2001"

They must've spent a few million quid on special effects, so why couldn't they spare a few more to have someone check out all the technical stuff in the script? All that b******s about Nitrous Oxide and cracking welds on inlets and burning out piston rings and having titanium valve springs (Hah! I'd love to see a spring made of titanium...) and all sorts of other cr*p.

Sure, the cars in this movie are not what an ordinary European lad would regard as decent, some of the parts are quite alluring (T66 with NOS you know... ;-)) but among the car bodies there are some that look way too stereotype (Honda Civics...?).The story is entertaining, though rarely sophisticated. This, I guess, is the reason for why someone reader of IMDb commented that in this movie Vin's talent was wasted.

2,An absolute farrago that frankly fails to entertain.,"I gave this film every chance, but at every turn I could not quite believe the extent of its failure as both entertainment and film-making. My mind was much as antagonized as were my ears by this film's far from unique blend of noise, nonsense and numbskullery.Rarely if ever have I been rendered so disinterested in a movie's opening in particular than with this film. No attempt is made to draw the viewer in whatsoever, with shoddy direction of unrelated, uneventful scenes. The ""effect"" of the car scenes is but one-trick-schtick. The music is unimaginatively chosen, and in its blaring merely adds to the unsubtle, dulling overall effect of such scenes. There really is nothing original or particularly impressive about the director's use of visuals and sound.The acting is resolutely bad in a semi-laughable vein. If this ""Diesel"" chap is one of Hollywood's ""brightest up-and-coming stars"", he does little to show why here. His one-note performance consists merely of risible, cliched ""hard man"" posturing, inane shouting and a touch of the insufferably phony. This actor exudes none of the magnetism and genuine cool of, say, Robert Mitchum or Paul Newman, who could both act a bit as well... Diesel and Paul Walker, as the two leads, really do fail to induce any interest. The token ""emotional"" stuff is, as others have commented, utterly laughable. That one pathetic scene of this ilk has caused other reviewers to brand the film ""multi-layered"" and the like, is even more laughable. Trite lines delivered in a stilted, faux-sincere manner make for unintentional amusement and nothing besides. The main female actors are just as ineffectual; their characters are so thin they may as well have been reduced to the eye candy status of various other female ""extras"" on show throughout the film. That is not say, mind you, that genuine allure is generated at any stage... it's all rather perfunctory and sanitized.The plot? Well, indeed I don't *expect* such action movies to be well scripted and interesting, but it would make a change if one actually was. There is no serious attempt to provide a cohesive story line, attempt to twist the formulaic or be at all offbeat. The bones of this script are chronically malnourished and boundlessly bare. The way plot strands are introduced and just as soon discarded without reason, just illustrates this. The writers and director are either being condescending to their target audience, or, remarkably inept - if they consider this script of any merit at all. Also, the lack of humour renders the film toothless, with the drag racing culture dully and unconvincingly put across. It all just comes across as moronic, violent and slightly sordid. The film also fails to show the side of the law with any gravitas, realism or interest, besides the incredulity stirred within me at the sight of a police/FBI headquarters in the form of some mansion equipped with a swimming pool...! The very vagueness of Paul Walker's character and the subplot centering around Diesel's activities, is matched by the equally vague and unconvincing way the police are portrayed.This is a movie with no focus, fascination or indeed, ""fury"" if you will, beyond a facile, faltering nihilism. An assault on the senses it may well be, but it is a rather hollow and unprovoked assault.Rating:- */*****",HenryHextonEsq,"Sep 16, 2001"

6,A Thrilling Classic That Started It All,"""The Fast and the Furious"" speeds onto the screen as a thrilling and groundbreaking action film that kick-started one of the most beloved franchises in the industry. Released in 2001, this movie introduces us to the world of illegal street racing and the adrenaline-fueled lifestyle that accompanies it.The plot centers around undercover cop Brian O'Conner, played by Paul Walker, as he infiltrates a gang of street racers led by Dominic Toretto, portrayed by Vin Diesel. As Brian immerses himself in this high-octane world, he finds himself torn between loyalty to the law and the bonds he forms with his newfound ""family"" on the streets.What sets ""The Fast and the Furious"" apart is its raw energy and authenticity. The film captures the essence of the street racing subculture, immersing viewers in a world of modified cars, intense competitions, and the adrenaline rush of illegal racing. The attention to detail in the car sequences adds a layer of realism, making each race feel exhilarating and dangerous.The performances in this film are solid, with Paul Walker and Vin Diesel leading the way. Walker brings a sense of youthful enthusiasm and determination to his role, while Diesel embodies the brooding and magnetic presence of Dominic Toretto. Their on-screen chemistry drives the narrative forward, creating tension and camaraderie.""The Fast and the Furious"" delivers pulse-pounding action sequences that have become the signature of the franchise. The car races are expertly choreographed, blending practical effects and stunning visuals to create heart-stopping moments. The film's soundtrack also deserves recognition, as it perfectly complements the fast-paced action and adds to the overall atmosphere.While the plot may be straightforward, the film succeeds in capturing the spirit of rebellion and the thrill of the underground racing scene. It taps into universal themes of loyalty, family, and self-discovery, resonating with audiences beyond its target demographic.""The Fast and the Furious"" remains an important entry in the franchise, laying the groundwork for the high-octane adventures that would follow. Its impact on the action genre cannot be overstated, as it introduced audiences to a world of fast cars, intense races, and memorable characters. This film is a must-watch for fans of the series and anyone who appreciates adrenaline-fueled entertainment.",sufyaanrashid95,"Nov 19, 2023"
7,Street level 2000s,"It's been at least more than a decade since I watched this and this really feels like a standalone pulpy early 2000s movie that is cliched and entertaining. It was really street level and it's about stealing DVD players, who in their right mind could have ever thought where this franchise would end up! It works a lot like an exploitation movie, it got enough commentary and character depths to attract attention to it, but it is clearly contrived in a way that is safe and pleasing to anyone reading in whatever way they want. While some of it feels deeper than the surface-level stuff the bigger films in the franchise pull, some of it is shot stylistically to seem like it's saying something to tell the exact opposite. '
Nonetheless, it's an entertaining film that never stops the rush it has and anything added to it just makes it more appealing even if it is safe and half-assed to look more than it is. Vin Diesel was really perfect in this role with all the positives and negatives in the writing of the whole movie itself clearly reflected in the way he carries the role.",Jithindurden,"Apr 11, 2023"

10,Don't take this movie too seriously(a classic!),"When you watch Fast and the Furious, please don't take it as a serious work of drama.  Watch it as a mindless movie with fast cars and attractive women. With that said you would consider it a masterpiece.True, the movie has bad acting and poor story, but that is what makes it a marvelous popcorn film.  My friends and I spend hours mocking the film and its horrendous dialogue.  The movie is full of silly lines bound to make you laugh.  Just check the memorable quotes section.  There are so many classic scenes that make it a campy movie. Some scenes and dialogue is so ridiculous that it is too much fun to ridicule and imitate.  It so bad it's good. Plus it is very watchable because of the fast cars and hot girls.  I'm not sure if the filmmakers intentionally had the goal of ""so bad it's good"" but the cast and crew have made this into one of the best unintentionally funny films of all time.I urge each living soul to witness this magnificent work of art with an open mind and sense of humor.  You won't regret it.(Another note:  Ja Rule is terrific in this film.  He produces the all-time greatest cameo.  Unintentional or not it is a work of genius in the comedy department.  He is a pure delight to see him on screen.)",hootiefan,"Jul 31, 2002"
7,Think 'Point Break' crossed with 'Gran Turismo'.,"This was an entertaining movie despite being unoriginal.  The characters are suprisingly well-developed, and the cars are pretty cool- though, being from the Detroit area, I was hoping for a bigger dose of Motor City muscle. But, it's true to its So-Cal setting and mindset.  Unfortunately the story has already been done- replace the racers with surfers, the trucks with banks, Vin Diesel with Patrick Swayze and voila, you have Point Break.  Still, it's a joyride to be sure, with awesome (albeit being obviously staged) car stunts and a 'furious' pace.  If you like fast cars and drag-racing, you'll enjoy this movie.",bryanlaszlo,"Jan 9, 2002"
10,"If you haven't seen it, you live under a rock","This movie has by far the best acting in any racing movie I've ever seen. Vin Diesel plays his role extremely well in this film as well as Paul Walker (Brian Spilner) who acts as an undercover cop trying to bust Dominic and his street racing gang. This movie also has some of the best cars and probably the most cars I've seen in a street racing film. In almost every scene there's cars. The film takes a dramatic turn in the end which gives you a rush and thrill as if you were actually in the movie. All in all, I think this movie is perfect for any racing fan or car enthusiast however, it's also extremely entertaining and I think anyone would enjoy this movie.",hiddenwave93,"Apr 11, 2012"
6,Back in simpler times,"This one reminded me of when the Fast and Furious franchise used to be synonymous with racing, when the makers were more concerned with automobiles and the engineering that goes into them than with staging a variety of fast-paced, nonsensical action set pieces.The narratives at that point in time used to be routine though, not much emphasis were given but they had these characters who seemed relevant and to whom one could relate, as opposed to the present scenario where everyone is treated as if they have superpowers.While I adore (to a certain extent) these updated over-the-top world-saving notions, this is not what F&F was set up for. I think that the creators need to go back to their roots, their origins, I feel that's the only path left to redeem themselves as well as this series.",SoumikBanerjee1996,"Jun 9, 2023"

No rating,This movie was kick a$$!!,This movie was the best that i have seen in a while. I saw it as soon as it came out i was there that night it came out and then I went back like 4 more times to see it in the theaters that is how good it was. It was almost like you where in the car with them it gave you the feeling that you where flying down the road at high speeds.All my friends felt the same way about it too. If i could rate this movie i would rate it like 100 out of 10. All those people that said it was bad they don't know wut they are talking about they must not be into those kind of movies because it was tight.I recommend that if u have not seen this then you are missing out and you need to go out and rent it and then buy it.,justchillin3186,"May 20, 2002"
6,GREAT START AHEAD OF THE FRANCHISE,"What I liked most about this movie was the beautiful story and background given to Paul Walker's character. His performance was just good, and his persona seemed like the perfect one for that role. The director was smart in acknowledging the fact that there needed to be a balance of ""fast and furious"" as well as slowness and really taking the time to provide a good story arch and giving justice to the characters portrayed. In my opinion, Vin Diesel's performance was better because it gave more conviction than Paul Walker's. But the action and chase scenes were to die for, and it set the perfect tone for the subsequent films in the franchise.",jeromesgabilo,"Dec 15, 2023"
6,A Fast and Furious movie,"Fast cars. Big engines. Big Egos. High velocity action. Michelle Rodriguez. Definitely one of my favourite films based on these factors. TFATF is a high velocity action packed street-racing movie with a simple plot. the story is cliché ridden but it works well incorporating the street-racing aspect and its characters into it. Although to film critics the film is just a mindless street racing movie with a back-story that was made to entertain audiences under the age of 25. Though it is true that the movie draws its audience through the street-racing aspect.The film is not a cinematic classic, however it cannot be placed as another Gone in 60 Seconds because the two movies are not the same. Although both centred around high powered cars, their plots are significantly different. The plot of TFATF is simple and cliché along with some of the dialogue but it delivers on thrills and high intensity stunts. It falls nothing short of hitting the audience with fast cars, sexy women and heart-pounding stunts.The film can appeal to both male and female audiences; sexy women and fast cars for the guys and the motorheads; and the muscle-bound, action-heroism of Vin Diesel for the ladies.Despite the plot somewhat lacking any depth or complexity, the movie is successful in drawing its target audience of under 25's and proves to be a highly entertaining blockbuster smash.6.5/10",superstar_carnage,"Dec 27, 2007"
10,I couldn't disagree more,"This is a great action movie.  If you're into action and drama, then you'll love this movie.  The racing scenes are very cool, and the in-your-face action keeps you on the edge of your seat.  It entertained me throughout the whole thing, and I'd have to say the acting is a lot better than said by others to be..  The only one lacking to me, was Paul Walker, and, well, we've always known he wasn't much of an actor.. just a pretty face. However, the rest of the cast did an awesome job.  I highly recommend this movie.",strippedandbeaten,"Jun 21, 2002"
7,good...but we've seen it already,"I really thought I'd hate this movie but it wasn't at all bad. In fact, I really enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I was going to. Exciting racing,nice cars and not a bad story...buuuuuuut; it's already been done. The story is so close to Point Break that the writers HAD to have noticed it. Point Break is the better of the two,but I still recommend this one. Now for the other bad stuff....(I'd put this under the goofs section,but it's not available yet). 1- The first streetrace we see lasts far longer than a quarter mile race does,which is NEVER over 20 seconds (unless your car is really really slow or broken). Well,this first race was (roughly) 2 minutes in duration. I know it makes for better action,but it's unreasonable all the same. 2- I don't care how powerful your car is. In the final scene of the movie,Dom does a wheelstand WITHOUT doing a burnout (heats the tires for traction) this is impossible (although great eye candy,the car would do nothing but sit there and spin) and 3- Final scene again. Dom's car apparantly was a 9 second vehicle vs the 10 second import and the race ended neck and neck. There is no way they would end that close if the cars truly ran what they said they did. A full second in a race is a huge gap. If there were a couple of tenths difference,that would be different..but a FULL second? That being said....it was a pretty good movie anyway. 7/10",nivek_nailgun,"Nov 28, 2001"
9,Start of a Franchise!,No content,ShelbyTMItchell,"Apr 17, 2013"
7,Back to simpler times.,"Really brings back to the time when the franchise was not as exaggerated. Despite being cheesy and cliche at times, this movie holds as one of my personal favourites. The plot is simple yet efficiently works. However, the ending felt rushed and anticlimatic to be fair, even with its intense build up. The perfomances are, god moly. Surprised when Vin Diesel went all out in this one, and the rest of the casts perfomances especially Paul Walker, are actually pretty decent and their chemistry makes this movie really fun to watch. It also has cool cars, great action scenes, probably one of the best scores in the franchise, and a lot of hot babes too, I mean I don't know what else to say anymore, so yeah, go for it.",rimuruu,"Oct 20, 2022"
4,"The saving grace of 'The Fast and the Furious' are the highly charged racing sequences, but even those are punctured by Rob Cohen's berserk direction","The Fast and the Furious Every week, trucks containing valuable electronic equipment are hijacked by the expert drivers of super-fast, unmarked cars. In their investigation, the FBI and the Los Angeles police force begin to suspect participants in the vicious, illegal nighttime street-racing wars of committing the crimes. The almost cult-like following that this activity attracts is led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel, 'Pitch Black'), whose more sensible sister Mia (Jordana Brewster, 'The Faculty') is beginning to fall for Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker, 'She's All That'), a new face in the street-racing circuit. But, unbeknownst to Mia or Dominic and his entourage, Brian is an undercover cop who has been assigned to infiltrate their group and try to discover the culprit behind the thefts. But as Brian spends more and more time with the Torettos and their companions, he finds himself torn between his duty as a police officer, and his loyalty as a friend.Aside from the fact that 'The Fast and the Furious' is based on a Vibe magazine article about street-racing written by Ken Li, the script isn't anything special, and seems more heavily inspired by the mediocre Jerry Bruckheimer-produced 'Gone in Sixty Seconds' remake from last year, as well as a 1999 Hong Kong action film, 'The Legend of Speed'. I can forgive the lack of brains presented here, but some actual characters would have been nice, as would capable actors to fill their shoes. Paul Walker does not convince in the lead role, and fails to truly express the emotional byproducts of his character's internal conflict of interests, while Vin Diesel is all too content to let his muscles do the talking. Michelle Rodriguez, as Diesel's moody love interest, is the bright spark within the tedium, but it seems as if she wandered onto the set while filming 'Girlfight' and was instantly hired on the spot. For a mainstream breakthrough, this gifted actress deserved better.The saving grace of 'The Fast and the Furious' are the highly charged racing sequences, but even those are punctured by Rob Cohen's berserk direction. The soundtrack is way off, the camera cramps too close to the action, and what's with all the CGI? ~ 4/10 ~",Extraordinary_Machine,"Mar 7, 2005"
10,Awesome movie.,This movie was totally awesome! I loved it and I can't wait for the sequel. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are two of my favorite actors and Ja Rule is my favorite rapper. Jordana and Michelle totally kicked butt in this movie. They proved chicks rule.,kristinestrada,"Jun 29, 2002"

1,so bad it made me furious,"'The Fast and the Furious' is probably only enjoyable for those cinema-goers who enjoy films about cars and ellaborate chase scenes and for girls who like to see Vin Diesel. This film had nothing going for it whatsoever (unless, of course, you are really into one of those subjects that I just mentioned). The film is all about fast cars and a little bit of crime with 'bad guys/bad girls' image. That sums up the entire film, which leaves little to the imagination and little anything to appreciate.I certainly will not be recommending this film to anyone. Hey, if you like nothing but watching cars race on screen and a little bit of 'bad guy/bad girl' gang life, then I hope you enjoy this. I personally think it is one of the worst movies that I've had the displeasure of seeing.",rebeljenn,"Nov 22, 2005"
No rating,Ordinary-Person oriented-each ticket with a complimentary grain of salt,"This film was a strategically marketed film with a simple idea in mind-sell one ticket to every 18-24 year old male in America. It adapted a simple idea of an ""underground,"" a sub-culture which the majority of persons are not entirely aware of. That was a good idea in and of itself. Allowing the average person a glimpse into an unknown, yet fascinating, world makes for excellent marketing. The more guns, drugs, and cops, the better.Neil Moritz chose to not get picky with details. Well done. Rather, he saw the movie through the demographic's eye. For the most part, we don;t care about cheesy effects and run-ons, as long as the movie keeps it's promise: lots of action with few details. It did.For the car-fanatics out there, myself included, there's a bakers dozen and a half of errors. Who cares? It was good fun if you took it lightly and checked your automotivelly superior attitude at the door. If not, you ended up like most of the posters. Caught up in arrogance.As a whole, this was definitely not Oscar-worthy. Well orchestrated action sequences (it IS Mic Rodgers) and a semi-plausible plot make this a joy to those who accept it for what it is; a fun movie.7.5/10",acd4753-1,"Jan 2, 2004"
7,Switch off and enjoy,"Far from being the most complex movie out there, the fast and the furious is something you don't have to think in depth about to enjoy, fast paced and easy to follow with big action scenes.I absolutely loved this movie when it came out and would have given it 10/10, of course I was 13 at the time, I'm 35 now and although I still enjoy it I'm no longer obsessed with fast cars.I would advise not letting your teenager go out driving right after watching any of the films, especially Tokyo Drift. Trying to leave the cinema carpark as soon as these films finish is a risk with all the young drivers thinking they're Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, indeed Paul Walker can be used as a cautionary tale.",ryan-shaw-627-316495,"Feb 4, 2023"
6,Somehow this is the most grounded entry in the franchise.,"A friend who hasn't seen them wants to go through all the films together. We're one film in and I'm half regretting it and half strapped in for the ride. I've only seen up to 7 before, but the trailers for the films past that are incredible in their own way.This one was actually ok, it made me nostalgic for PS1 games even though I never had that console.There were some surprisingly real human moments and neat stunts spread throughout the film, but the overall experience was marred by some bad CGI, weird NOS logic, and a 10 second drag race that actually had a screen time of two minutes. This isn't anime. I think I have yet to see a drag race on film that's interesting. Isn't most of the fun in the prep?Regardless, I'm kind of shocked that this became a series that's still running (probably on gas by this point) 22 years later, with it's eleventh entry. I wonder what dumb bodywork they'll do on the title.",H4wke,"Nov 6, 2024"
9,Awesome Movie..One of my Favourites from collection :),"Awesome Movie.The best of the Fast and furious collection in my opinion.The best thing is watching the whole collection and then returning back to the first one , that is when you really truly appreciate it for what it is..Seeing Paul walker,Vin diesel and all the other actors together really puts a smile on your face. The only thing i honestly didn't like was, there just wasn't enough action, but then again there isn't too much action like the new ones which just drain your life tbh. Such a great movie which focuses on the main idea of bringing family together.If you haven't watched it your missing out and i suggest that you get onto it straightaway.. Hope you enjoy it as much as i have .. :)",seldaibrahim,"Apr 18, 2015"
7,The name says all,"A few months ago this film burst onto U.S. screens with little or no build up, and became a huge success.With a virtually unknown cast and competition from movies such as Dr Dolittle 2, it made a large impact on the box office, reaching number one. As for the product itself, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality. The movie opens with a spectacular truck hijacking by a group of black high performance cars. The plot then follows the story of Brian, played by little-known Paul Walker, a young car parts salesman who is trying to ingratiate himself into a group of revheads in L.A. After initial resistance, he becomes the protege of their leader Dom, played by Vin Diesel, a minor celebrity actor whose biggest roles were in Pitch Black and Saving Private Ryan. The big letdown is the close similarity between the story and the movie Point Break, except the activity of surfing is replaced by street racing. Paul Walker is certainly no Keanu Reeves, but he doesn't have to be - the cars are the real items of interest in this movie.It happens that Brian is actually an undercover cop, intent on finding the hijackers. He must first prove himself to be a legitimately talented racer as his cover identity. Naturally there's the obligatory love interest for Brian provided by Dom's little sister.The stunts are extremely well staged, almost to the point of believing that they must be computer generated pictures.The races and car chases are totally exhilarating, such that you don't have time to pick holes in the plot or worry about the quality (or lack of) the acting or script. The soundtrack is completely occupied by either cars revving or full force rap/techno music - under no circumstances see this movie with a pre-existing headache - it will be 50 times worse afterwards! That said, I think the sound is wholly appropriate to this film.Make sure you stay until after the closing credits, because it's one of those movies where there's something more for the viewer. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the spectacle.",Benny T,"Nov 26, 2001"
8,fast cars go vroom vroom,"Awesome fun entertaining movie with a great story. The story is a lot more intricate than I remember it being and flows very well. Great characters you immediately become attachment to, with strong development of Brian and Dom's characters.Good creative directing with some BEASTLY action scenes. And even tho most people may disagree, I think paul walker gave a good performance, and the other actors played their roles perfectly. The dialogue was pretty weak. Great musical score and song selection for the soundtrack.This movie is one of my favorites and partially a guilty pleasure movie for me. I think it's really good but at the same time there is a lot you can make fun of, i find myself laughing at those parts, because even though they're bad, i still like them.Watching it again, my love for it continues to increase.

7,"Cliched, shallow ... but very entertaining","This is a movie that works in spite of itself.  Kudos to Vin Diesel, who was the best part of ""Boiler Room"" and shows his acting chops here with little to work with.  He's supported mostly by a pulse-pounding soundtrack of the kind that usually annoys me but here serves to really amplify the thin story line.

Of course all that cars'n'girls stuff was a bit too much for a feminist soul, but I really loved the cool girls Letty and Mia! They just had the right attitude :)The film isn't only about cars'n'girls, it is also about friendship and loyalty and that's very rare in the world of today. And that was something I appreciated a lot. I liked the chemistry between the cop-Brian and the villain-Dominic and the way Brian managed the situation in the end was beautiful.Despite the bad talk, Vin Diesel made great acting and I also enjoyed Paul Walker's character and his struggle in his conflict mind between the cop-consciousness and friendship.",cinna665,"Nov 1, 2002"

Vin Diesel and Paul Walker do a good job carrying this film. Dom (Diesel) is tough and not to be trifled with. Paul Walker walks a fine line to win his trust and learn his operation.This film is an adrenaline rush. You have action, adventure, street racing and a alright story that pulls it together.

That doesn't really matter though, as they become so iconic and its fun to look back on them having seen the later films in the franchise.A very solid and enjoyable film, with a decent plot and energetic film making.

2,The Lame and the Ludicrous,"Where does one begin, coincidentally a dilemma which the director also faced, with considerably less success. I entered this movie with low expectations hoping, vainly, to be surprised. Needless to say it failed to meet even these low expectations. I actually left the cinema, feeling personally insulted that a director could show such contempt for the audience. The acting was uniformally appalling, not in the least part aided by a script that was, quite frankly laughable; 'and if I win, I win the respect.' The actors handled the complexity of human emotions like warring neanderthals; I would be tempted to read into this a brutal misanthropic polemic, though this of course would be crediting the director with far more than he deserves. The very fact that the first hour escaped the cutting room floor is an act of escapology comparable to exploits of Houdini himself. Admittedly, it improved marginally as it progressed, though by this time I was numb, feeling drained, overwhelmed and violated, not least by the almost constant grating noise of screeching engines. Oh yes, and the attempt to get away from crude ethnic stereotypes was... well er absent.  In conclusion if the thought of fast cars, vacuous 'ladies' and at least 10 minutes of fascinating dialogue about car engines has you salivating, then this may, I repeat may, be the film for you. If on the other hand you value the more conventional customs of the film industry; plot, characterization, drama, suspense and intrigue, then please, please avoid.   */***** (this is the first film I've ever reviewed as a *!, it really was that bad!)",loach10,"Sep 16, 2001"
10,One Great Movie,This Movie no matter how you look at it rocked the graphics were superb and the movie just all the way around just was wonderful.  Vin diesel (Dominique) and Paul walker (Brian spillner) did a wonderful job working together on this film.  There isn't much I can say about the movie all that i can say is that if you haven't seen it yet go get it now because you don't realize what your missing,Edge424,"May 24, 2002"
2,What a mess...,"The problem that The Fast and The Furious has is that it is inconsistent. It at times is a police drama, at times a car movie, a gun movie and a romance. As a result, it fails on all counts, and fails spectacularly.
The acting is pitiful, but the writing may be worse. There are times where lines are delivered so poorly that the actors seem to have simply given up trying to salvage the train wreck of a script. The attempts at ""street cred"" are embarrassing (""dawg,"") and the film's method of sounding technically proficient is to deliver lines of dialogue that sound like the actors are reading an inventory list at AutoZone.The most frustrating thing about the movie is that it refused to budge from its somewhat complex story line. While nothing brilliant, the story was more developed that a standard action flick's. This is only a problem because the film was absolutely not up to the task. The action was nonsensical, and surprisingly scarce. The movie lacked a true protagonist because everyone was far too annoying to root for. The actors themselves seemed lost; milling around, reading lines.It is important to mention the cars themselves, though, since this is being billed as a `car movie.' And that depends on what is expected from a car movie. If you are hoping for Camaro SSs and Hemi Cudas, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for Acuras and Hondas, you'll see them. If you're looking for Ronin-style car chases or Blues Brothers silliness, you'll be disappointed. If you want to see tiny cars driving in straight lines in fifteen-second bursts, you'll see it.In the end, the only thing I found at all satisfying was the romance aspect of the movie, which the furthest thing from my mind when I bought my ticket. If I were Vin Diesel, I would have taken one look at the script and one look at my cast mates and then I would have stolen one of their souped up jalopies and hightailed it back to a real movie career.",Rioter,"Jul 24, 2001"
No rating,Mildly entertaining stuff for teenagers  hardly exciting or dramatic enough,"A gang of drivers are pulling off high speed hijacks of trucks and stealing their cargo.  Undercover cop Brian O'Conner is sent in to infiltrate one of the numerous street racing crews who are suspected of the crime.  He wins over Dominic Toretto, the head of one such crew and begins his investigation.  However the closer he gets to the crew and the more he gets into the culture, the harder it is to do his job.One weekend I was considering going to see 2 Fast 2 Furious but decided to go and rent the first movie before I see the sequel or else how would I be able to follow the plot and characters (oh  how optimistic I was!).  So I rented this film knowing that it had received better reviews than the sequel.  I expected stylish thrills and exciting high speed action with a weak plot  I was half right.  The plot was pretty weak and full of clichés  from the `going native undercover cop' to the `urban' lingo that everyone tries to speak in.It doesn't really make much sense and it is a pretty fragile house of cards that comes crashing down logic-wise if you ask too many questions.  However, to focus on the plot here is wasting my time and yours, as it matters little  this is an action movie, not a drama.  I expected the action to be slick and breathless given the speeds involved however I was really disappointed. Aside from a few directorial flourishes that make it all appear much more exciting than it is, the car action is actually quite normal.  Even the climatic hijacking is done with no feeling of `edge of seat thrills' although it looks impressive.  I'm sure many will be taken in by the sheer slickness of the thing, but I found the action to be soulless and lacking in any real excitement.The cast are a line of urban clichés who sound like every suburban teenager in the Western world tries to sound. Walker is bland and manages to make Vin Diesel look like he's acting hard.  In fairness Diesel was responsible for the only scene I found dramatic (where Toretto finds out who O'Conner is) by doing good work with his face  but for the rest he was simply a tough guy lacking in the charisma needed to do a likeable bad guy.  Rodriguez looks good but is better than this.  Brewster is surprisingly plain given the amount of eye candy on display and the rest of the support cast simply mug (Ja Rule included).  More often I found myself watching the crowds who were populated with beautiful girls who were cynically edited in at every chance to try and get the teenage boys coming back for more.  I'm not complaining, but it is hard not to feel a little exploited when the film has a lingering shot of two gorgeous girls snogging for no reason other than visual titillation.Overall, like the cars themselves this is a very slick vehicle but I found it to be ultimately empty and soulless.  The plot is meaningless and the script one cliché after another.  The action scenes are ordinary and it is a major failing of the film that it doesn't manage to translate the thrill of 140 mph races etc onto the screen.  If you want to see a road race done better I suggest an exciting scene in the Jackie Chan 1995 film `Pi li ho'  that I found exciting, this I just found to be hollow and noisy.",bob the moo,"Jun 29, 2003"

7,Don't expect too much but incredible speed and you won't be disappointed,"I must confess to actually reather enjoying the film; whilst there was little in the way of plot, the actors are no better or worse than the majority of the Hollywood lot these days. The cars were awesome (as the owner of a MKIII Supra I enjoyed that aspect) and the sound and ethos was very immersive, but there wasn't a huge amount of intelligent dialogue. The actors weren't bad - the characters just weren't overly deep.That said, ask yourself why you watched the film. Was it for the undercover cop story, admittedly done a thousand times? Or was it to see THOSE CARS move? I think that that last, as the films focus, was done incredibly well, and the actors did a good job of being the varied and individual if somewhat cliched drivers, which is essentially what they were there for.

8,Fast & Furious Beginning,"This is first movie of the Fast & Furious franchise it has a solid plot and a nice finish scene which leave place for next movie. It's a great movie for all, especially for car lovers. Movie is full of tuned cars, hot girls and races. Old school street racing (1/4 of a mile, NOS in cars). Cars like Toyota Supra, Honda Civic and American classic Charger. It is nice treat for all car lovers. When you hear that engine sound and that NOS boost you just wanna get there and race. Racing and chasing is pretty much realistic. But movie is not all about racing it gives connection between main characters that will last trough other movies. It is very underrated movie. I rated it 8 cause of his lack of action. It has nice plot so you won't get bored at all but there is something missing. All in all I recommend this movie for everyone who is interested in cars you will enjoy it.",BearGlove,"May 27, 2013"

1,this movie is terrible,there are few pieces of cinema that fail so spectacularly as this does. it's pathetic how bad this movie is. the plot is weakly written and the characters are poorly developed and the dialog is unnatural and awkward. do yourself a favor and stay away. I don't know why the makers of this film decided to go through with production on a movie with such limited appeal. it is without a shadow of a doubt one of the biggest wastes of time and money I've ever seen. all this movie did for me was call into question the quality of the acting ability for all those involved in this bomb. vin diesel is a terrible actor and this movie is bad even by his standards. paul walker as the undercover cop is hard to identify with. many of the roles in this movie are completely unrealistic and lame.,coreyg069,"Apr 23, 2006"
10,A great movie,"This is the BEST movie ever made ( if you are in to cars and racing ). The cars are awesome and the girl are nice too.

7,Vin Diesel - TRUE ASSET,"Last night, I saw a sneak preview of this movie and I can be honest that I was disappointed in some of the race scenes.  There was an expectation of gravity defiance in the race scenes, nothing really came of that until the end of the flick.  So, if you want a virtual rush, sleep until the end. THE BEST part of this flick is the acting ability in Vin Diesel.  Yes, this guy actually pulls this movie and you along for a good ride that ends with interest.  Camera slowly zooms in on Vin as he tells of the story of his father and his racing days.  Great scene with a lot of drama.  He is the only reason this film deserves to be seen.",matthew5and9,"Jun 13, 2001"
2,"Boy, oh boy, did this suck.","This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  I didn't want to see his movie, but my friends really wanted to see it bad. It was sold out, but we got into the 12:15am show time and the theater was packed! AT 12:15!! I don't understand what the appeal of this movie is. A bunch of fast cars? Fast cars does not a good movie make.The dialogue of this movie was terrible. There wasn't anything interesting said the whole time.  My friends (who LOVED the movie) tried to defend it saying that they talked like real people talk. Well, if I want to see real people talk I'll go to the barber shop or something; somewhere where I don't have to pay $8.25. Such lines as ""It doesn't matter if you win by an inch or a mile, winning is winning."" and ""I'll have the tuna fish,"" are the most memorable, and believe me they really sucked.The plot hardly got in the way of the blatant attempt to make a movie just for the reason of a bunch of cars going really fast. And audiences couldn't WAIT to see a bunch of cars going really fast. Maybe these people should watch NASCAR or something, then they won't have to worry about ignoring some piddly plot. If you want to see a GOOD movie with cars see Bullitt.Who hired these actors? ALL of them were terrible especially Vin Diesel who sleeps through the movie. My guess is they spent so much money on the cars that they could only afford to hire fifth rate actors.I gave this movie a 2 out of 10. The only reason it didn't get a 1, is because of the cars, if the scenes with the cars were surrounded by something that didn't make me want to ride the bus from now on, then maybe it could've gotten a higher rating.",hydrofuzz,"Jun 23, 2001"
No rating,I LOVED IT!,"I loved it a lot, but the final scene, when Jesse is shot, was really sad. They dwelled less on it than they did with Vince (the guy who everyone hates!) getting hurt.

6,"Good acting, good action, poor plot","The plot for this film is pretty weak, Brian is an undercover cop (is he a good one - umm not really) trying to bust a hijacking ring, falls into a team of racers and decides to choose them over the law. The acting isn't too bad, vin diesel and Paul walker hold their own, and the supporting ladies bring their A game. The action / car racing is pretty good, it's the early ages of CGI so the shots aren't the best, but most of the real racing holds its own. It's a fairly good movie, just lacks depth on the plot, jumps around and doesn't explore any of the characters too deep.",Calicodreamin,"Aug 9, 2019"
8,The fast and the awesomeness 🌟 8/10,"These people sure are fast. And furious. I'm a big of the fast and furious series. Sad to hear Paul walker died. Loved that guy. He was the best of them all. I love racing. Action, and lambriginie cars. This movie has it all. Dom is fast and strong. Vin deasel was perfect for the role. Same with Brian O. Coner. I thought him and Mia were gonna get married but they didn't. It also had a lot of hot girls. They always do. But I was surprised it was rated PG 13. I thought it should've been because of the profanity. But it was great anyway. But the film wasn't really about Dom. Mostly about Brian. If this wasn't good the furious series never would've started. Even though it's just Action for action, it was entertaining. Also, I learned a lesson from this movie.

The least one could ask for is a plot that REMOTELY pulled your mind in any way....not. Or an actor that did remind you that acting was part of a movie....no.

It's also well paced with a good focus on family.",masonsaul,"Jul 26, 2019"
7,A veritable cornucopia of beautiful cars,"This was a very low brain celled, high testosterone script, but it worked. Or maybe that's just because I'm a guy. It may have very well been enough to see gorgeous tricked out Japanese cars racing each other, but it was enhanced by some very good camera work and special effects. If you closed your eyes and just listened to the movie, you would probably be driven to lay yourself in the path of one of these cars because the dialogue and acting was so God awful. But if you were to do the opposite, meaning close your ears and just watch, you would have been privy to a marvelous treat. I found it very telling about the pulse of the American public when ""The Fast and Furious"" pulled in a lot of dough while Stallone's ""Driven"" did poorly. One point for the street racers: zero for the pros.",view_and_review,"Jun 19, 2007"
1,"The cars are fast, but the acting made me furious.....","What do you get when you take Days of Thunder, add in two younger actors, and two equally attractive young actresses, and then put it all on the streets?  A good idea.  However, the additions of such clueless individuals as Ja Rule, and many other small players made my head hurt.  The stunts were great, the cars were ""Pretty"" fast, and the women....nice.  The script, ohhhhh my god, it made me wish I was watching Prison of the Dead. Now....another question...What do you get when you have two bad actors staring in a movie with a horrible script?  Several things.  One, an unemotional reading of the lines on the screen which came across as totally bland and seemed like it was a cold reading.  Two, moments that were supposed to be funny, but just couldn't pull it off.  Third, same as the latter, but with emotional moments.  Fourth......one really bad and shameless plug....""You can have any brew you want, as long as it's a Corona.""  Ow! My aching head! Ow!This movie does not deserve praise, it does not deserve to be making the money it has been, and I want my two hours of living back that I wasted giving this film a chance.What have we learned from this?

No rating,The best races on the streets,"This movie shows what people mad about racing cars can make. It's absolutely awesome that any of those cars can reach such high speed in the streets of an American big city. This is due to the good quality of the asphalt and the skills of the drivers. One thing that impressed me was the Detroit-made car driven by Toretto.America looks like an awesome country.Dominic Toretto is an American car builder who has the reputation of being the best at everything that has something to do with gasoline. And Vin Diesel carries out his task with an awesome performance.Paul Walker is another great American actor, very handsome, who plays a good-guy who is loyal first and foremost to his buddies. He would never let them down. He shows a fascinating charisma and that is what make a difference. The style of American customized cars is astonishing and you will dream with those cars for a while.

7,One of a kind of the series,"There's a good love story wrapped around the manifolds and superchargers.Its about a series of truck high-jacks has brought in a squad of undercover cops to deal with the problem and they do so by sending Officer Brian Earl Spilner (real name Brian O'Conner) (Paul Walker) to infiltrate the number one racing clan. It's led by Dominic ""Dom"" Toretto (Vin Diesel), the fastest and strongest among 'em. O'Conner starts his quest by demonstrating his hangup with speedy metal, then by hanging around Dom's bar, which Dom's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) runs and bartends. In the course of events he loses his ride, saves Dom's life and some embarrassment, hooks up with Mia, and learns to respect Dom in ways he never expected.The racing sequences are brought off with considerable energy and as an expression of this culture but are weakened by a plot device contrived to give the races and the racers a dynamic advantage. The movie had a decent plot but the writing and dialogue was poor. Many people consider the first one the best of the series and I agree with them on some levels. Though had the writing and dialogue been better, this film would have been much better. Also they could have used better character development and better acting. Its a film centered at a specific group. Meaning not for everyone. As a rewatch 06/03/19', the original Fast and the Furious shows how everything was set up. A solid debut and shows the early stages of how this become a dynasty in the making.",Floated2,"Sep 8, 2010"

7,Improbably cool.,"On one level, ""The Fast and the Furious"" is two hours of machismo. But on another level, it does show the subculture of street racing. Before it came out, I'd never known that people soup their cars up with nitrous oxide to increase speed. Vin Diesel plays his typical role, and Paul Walker almost seems like a side character.I should identify that much of the movie looks pretty improbable. I won't divulge the scenes right here for risk of spoiling the movie, but trust me: you'll know these scenes when you see them. But like I said, the movie does give one an insight into the world of street racing.

Expect no surprises from the thin script, just hot metal, great tunes, flash and pizzaz.  Paul Walker is the GQ-Pretty Anglo love interest.  Jordan Brewster plays Diesel's baby sister.  Both are pros, but they pale against the impact of Diesel and Rodriguez.  Also of special note are Giovanni Ribisi-clone Chad Lindbert as Jesse and Matt Schulze as Vince, Diesel's childhood buddy and Walker's rival for Brewster.

1,A sexist racist pile of poop,"Oh dear.Where do we start?Let's ignore the fact that this film was poorly plotted, poorly scripted, badly conceived and reminiscent of the tackiest MTV video you can think of. Let's remain blissfully unaware of the production values that would make yesterdays breakfast look like a five course dinner. Let's also overlook the poorest acting I've seen from young Hollywood ""talent"" since Sunset Beach.Yes, lets.Okay, onto the REALLY objectionable stuff...Firstly, the only oriental characters involved are not only street punk goons but also the primary bad guys. Okay, so the main goon's dad is in it too for about five seconds and isn't very happy at his sons conduct, but this is hardly an excuse to have such a racially imbalanced plotline. This is the 21st century and this cowboys and indians style concept is worthy of a prison sentence, particulary as it comes from a country where racial equality is considered to be a key issue.Secondly, we see lots and lots of cars and... guess what? Oh yes, women wearing next to nothing running around allowing their drivers to fondle their ""assets"", then offering threesomes. Despite the fact that the realisim factor is minute - surely most women would despair of a guy who's life revolved around his car - it also portrays an image of women as mere sex objects to pleasure guys in fast cars. Again, we have one token female who is a racer, but this hardly makes this kind of imagery morally sound, and the camera still takes time to wander over her person with an almost feral attention to detail.By portraying these women as trophies, it suggests that irresponsible behaviour such as street racing can earn you sexual favours. This is of course complete rubbish in the case of nearly every single woman with an IQ above 0.2.Finally, I would just like to point out that the entire plot and premise of the film displays a complete lack of belief in safe, responsible driving. Not a single seatbelt is seen throughout the entire film, people have horrific accidents in their cars then stroll out completely unscathed, and not once did I see a crash helmet or protective clothing except on the ""oriental bad guy goons"". What sort of message is that sending out to our 13 and 15 year olds as they begin to reach the age where they can legally drive?To sum it up, this is a meathead movie, made for meatheads by meatheads.

It knows exactly what it is and who it caters to and doesnt try to be anything else but an over the top racing flick. If you go into it expecting a deep introspection into Paul Walker's character, you'll be thoroughly disappointed.

1,what the hell was that?!,"I'll tell you what ... THE worst movie ever made.  I can't even believe I paid the $5 to rent this piece of DVD-Trash and I feel even worse for those who paid much more to see it in the theatre.Where to begin, where to begin.  Why not start with the plot, since people here keep saying it doesn't matter.  Okay okay, so there actually was no plot, but that's not going to stop me from ranting.  This movie had no focus or direction.  In the beginning it's this kid wanting to be a street racer. Then he's a cop trying to stop an electronics theft ring. Then it's some half baked attempt at a love story ala Romeo & Juliet with the kid and the family who doesn't accept him. Then it's a story about ripping off some truck.  Oh ya, and the occasional car race.  And as if that couldn't get any better, this movie even comes complete with an evil Chinese syndicate(could we get any more stereotypical????).I guess I should talk about the cast now.  Um ... ya, what an amazing cast of stellar bad-actors.  Yeesh!  Although I suppose it's not all their fault (well, except for Vin Diesel), most of the blame belongs to the awful script and terrible dialogue.  I watched Jordana Brewster for 3 years on As The World Turns, she's a good actress.  She was great over on ATWT.  But here... the height of her performance is the frequent use of ""Stop the bulls&@% !!!!"".  Paul Walker, he may be good, he may not be.  You can hardly judge by this movie and I havent seen him in anything else.  To me, it seemed like a classic case of casting based upon looks.Speaking of bad dialogue.  The absolute worst element in this movie was all the male ego BS.  The worst example of this was the ending scene with Paul Walker and Vin Diesel.  Paul Walker's character, the cop (just thought I'd reiterate this) was chasing down Vin Diesel's character in one of the movie's few car chases.  Diesel's car is smashed into by a truck and the car's totaled.  Walker pulls his gun on him and looks like he's going to do his job and arrest him.  But what does he do?  Hands him the keys to his car and says ""I still owe you a 60 second car"" and lets him ride off.  Then the movie ends.  Hopefully, what we didn't see was Walker's character suspended from the force, followed by a hearing, followed by an arrest and sentencing for Aiding and Abetting.Now this wouldn't be a good review if I didn't mention the car stuff. Firstly I found it extremely annoying that this movie threw in so much car gibberish that the average movie goer like myself had absolutely no clue what was being said.  Second, the car stunts were few and extremely lacking in excitement.  How exciting is it to see a car go in a straight line?  Not very.  How exciting is it to see 5 cars try and rob an 18 Wheeler?  It probably was, but by that point in the movie I simply didn't care.  And also... if the truck driver is shooting at you with a rifle ... why are you still chasing him?  To save some redneck who most of the characters don't seem to like, and end up killing two of the people you do like?I could go on and on about the flaws and annoyances of this movie ... but I don't have the time.  I like action movies ... when they're GOOD.  But this was not good, not by a long shot.",AndrewHatch,"Feb 14, 2002"
No rating,Turn Off the Brain and Enjoy,"The Fast and the Furious (2001)*** (out of 4)Brainless but entertaining action film about cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) who goes undercover to get inside the street racing crowd so that he can try to bring down a group hijacking semi trucks. He gets in good with Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew but of course they don't know his true identity. THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS isn't to be taken serious because if you did then you'd see one flaw after another in regards to the story itself. Like a lot of summer blockbusters, this one here has had way too many Red Bulls as every single scene is just over-the-top and has some testosterone going overboard. That's not to say this is a bad thing because there's no question that the film remains entertaining as a pure action movie as we're given some likable characters as well as some great racing scenes. I think most people are going to be coming to this thing for the fast cars and the various chases and this here is where the film won't let you down. There are some terrific stunt sequences, although I will admit that a few of them appear to be too much CGI and not enough actual driving. With that said, there are some great ones here including the ending, which I won't spoil here. It also doesn't hurt that we're given some characters that we can like even if I think the screenplay doesn't do a couple of them justice. Both Walker and Diesel are very believable in their roles as is Michelle Rodriquez, Jordana Brewster and even Ted Levine in his role. I will say at times it's somewhat hard to root for the main guys even though we do like this. This is especially true during the final sequence when the truck is being hijacked. Still, THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS is a fun ride as long as you don't expect some serious piece of art.",Michael_Elliott,"Feb 27, 2013"
7,"The Fast and the Furious (2001) - Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, Start Your Engines!","Known as the first film in the ""Fast and the Furious"" series, this thrilling street-racing action flick brought a start to a daring and explosive franchise. Paul Walker plays LAPD officer Brian O' Connor, who is sent undercover to investigate a gang of street-racers, all portrayed by Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, Jordana Brewster as his sister Mia, and Michelle Rodriguez as his girlfriend Letty. But then, he starts having feelings for this particular group, and has no idea whether to bust them or not. This really is a thrilling, and exciting film. Who doesn't enjoy watching car races, hot ladies, and rocking music? The race scenes are exciting and fun, and they steal the whole movie. But I don't really think this movie should be called an ""excellent"" movie, but instead a ""cool"" movie. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are two of the toughest guys ever seen on film, so it was really fun watching them racing cars, shooting guns, and beat up people. But neither one of them gives a special performance. The story may sound like a crazy concept, but it is original. It's neither a remake or a reboot of classic car race films. Anyways, if you're interested in watching a classic movie with chase scenes, hot ladies, explosive bombs, and tons of violence, you won't be disappointed.

7,A classic!,"""The Fast and the Furious"" (2001) is a thrilling ride into the world of underground street racing. Set against the backdrop of Los Angeles, it merges the raw energy of the early 2000s with the burgeoning car culture of the millennium. The movie's heart lies in its iconic cars, which are not just vehicles, but symbols of freedom, power, and identity. As the first installment of a now legendary franchise, it establishes a world where loyalty, honor, and the thrill of the race reign supreme. Its authenticity in portraying street racing culture, combined with a compelling storyline and memorable characters, cements its status as a classic.

9,My opinion.,"Real good movie ,in purpose that i´m a sucker for ""import-style"" cars. Not too good actors, but what the heck, you don´t look at XXX-movies because of the ""good"" storyline? One of the worst things about this movie is that they included Vin Diesel (Dominick Toretto) as a co-star. I don´t like that at all because he´s probably the worst actor since... Well i can´t even recall an even worse actor. Probably Vanilla Ice in that high school movie. I can´t even recall the title of it. Paul Walker isn´t that good either. But then again. It´s the cars that plays the leading roles of this movie. Just a little too much Honda Civics",dieter_hockenheim,"Mar 24, 2004"

9,Good film,"I'll start with the fact that the late Paul Walker was filming here, everyone's favorite Paul Walker left a lot of positive emotions in the first part and the rest, where he starred, strongly merged into the film. The first parts of the afterburner differed from others in that there is physics here, it's nice to watch, there is logic, it's really a movie about cars, street racing, but it's not an action movie like in modern afterburners, where there's even no stupid logic. In general, the film is 10/10, the beginning of the afterburner industry, when you were really sitting waiting for other parts, they don't do that anymore. Definitely the best in parts.

It maybe took a little bit of brain power to believe anyone was making any of the decisions anyone made in this movie.I wondered if street races are a real thing and it turns out it's based on a news article, so I guess it is a real thing!The second thing this film made me wonder is how often people in LA can't get to work on time cuz streets are closed to film car chases.I...feel compelled to watch the rest of the series as I don't understand what could happen next.",kyla-72302,"Aug 30, 2023"
3,subtle and nuanced,"Uhhh... didn't they already, like, do all of this in Point Break? Same freakin' movie, just not as good. Not that Point Break is ""Raging Bull"" or anything, it's just that this movie (Fast and the Furious) tries SO HARD to make sure that ALL THAT ATTITUDE is RIGHT IN YOUR FACE. Point Break at least had a little laid back surfer dude 'tude to it (although, we finally figured out that Keanu wasn't actually ACTING in that movie). Plus, Fast and the Furious lacks that world class quote a la ""I. am an EFF-BEE-YI A-gent. I. CANNOT. ROB. a BANK!"" The best The Fast and the Furious can muster is ""If I win, I get the money...

7,"Stay 'til the very end, after the credits roll, for the conclusive ending","I wouldn't call this 'trashy' goods. It's a perfectly good Hollywood script. Besides the car 'dueling' action sequences, it includes energy of the younger set (20 something's), the eagerness to experience risks, and the plight to feel the spirit of freedom - even if it's a matter of moments. Death is not an ominous worry to them. They live for the moment.
Paul Walker is in the lead role of Brian, the undercover LA cop. He has worked with director Rob Cohen before in ""The Skulls"" 2000. Rob Cohen directed the ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"" 1993 with Jason Scott Lee and Lauren Holly. Also ""Dragonheart"" 1993, a fable of a legend with Sean Connery doing voice of the Dragon which Dennis Quaid gallantly duels with. Cohen's movies may be Hollywood, yet they tend to have a backbone ethical/living outlook that prompts the integrity of the central character(s).
Vin Diesel is Dominic, the rebellious one here - can past as James Dean, the leader whom the gang looks up to. He stood out in ""Boiler Room"" 2000, opposite Giovanni Ribisi, and was the only good thing in ""Pitch Black"" 2000, the sci-fi flick which he was the lead opposite Radha Mitchell (from ""High Art"" 1998 opposite Ally Sheedy.)Jordana Brewster was last seen as the furiously grieving sister of Cameron Diaz in ""The Invisible Circus"" playing opposite Christopher Eccleston (who's in ""Gone in 60 Seconds,"" another fast cars and chase flick). Brewster is Dominic's feisty sister Mia, furiously sulky here besides having a chance to be fast (driving, matching up to the testosterone bunch.) Michelle Rodriguez is Dominic's woman, full of anger within, charged with a devil may care defiance. The role of Johnny by Rick Yune has a flavor of Giovanni Ribisi's energy as in ""Gone in 60 Seconds."" But Cohen's ""The Fast and the Furious"" is comparably more substantial and colorful in storyline and character development, even comes with a 'dream' quote for the fast and the furious: ""I live my life quarter of a mile per second at a timenothing else mattersin those 10 seconds, I'm free."" And the backbone that held together the friendship between Walker and Diesel's characters is soundly strong.
Be sure to stay on to the very end of the movie - after all the credits roll, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker you'll see, and you get to hear Dominic's quote once again (besides receiving a satisfying closure to the story.)",ruby_fff,"Jul 21, 2001"
1,Awful movie...,No content,kurkosdr,"Jan 22, 2009"
No rating,begins well then careens downhill,"In its early stages, `The Fast and the Furious' offers promise that it will become a kind of street-smart, urban version of `American Graffiti' for the new millennium.  It is, alas, a promise that goes largely unfulfilled when the film decides to go the `Donnie Brasco' route instead (although this ain't no `Donnie Brasco').  Like `American Graffiti,' this movie peers into a culture centered largely around automobiles  although in this case it involves high-speed street racing rather than mere cruising.  Unlike Lucas' classic, however, `The Fast and the Furious' betrays its milieu by incorporating a trite tale of an undercover cop (cherubic, squeaky-clean Paul Walker) sent in to infiltrate the cruisers led by Vin Diesel, who appear to be running an elaborate, but actually rather incredible and impracticable, truck hijacking business.  Thus, we are left to endure the inevitable moral conflicts that arise when the cop falls in love with the leader's sister and he begins to feel `sympathy' for the man he is supposed to betray. We could forgive the fact that the dialogue is incredibly inane and the characterizations nonexistent if the film had at least stayed true to its first 40 minutes of nonstop action.  Director Rob Cohen brings a real style and feeling for visual composition to these early scenes, punctuated by incredible stunt work and lightning-paced editing.  The film also captures the feel of urban street rhythms in its musical soundtrack (although you may feel somewhat assaulted by all the visual and aural over-stimulation if you happen to be 25 years of age or older).  In fact, if `The Fast and the Furious' had stayed in this mode throughout, it might even have become an epochal film for the teens of its era.  In this early part, the film's characters pose and strut and drip attitude in a way that becomes emblematic of the trendy youth culture of the time.  Instead, the film becomes just another trite police melodrama straight off the film-factory assembly line. 
That's really a shame because the stunt work is phenomenal throughout, and Vin Diesel conveys a kind of raw animal magnetism that bodes well for his future in action cinema.  He has a way of commanding the audience's attention every time he makes an appearance on screen.  The cars too are spectacular, although they are so overloaded with computer gizmos and jet propulsion devices that one begins to wonder if NASA itself didn't design and build them.Had it been willing to forego the standard plot mechanics and been content to afford us a glimpse into the life of the street-racing culture, `The Fast and the Furious' might have ended up as a `classic' of youth action cinema. Instead, it becomes just another dumb movie with some really neat car chases.",Buddy-51,"Feb 19, 2002"

8,FatF - 20th Century Highwaymen,"For those of you that like Cars, this is the movie to see. For those of you that like racing, this is the movie to see. If you like the trailer see the movie, if not don't.  This is an inside look at the world of Street Racing. The Who, the How, and the Where.  Vin Diesel is great as the Alpha Male, always in control. It is not NASCAR, and it is not just a ""Car Movie"". It is about people and the interaction. It is a mystery and a journey through a way of life.  The final scene and my personal favorite shows how the old Muscle Car(s) compare to the Modern speed racer (w/ NOS)",delavega-1,"Aug 27, 2002"
6,Diesel Show,"While Paul Walker is the Protagonist (main role) in this movie, Vin Diesel steals the show. Apart from the car stunts that is. Because if you don't have good stunts, than the movie doesn't work at all. The story as it is, is pretty cliché, but it's nice fun and it's also watchable.Especially because as mentioned, because of a mesmerizing (for this genre) performance from Vin Diesel. A few flops later and nobody remembered why he was called the new Action Hero, but watching this (and of course the superb ""Pitch Black"") might remind you why you liked him in the first place (or could be a reason to discover him for a younger audience). Cars, women, insane stunts, solid/decent acting (for this genre) and nice characters ... what more could you ask for, from a movie like this? Not much more I think :o)",kosmasp,"Aug 11, 2009"
9,Great film,"The film has it all, superb soundtrack, ace cars and an all-star cast. Make no mistake, this film is loud, and loud is good, watch it, if only for the cars!  The plot is a little too weak for my liking but once you have figured it out it won't distract you from the film.  Once you start watching the film raises your enjoyment level to over 200mph with a big grin on your face.  Definitely recommended for car fans!",ryujingt3,"Apr 16, 2002"
7,Vin Diesel's breakthrough role...,"Paul Walker is an undercover cop from LA trying to infiltrate a street racer gang suspected of having some kind of connection with hijackings in the area.  Vin Diesel is the leader of the gang with the fastest hot rod in LA.The plot for this movie is superb!  With the headbanger's music in the background, it's the perfect setting for the younger crowd of today.  The special effects in this film is all right, but not that spectacular.  Walker makes this role work, but the only thing I don't believe is that he doesn't have some kind of partner working a little closer.  He's just a little too young for this kind of take on...but, then again, I thought Brian Bosworth was a useless piece of work when it came to the movie, ""Stone Cold.""

Those are some pretty cars.  And they go really fast.  Yeeeeha.  That's cinematic genius.I guess in some ways it makes sense though.  You can't afford good writers, good actors, and cool cars.

7,"A good, fun movie, but nothing more","I am not a car person.  I try to be, but I'm sadly am not.  All of my friends are (or at least most of them) but it's something I never fell into as a kid.  Movies are my thing, not cars.  So, here I am, review The Fast and the Furious, and guess what? I loved it.I love a good car chase.  Nothing in this world can impress me more than a good car chase.  To this day, RONIN still has the best chases (with maybe the Blues Brothers coming in second), but The Fast and the Furious makes a valiant effort.  Okay, TFATF has a plot recycled from Point Break (which is justt slightly a better movie).  Sure, the car chases will inspire teens to drive like stampeding cows.  But, this is the best dumb movie of the summer.Tomb Raider was stupid beyond belief.  Pearl Harbor was like a dumb blond, she looks good but we all no there is no brain in her head.  The Mummy Returns was just one long action sequence with bad special effects. Swordfish tried to be smart (and was, for the most part).  But the Fast and the furious knows that it isn't the smartest girl at the ball, and it admits it.  This movie is about cars, babes, and, ummm, more cars.Yea, all of the cars are rice burning Hondas or Mitshubishis.  There is ONE Volkswagon though...So, it's not too bright, but it's fun.  If you liked Point Break, you'll like this.7/10",Keyser Soze-12,"Jul 7, 2001"
7,Tuner cars in this movie.,"Is it just me? Or would most of the cars in this movie be a bit faster if they removed the 200lbs of stereo equipment? I have built some hobby type cars for racing, Nothing to serious. And I was always in the mind-set of when you want to go faster in the 1/4 mile the easiest and cheapest way is to remove some weight. Don't get me wrong I enjoy a good system like most. But if I was racing my car I wouldn't have all the weight of the subs amps extra batteries etc. Other than that and some of the cheesy ""hollywood"" lingo about car terms. I did enjoy the movie for what it is. All in all I would give this movie props for the good visuals and some nice rides.",wangus_mcfatty,"Jun 12, 2006"
9,Good fast,"I'll start with the fact that the late Paul Walker was filming here, everyone's favorite Paul Walker left a lot of positive emotions in the first part and the rest, where he starred, strongly merged into the film. The first parts of the afterburner differed from others in that there is physics here, it's nice to watch, there is logic, it's really a movie about cars, street racing, but it's not an action movie like in modern afterburners, where there's even no stupid logic. In general, the film is 10/10, the beginning of the afterburner industry, when you were really sitting waiting for other parts, they don't do that anymore. Definitely the best in parts.",alinasidorova82726263672,"Jan 19, 2022"
7,Point Break meets racers.,"The Fast and the Furious is not too bad.  The plot line is predictable but is presented in a way that makes it entertaining.  There are some scenes that are not believable and could have been better.  The most glaring are the robbery scenes.  It is just a miss match that is so obvious the director ignores until the end of the film.  The acting of Pawl Walker as Brian O'Conner and Vin Diesel as Domminic Toretto are not bad.  There are few difficult scenes that will make you wince but overall it is workable.  The chase scenes are generally good but the opening scenes is painful to watch.  It just does not appear plausible and does not make much sense.  Overall, not bad (7 out of 10).",rastaban3,"Feb 21, 2002"
8,Pretty damn good!!!!!,"I wasn't too sure about seeing this film when I first heard about it but I thought I would give it a chance anyway. Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster are worth the admission fee alone,Rodriguez looks extremely hot and will keep you looking for more.  If thats not enough there is action as well. Not to mention the amazing cars.The music only adds to the greatness of it.  Especially Ja Rule his sound track captures the mood of the film perfectly. I would give this film an 8 or 9 out of Ten and would recommend it to any film fan.Vin Diesel and Paul Walker seem to work well together and if you are taking a girl to see it it might just keep them interested in the film as well.",braveheart_alloa,"Jun 6, 2002"

1,Stupid Movie Splattered with Feminist Propaganda,"Horrible movie! Why is that everything coming out of Hollyweird has two major problems? One, the women are made to act like men. They dress more shabbily than the male characters, they have more physical strength than the male characters, they have more scientific aptitude than the male characters, they display more willpower than the male characters. The public seems to feed off this perverted view of modern women. Two, the plot in these movies is a joke. What's so difficult about making a normal movie that takes some brains to follow? All these films have explosions, more explosions, and then some more explosions. The style of filming is also becoming darker, more syncopated, especially the fight scenes. Ditch these garbage films NOW!!",Abusimble1,"Oct 24, 2007"

Every scene is unrealistic...But why do we watch movies? We watch because we enjoy them. And I can't help but enjoy this film.It almost feels like it's in the same world as Training Day. Not as dark (and certainly not nearly as good as Training Day). But it captures LA very well. And nostalgia runs through this film like crazy. Makes me sad to know those days are over.

7,Very good entertainment,"I had initially dismissed this movie as just mere satisfaction for the testosterone seeking crowd of young teenage males enthralled by 'fast cars and hot women' but after having viewed the film I was surprised by how much I liked it. Yes those aforementioned elements are addressed much to the appreciation of the film's target audience I'm sure but Vin Disel and especially Paul Walker's charisma made their characters very interesting and even sympathetic. I actually cared about their fates. The rest of the supporting cast also complemented the leads nicely, especially Rick Yune (Die Another Day). I'm not really that fascinated by cars (I think they are noisy and pollutive) but this introduction to the street racing sub-culture was informative. The stunts were also nicely done with minimal special effects. Solid escapism, 7/10.",perfectbond,"Feb 26, 2004"
1,"Stupid, stupider, stupidest, duhhhhhhh.","Some movies drop clues (albeit small) that allow you to believe, even in retrospect, that you could have ""solved the crime.""  Even if this movie is more concerned with the milieu of this racing society and the relationships among the characters, it needs logical plot development.  The fact that it doesn't have it aside, perhaps, from the ""revelation"" that the ""team"" must be getting all that money SOMEWHERE (something that could be said about just about every ""team"" out there), is the major weakness of the film.  In fact, one senses the only reason the guilty party IS the guilty party is because the writers sat around drinking a little too much Corona and decided, in their drunken state, that it would be cool to have those people be guilty...of course because it would maximally affect one particular relationship...which, of course, leads to the huge cop-out of an ending. Teens across the country will be declaring that this movie is ""true"" and ""real"" - I guess because it puts relationships and ""honesty"" within relationships above everything else.

I also think that the end of the movie sets up beautifully for a FAST AND THE FURIOUS part 2.Because it doesnt tell u wat happens to Leon,Letty,Vince,Dom,Brian or Jesse..I think anyone who has anything bad to say about this movie should get punched in the face just like Dom did to Johnny Tren!BY the way i'd pick half those car's from the movie over any girl any day!!!",shroomzrocka,"Jul 30, 2002"

I just watched Fast Furious 9 and I am so dissapointed with F9.. This one is the beginning ... Newer Fast Furious movies just go in the WRONG direction... They should focus with street racing just like this one... I really like street racing movie just like Fast Furious 1 and FF tokyo drift... Fast Furious 1 IMO is the best from all FF movies so far... The storyline is good... Acting was superb.... Plot and character development is good... Music is good.... And awesome street racing scenes!.... I wonder why this have low score review? ...

6,Fast-Paced Action and Drama,"Set in Los Angeles, this movie focuses on a team of thieves who hijack trucks operating a high speeds from optimally powered race cars. The cargo is then taken and sold on the black market. Needless to say, the FBI and local authorities are anxious to capture and prosecute these criminals before the truckers take matters into their own hands. To help them on this case a young police officer by the name of ""Brian O'Conner"" (Paul Walker) volunteers to go undercover and infiltrate the most high-profile illegal street racing team in the area which is led by a man named ""Dominic Toretto"" (Vin Diesel) who also has a prison record for violence due to his explosive temper. However, in order to investigate this case Brian first has to get inside this close-knit team and that is more difficult than anybody realizes. Additionally, this particular team is but one of many and it might not be the one responsible. But one thing is sure-action needs to be taken soon before violence erupts on the highways. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film has enough fast-paced action and drama to satisfy most fans of the genre. No doubt about it. On a more critical note though, I thought that some of the characters-most notably ""Letty"" (Michelle Rodriguez), ""Vince"" (Matt Schulze) and ""Hector"" (Noel Gugliemi)--were much too pretentious and almost to the point of being downright annoying. Likewise, some of the previously mentioned action scenes were more than a little unrealistic as well. But that's Hollywood for you. In any case, from what I understand this film has turned into a profitable enterprise for Universal Pictures and since nothing succeeds like success has bred numerous sequels in its wake. That said, despite the flaws just mentioned I enjoyed this movie and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",Uriah43,"Jan 2, 2017"

1,Worst movie ever made? Pure MST3K fodder.,"I knew going in to this movie that it would suck.  Man was I wrong...  It was so bad that it rocked!  I rarely have this much fun with other hollywood crap.From one of the first race scenes where some Pizza guy shows up, to the last cheesy, incredibly lame line, this movie really shines.  If you like to heckle movies, this is it.  The king.  Better than the worst movie to ever come out of Canada.The acting sucked, the plot sucked, and best of all, the dialogue was straight out of a Wisconsin cheese factory.  And the emotional moments? Absolute hilarity!!I found it amusing that other commenters have compared this movie to point break.  It does have amazing similarity, yet it is so much more funny!  I always thought Keanu Reeves was the greatest, but I was wrong.I gave it a 1 for the simple fact that IMDB has it rated at 7.0 right now!!! We must offset the incorrect ratings!!!

9,Tons better than I'd heard-- An entertaining thrill ride!,"This was a pretty good movie. I'm not a car freak, but I do appreciate fine machinery. That's not enough for a movie I'd go see, however, so i was hesitant to watch ""The Fast and the Furious."" I did get the DVD, though, and am glad I did. Maybe my low expectations helped me to enjoy it-- I admit that I was pleasantly surprised. There are two heros-- the blond guy, and Vin Deisel. The blond guy was an annoying weasel and wuss for the first three fourths of the flick, and then I began to like him. The other hero is played by Deisel, an amazing actor. I'd seen him in ""Saving private Ryan,"" but nothing else. This dood' screen presence is magnetic. He's got charisma as well as depth. My guess is we'll see Deisel become a solid and major star--- that is, if he chooses his roles and career moves rightly.",bopdog,"Mar 3, 2002"
7,"Entertaining Action Movie,But Not The Best","This is the one that started it all,is it more than just Point Break with cars?Let's find out.First,the good,the action,the race scenes are great,but there is also some good fist fights.The climax,it was intense and had some great stunts.The soundtrack,while it dates the film a bit,there's no denying it fits the tone perfectly.This may sound a bit stupid,but the editing was great,it had a fast pace that worked terrifically.I liked that there seemed to be little CGI involved,it seemed like there was a lot of practical stunts.The story,while it may not be the best it is well told.The best part,which sets this film apart from Point Break,is the characters,they feel real and are likable,even if most of them are criminals,the acting was good,even if some dialogue wasn't the best.Now,the bad,the pacing,while a movie like this doesn't need to be long,I feel like it went by a bit too fast.The ending,it was kind of dumb,but I did like how it completed Paul Walker's arc of the film.The villain,while he did have one good scene,he wasn't memorable at all.The script,due to the writing,the story's a bit hard to follow.Overall,The Fast and The Furious is a fun movie with great characters,but some bad scripting.",jordansepticeye,"Apr 17, 2017"

I'm sorry but when the writer of this film wrote the script he had to have been half a sleep or thrown it together in two minutes because I could have wrote some thing better in my sleep.

7,Rehash Of Point Break With Street Racers Instead Of Surfers,"I had never actually seen this movie. I had seen most of the second one (I found it OK) watched the third one (was bored to tears) and I lost interest in the franchise before I was dragged to see the 6th movie, which despite not knowing a lot of character development, I enjoyed.However prior to the 7th movie being released, SkyMovies are showing all the movies, so I decided to see what I had missed out on!! Plot In A Paragraph: LA street racer Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) falls under the suspicion of the LAPD for a string of high-speed electronics truck robberies. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) an officer of the LAPD, joins the ranks of Toretto's highly skilled racing crew undercover to convict Toretto. However, O'Connor finds himself both enamored with this new world and in love with Toretto's sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster) As a rival racing crew gains strength, O'Connor must decide where his loyalties really lie.Although essentially ""Point Break"" with street racers instead of surfers, this is easily the best movie of the franchise (of the movies I have seen) not surprising with it being the first (they usually the best) As with ""Point Break"" the villain (Patrick Swayze in ""Point Break"") is much more interesting than the hero. Vin Diesel has charisma in spades, Paul Walker is likable and an attractive enough lead, Michelle Rodriguez is tough and sexy whilst Jordana Brewster is absolutely gorgeous. The racing scenes and action set pieces are well directed, the dialogue is a bit weak and cliché at times but overall this is a lot of fun.",slightlymad22,"Feb 20, 2015"
7,Good car-movie,"The Fast and the Furious is a good movie about cars. The cars look superb, the females are good looking, the camera work is great and the story is quite good too. Definitely worth to watch if you like fast cars",Spinal83,"Mar 7, 2003"
10,The OG and the Best,"I'm never one to write reviews, but this film is one of my favorites for multiple reasons. The 2 main characters of Brian and Dom are just a match made in heaven with Paul Walker and Vin Diesel playing them respectively. Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez fit perfectly as the love interests and are some of the most badass women I've seen in car films. This film is a timeless classic because of the car chases, the chemistry of the actors, and the greatness of the action displayed with the cars. The directing was really well done for a movie of this scope mixing slow motion in some car sequences with the real time effects of the stunts that the cars are undertaking. The music fits the film well, and it maintains the tone of the film superbly.The original of the fast and furious saga definitely set the bar extremely high for the sequels and luckily some of the sequels have been able to reach and some exceed it.
Most of all this movie is special for me because it was influential in my childhood as it was the first PG-13 movie I ever saw as a child (I was 5) lol.
Just an awesome movie all around. Check it out if you've never seen it before.",TXJoe4-FL813,"Feb 20, 2019"
6,Not Great But Solid,"Fast and the Furious franchise is one of the best examples of vicarious entertainment in the movie industry. Anyone who likes action, nice cars, racing, women etc. will find enjoyment from this movie and this franchise in one way or another. This film is a basic popcorn flic. There is not deep plot or deep characters here. So people looking for those elements in this film will be disappointed. However, most people probably knew not to expect such elements from a movie like this anyway, from the title to the trailers. I knew what I was getting when I watched this. So I enjoyed this film alright.The story isn't the most original. It's essentially Point Break, but admittedly done better, in my opinion. The characters are not great, though the characters are not what people are looking for in this movie anyway. The film stars Brian O'Conner, played by Paul Walker (RIP), who is an FBI agent. Paul Walker does fine overall in the film. His character I rooted for. However, I do not by for one second that this guy is an FBI agent. Nothing about his character makes be believe he would qualify for the FBI. When he tries to sound professional, it's not believable.Vin Diesel does good in the film as well. I am a fan of Vin Diesel as an actor. He is one of my favorite aspects of the film. Michelle Rodriguez is also in the film, but does not have that much to do. The side cast is fine. I did not really care for them, but I never found them annoying.The action and racing is the highlight of the film and it's done well. The races are fun, and the action (mainly car chases) will have you at the edge of your seat.Overall, I enjoyed the film. It's not a deep movie, but it's not supposed to be. It's a popcorn flick meant to appeal to guys, and especially teenage guys. That's why I call it vicarious entertainment. Every guy secretly dreams about being an action hero, driving a nice car, getting all the women. So many guys secretly would envision themselves as Paul Walker or Vin Diesel's character, or one of the other character in the film. That's why I say this is vicarious entertainment.",mitchell5954,"Aug 17, 2019"
8,Stylish,"Nothing wrong here. Rob Cohen's hyperdriven paean to illegal street racing is one of the more stylish films in recent memory and he gets some pretty good little performances from his actors, especially star-in-ascent Vin Diesel. Cohen is working as his title suggests but he also adds a bold use of color, flashy but not ostentatious editing and a sophisticated hip-hop soundtrack as a perfect compliment. As plots go, it's standard fifties fare, cribbing elements of `Rebel Without A Cause', but with everyone involved trying to create a technically superior experience, who cares?",bix171,"Mar 20, 2002"
6,made for the petrol head generation,"Now that part 6 is out there and still getting very positive reviews I found it time to pick up the series. I'm not normally into all that macho stuff but because it's involving cars I must had a closer look to the success of the series.Once over I thought to myself, why is this a hype. It surely isn't going to win any prices and Vin Diesel (Dominic Toretto)isn't the kind of actor that gives great performances (well maybe in the Riddick franchise). But then again I was surprised to see some well known faces from the genre I like, horror sci-fi and exploitation, and see Michelle Rodriguez (Letty) was here doing what she does best, playing the hard girl. Even Jordana Brewster (Mia Torreto) who started off in a horror called The Faculty (1998). This flick had so many technical aspects that people who are tuning their cars will get a tuned hard-on from watching this flick. But for me, I wasn't really attracted towards the story. Paul Walker (Brian O'Connor) did well and in fact it's all about him. But that is only clear in part 2. To be honest, it's a no-brainer with some action here and there but also with to many clichés like the cop falling for the sister of the bad one, and having the Stockholm Syndrome towards the end.

1,Worst than Worst,"I saw this movie because my brother recommended it. Big mistake. If you like cinema and movies (any kind) don't waste your time. It's just a show off of modified cars and a plot as shallow as the piece of paper it's written on. If you like cars, chases, and scantly clad women (which don't make a good movie at all), then this is for you. Shallow acting. Silly lines. Loud soundtrack. Lousy camera movements. Plastic characters. Flat performances. Amazingly predictable story line. Empty script... Finally I felt myself pushed into adding this line just to fill the minimum. There is really very little that can be added to this movie. And it's quite difficult to find word that define the rage any serious movie-lover feels at seeing this junk being released. As if one sin wasn't enough, they actually made two sequels. This proofs that the minds of the studio bosses and the minds of the teenagers (which are the only ones that can enjoy such a trash) are one and the same. Really the movie does not deserve more. 1/10",er-guille,"Jan 3, 2007"
9,Testosterone packed,"I've read alot of negative comments about this movie and that really annoys me.  If you don't like cars, and if you don't like action, then why would you even watch this movie in the first place? The whole point of this movie is to give the public a look inside import racing, and spice it up with a whole lotta action and sex. Don't bash the movie if its not the type of movie you like, just be smart and read the description before you watch it.",Strobe32,"Mar 3, 2003"
7,"Weak story, but heart stopping action","This film examines the street racing subculture and provides ample thrills for the 25 and under set.  Based on the box office numbers this film threw up, every teenager in the U.S. must have seen it at least twice, since it doesn't have much appeal outside that demographic.The screenplay pretends to be a detective story about an undercover cop Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) who infiltrates the street racing scene to try to find a group thieves that has been hijacking tractor trailers and stealing the cargo.  Make no mistake about it.  This is not a detective story.  This is a racing story replete with fast, NOS guzzling street machines, horsed up to burn rubber and detailed to attract babes.  Fasten your seatbelt for a screaming ride to testosterone city.The script panders shamelessly to post pubescent boys with hormone overload. Universal wisely kept it PG-13 to maximize the film's target audience. There is plenty of strutting, getting in people's faces, muscle flexing and a street fight about every fifteen minutes.  Everyone demands respect and if they don't get it there is either a brawl or a race.  Director Rob Cohen, who cut his directorial teeth on `Miami Vice', has an implicit understanding of what makes male movies work and he pulls out all the stops in this film.
Unfortunately, Cohen gets so immersed in the street culture that he recklessly reinforces antisocial conduct as normative.  The film sends a consistent message that honor and loyalty to one's friends are more important than the obeying the law.  The police are portrayed as jerks and fools.  The only way to handle injustice is to take matters into your own hands.  You stick up for your friends even if they are criminals and you are a cop.  If another cop disrespects one of your undercover friends, you slug him.  While this might be an accurate reflection of the culture, I feel compelled to interject that the movie industry has a social responsibility to teach our youth good lessons rather than bolster countercultural behavior in the name of realism.Once you get past the script, the film gets extraordinarily high technical marks for the action photography and stunts.  The cars are first rate. Most of the ones seen at the race wars were owned by actual street racers who brought their cars from everywhere to be in the film.  The film has so much adrenaline pumping action that by the time it is finished you need oxygen and a yoga session to settle yourself down.  I can't ever remember a film that had so many cars going airborne.  There is more molten, smoking rubber in this film than in a Perelli manufacturing plant.  The final stunt where the cars are racing to beat the train across the railroad crossing is an awesome, heart-stopping thrill ride.  It is easy to see why kids flocked to this film.The most notable member of the cast is Paul Walker (The Skulls, Pleasantville) who steps up to the lead for the first time.  In the featurette included with the DVD, Rob Cohen declares Walker a modern day Steve McQueen.  I'm afraid not.  McQueen, who saw his heyday in the 1950's and 60's, was a swaggering, audacious male lead brimming with machismo and frequently compared to Paul Newman (who was the star in `Somebody Up There Likes Me', the first film in which McQueen appeared).  Walker is a pussycat by comparison.  If Walker were to be compared to anyone of that generation it would be Troy Donohue, the good looking heart throb of the 1960's. Donohue wasn't extremely dynamic, but the camera loved him, and so did the teenage girls.  Walker fits comfortably into that description.If there is one standout in the film it is Vin Diesel as Dominic.  Diesel carries every scene in which he appears with a pure and imposing power that is present whether he is scrapping or just standing there.  He is mostly tough, but in the scene where he tells Brian about his father, he shows that he can conjure up a vulnerable side.  He presents his character in a way that is both charismatic and complex, part villain and part hero.  No one else in this cast is anywhere near Diesel's league as an actor.Jordana Brewster shows some promise as Dominic's sister and Brian's love interest.  Rick Yune, whose performance I enjoyed in `Snow Falling on Cedars', is menacing and believable as the leader of the Asian gang.This film has a limited audience, but is well done for its target market. I rated it a 7/10 on the strength of the action and stunts.  The story is about a 2/10, but the racing and chase scenes are as good as it gets.",FlickJunkie-2,"Jan 4, 2002"

They weren't the best actors in the world, but do you expect every movie to have academy award winners in it? Movies are for entertainment not critisism. If you dont like the actors or the plot dont watch the movie! I thought this movie was good, and Vin Diesel is a very sexy talented man.",barbie_babe1998,"May 17, 2002"
7,Great action and illogic make this a good B movie,"The Fast and the Furious star the always good Vin Diesel as a car racer- on the streets.  He meets Brian (Paul Walker) in a good stoke of luck as he saves him from the cops.  Then some more plot comes in into the film, but it the action that counts here.Giving credit where credit is due, the film has outstanding action sequences involving car chases that haven't been this exhilarating since the infamous pod race in Phantom Menace.  Plus (and surprisingly), the film envelops you into the story, and it makes you feel some actual feeling for the characters among the blaze of the cars.  And for that I reccomend this movie for the thrill seeking audience that has chomped up the recent popcorn flicks such as Mummy 2, Tomb Raider and Swordfish (Fast and Furious is one of the best ones of it's kind so far this year).However, with most B flicks come the inevitable flaws, and this has 2 usual yet still dumb ones.  1, from the looks at some of the steamy and violent scenes in the movie, it looks like as if director Cohen was making a rated R movie filled with even more action, sexual content and dare I say naughty language in the mix.  Yet, once again, it might seem, the guys up top have made this film into yet another PG-13 flick to try and up the sales.  That's why say what you will about the South Park movie, but at least they kept on trying at it until they got the R (and that is also evident from the s**t episode from 2 days ago) unlike such movies as Bring It On and Coyote Ugly.And 2 (illogical part), this film takes place in Los Angeles, a city that is sometimes called the city on wheels.  Then how come when the race in the streets scenes come up, you almost see no cars whatsoever on the streets (unless it's used for the plot or something)?  I have a feeling that even though this doesn't have much logic in it, at least it's better here than in New York, cause then it would be just plain ludicrous.  Anyway, like I said, It's a good action movie, though not a great one.  Kudos go to the director, stunt co-ordinators, drivers and Diesel.  B+",Quinoa1984,"Jun 22, 2001"
7,"It coming at you, FAST AND FURIOUS.","Action movies consists on three things, fast cars, good chases and good actors and characters. In The Fast and the Furious, that is acceptable for a action movie. Vin Diesel stars as a street racer, who's friends dominated the streets with tricked out cars and exciting races on the streets of L.A. Paul Walker plays a cop, tracking Diesel. Together, they form a duo. They so discover that the street racing is causing theft to occur in L.A. So, it's up for Walker's character to tracked own these robbers before they hit again. The Fast and the Furious is a good action flick for the summer because it combined the energy level to high as the chases become greater and greater. As for Walker and Diesel, these guys know how to act. They know what's the game is. When the game is on, they go at it. Their formula together is very good and the action sequences are really astonishing. As for the car chases, they are somehow very neat and well made. All in all, The Fast and the Furious is a heart pounding, fast and furious ride from start to finish. ★★★ 3 stars.",blazesnakes9,"May 7, 2011"
8,Speed Rush,"Rob Cohen's ""Fast and Furious"" is just that: an adrenaline and speed rush, very derivative, not original, though effective overall. Cohen accomplishes this with the given material, by using intensity, pacing, hard driving music, and casting high power, young actors in the movie, in particular Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, and Rick Yune. F&F is the kind of movie that may not be memorable for it's dramatic content and narrative style, rather as a breakthrough vehicle for its stars. On that basis, the movie has merit. Director Cohen definitely performs some of the most amazing car sequences on screen. The driving stunts rule.Brian (Walker) is an undercover cop investigating a ring of high speed car thieves. While undercover Brian befriends Dom Toretto (Diesel), a powerful street racer with a dark past, who has a sense of honor and loyalty. Dom's rival is a cold blooded leader of an Asian gang, Johnny Tran (Yune). All movie leads shine. Vin Diesel has a commanding physical screen presence. He powers Dom's character with an edge and sense of danger. Diesel will be a huge action star-- he's got the physique and is a good actor. Walker has the leading man good-looks, and attitude. He is well matched as Diesel's foil. He does well with the trite undercover cop storyline of falling in love with the suspect's (Dom's) sister. Rick Yune gives Johnny Tran a dangerous air-- a man of few words and an icy killer. It's always encouraging when a movie has both strong and charismatic heroes and villains. It is all about being cool and looking good-- and ""Fast and Furious"" does this with style and without significance. That is a good thing...",jon.h.ochiai,"Jun 25, 2001"
6,"What I have learned from this movie: Vin Diesel, even shirtless","does not a movie make. Oh, it had it's moments. There was certainly talent in this movie. And one of the bestest exploding cars ever. And Diesel has a certain . . . charisma, even when I don't quite get the game. But I just didn't get it. Admittedly, I'm not a fan of the genre. Maybe if I was, it would have seemed more coherent, instead of a of ""day in the life"" mojo. There were too many characters, too many wandering subplots, too many moments where I was going ""huh?"" And then not really caring. I did like that the two major female characters weren't ditzes or helpless. The girlfriend even throws one of the best punches in the film, even though her apparent age did get close to my squick line. But good grief, you've got Vin Diesel, and the only real fight scene he's in, he's hitting someone who's already down? Maybe it's 'cause I know him through Pitch Black/ Chronicles of Riddick, but I want superhero (okay, super anti-hero) stuff. I want him in real fights. I want preternatural. The movie might have been better if it had been more violent, more sexual. Or it might have been better if it had had a tighter plot. Or it might have been better with more things blowing up. Mmm, explosions. As it was, it was fine. But I don't think I'll be watching it again.",magratk,"Mar 5, 2006"
10,Nostalgic,"I give this movie a 10 out of 10 not because it's perfect, because it isn't, to me this movie is a 10 simply because it is a movie that I can enjoy and rewatch several times without feeling bored.

Also, I feel like the series kinda went off the track in later movies but in this one, it really is just about cars and cool stuff.Rest in peace Paul Walker.

6,"Fun, but tried too hard","There's one thing that's always bugged me about this movie: that it's not what everyone who hasn't seen it thinks it is. For whatever reason, there had to be a tacked-on crime story, the whole subplot with Johnny Tran (he should've had a separate movie, and it's a shame that the amazing motorcycle stuntwork is now completely forgotten), and lots of interesting but generally uncohesive exposition about Dominic Toretto. In fact, you could compare this movie to a ""ricer"", with lots of bits that look cool but don't add anything.If you want action, you got it. The racing is always exciting (well, as exciting as going in a straight line can be), the trailer hijackings need to be seen to be believed, and of course, I loved the motorcycle chase at the end. But I wanted a movie about street racing. STREET RACING, not cops or crime families or vendettas or divided loyalties or love triangles or any of that meaningless junk. A good screenwriter could make a movie about racing work. As it is, we're left with a fairly generic action movie that's a notch above average.",dkw001,"Mar 6, 2006"

6,Fast Cars and Furious Action!,"The Fast and the FuriousStarring: Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana BrewsterGenre: Action/Crime/DramaRated: PG-13This movie was really cool! I liked all the action, thrills and I liked the car chasing scenes in this action packed adventure. The movie is about a guy named Brian (Paul Walker) who is a detective who is undercover and blinding in with street racer groups to catch the bad guys. So while he is on the case he joins up with Dominic (Vin Diesel) who is one the best street racers and together they bring the bad guys down! The best chasing scene is the one where after they are street racing Dominic gets chased by the cops and ditches them. I really thought the car the Vin Diesel drove was really cool. The one he drives at the end of the movie kind of look liked the car he drove in the movie XXX. But it was a big shame that Vin Diesel wasn't in the sequel but he wasn't able to be in the sequel due to the fact that he was busy with a different movie at the time when 2 Fast 2 Furious was in either pre-production or post-production. But at least Paul Walker returned for the sequel. This would be a movie I would recommend to car racing fans.",SonicStuart,"Jan 14, 2004"
1,This movie was terrible!,"This film has all the factors in place to create a cinematic nightmare. The `plot' was paper-thin; a four-year could determine the outcome within three minutes. The acting, writing, and cinematography were of the lowest caliber. Movies like this, those that are god-awful, but rake in tons of cash, are a cry for help from this generation. They are uneducated, and will swallow, hook line, and sinker whatever the studios throw at them.Watching a bunch of insecure males, trying to compensate for there lack of natural equipment, along with women who are either whores, or searching for male validation because daddy did not hold them enough as child, is no fun.

No rating,Fast Cars + Fast Women + Hot Music = Hit Summer Movie,"""The Fast and the Furious"" follows the time-honoured and time-worn formula in order to produce a film feature that will be swallowed whole by the 18-25 year-old set.  The director, Rob Cohen (Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story) did not intend to bring to the screen his vision of a moral tale.  There is no deep thought required to digest this morsel of celluloid.  It can be compared to a 15-second amusement park ride that thrills the audience for the time occupied, but leaves them empty after the ride is over.  In short, this is a good summer movie that will never see the light of the prestigious film awards.The plot involves an undercover police officer who must insert himself into a street-racing ""team"" in order to shut down the truck hijacking that is frequently happening on the Los Angeles freeway system.The cars are the products of youth that are totally enamoured with the automobile, from supped-up Honda Civics to Toyota Supras enhanced with nitrous oxide.  These vehicles are a young man's dream.The women of the story are Michelle Rodriguez (Girl Fight) and Jordana Brewster (The Faculty).  These two ""girls"" portray the sweet, young, exotic playmates of the male leads in the movie.  There is no time to develop their characters and their presence in the movie is generally wasted.  The male leads are Vin Diesel (Pitch Black) and pretty boy, Paul Walker (The Skulls and Varsity Blues).  Diesel, he of the mysterious ethnic origin shows promise as an up-and-coming thespian.  However, Walker provides a performance that can easily be forgotten or be replaced.
Finally, the music is the best part of the movie.  It is a superb sampling of the latest popular music, with DMX to Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit.  This creative aspect is the most solid part of ""The Fast and the Furious"".  It moves the scenes along in the movie and transforms it into one long music video.In conclusion, ""The Fast and the Furious"" has been churned out by Harvard graduate, Rob Cohen as a very watchable action movie.  He is developing a good reputation as a competent director of the action genre of films.  My suggestion, see the movie in the theatres, but buy the movie soundtrack instead of the VCR/DVD when it is released in a few months.",SPYMAN2001,"Jul 28, 2001"
6,What it lacks in substance it makes for in style,"The Fast and the Furious is one of those movies that everybody watches and majority of people like , although it predominately appeals to the brainless boy racer a!shole genre there is no denying th almost street racing craze it has a hand in playing. The plot is not the the brainiest so don't go expecting a grossing movie and the acting is a little drape and the script is quite crap to be honest . But then at the end of the day it is a movie that you would check out for the action as there are some very well made car races and sequences put together. Personally I would not look into it saying it is the best car movie made as there have been better ones out there like Gone in 60 secs but it is worth a rent , I mean if you get fast , cars women and action and semi good acting from Diesel , Brewster and Rodrgieuz.THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS : 6.7 OUT OF 10",shadowman123,"Oct 20, 2008"
6,A movie for car fans and not only...,"""The Fast and the Furious"" is the first movie of the rest that it followed and I think that with the second one were the only movies which did not have so many visual effects.In this movie we watch an undercover police officer (Paul Walker who plays as Brian O'Conner) who gets involved with street racing and becomes very popular from that. Vin Diesel makes a really good interpretation as Dominic Toretto who plays as a street racer. Also good interpretations made in this movie by Jordana Brewster (Mia Toretto) who plays as Dominic Toretto's sister and Michelle Rodriguez (Letty) who plays as the girlfriend of Dominic Toretto.I liked very much ""The Fast and the Furious"" movie because it shows us how is to be in this world of super cars, races, speed and all of that stuff, and makes you also feel all of these one by one.",Thanos_Alfie,"Nov 8, 2013"

6,Fast And The Furious Decent But With Flaws,"The Fast and the Furious is decent but with flaws from director Rob Cohen whose admirable in making this movie about an undercover cop who infiltrates an underground subculture of street racers in Los Angeles. The cast for the most part are good in their roles including Paul Walker, Vin Disiel, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Rick Yune, and Ted Levine but some of them (Yune and Levine to name a few) lack screen time. Ja Rule even makes a brief extended appearance but his character like others aren't in it that much to leave an impression. The racing sequences are intense but there's some you can tell is obviously CG which is okay because thats the only way they could ever show the characters going so fast in the movie. The action sequences are well executed but some of them can over the top at times. The dialogue wasn't the greatest at times either and there were some predictable things that happened. For those of you who have seen it you might know I'm talking about. If you're a fan of these type of films than you might like this one better than I did. Despite it's flaws though overall The Fast And The Furious isn't that bad it does have intense action/race sequences, some suspense, and good performances by the cast but the movie as a whole could have been better.",tburke85,"Jun 21, 2009"

10,The Ultimate Summer Movie,"I just back from seeing The Fast and the Furious and i have to say i have never been so pumped after seeing a film. Keep in mind from the moment i saw the trailer for this film i wanted desperately to see it. It had fast cars, Fast girls, and it guaranteed some pretty cool action sequences. Needless to say that i wasn't disappointed and this has made my list of best movie of the summer so far.The plot in this film is pretty basic. A undercover cop named Brian(Paul Walker) is sent to get the inside scoop on a group of street racers who may or may not be smuggling equipment from pick-up trucks. The street racing team is lead by Dom(Vin Diesel). Brian however begins to fall for Dom's sister Mia(Jordana Brewster) and things begin to become truly complicated.Why is this the ultimate summer movie? You can go into this film with no expectations and be truly entertained. It's mindless fun so to speak and it's a good way to spend 90 minutes. I enjoyed every minute of this film and as the title promises there is a lot of Furious action.The racing sequences are done really well and are the best i've seen in a long while. There are some good camera shots and camera angles and these shots make the races even more exhilarating. The best sequence has to be towards to end that involves cars and one big pick-up truck.The acting is also pretty good. Vin Diesel is going to be huge. He is a very commanding performer and he alone carries this film acting wise. The same can not be said for Paul Walker who is very flat. I said this before in my review of the skulls the guy needs some lessons stat. The girls are really good in the film. Jordana brewster displays the sensitvity and sensuality that is needed to portray her character and Michelle Rodriguez as dom's girlfriend letty is just one big ball of sass. i loved this character and i wish she could've been in the film more.All in all a good summer movie. i'm sure you won't be disappointed.",MissCzarChasm,"Jun 23, 2001"

It's not a movie masterpiece, it's full of cliches (buddy cop / heist movie / bromance driven flick), the CGI is silly, the characters are pretty one-dimensional, and the story lacks cohesiveness. Also, acting is all over the place, but this is Vin Diesel we are talking about, not the likes of Pacino, DeNiro or Hoffman.Yet, it's a fun movie to watch, that delivers great amounts of action sprinkled with some humor.In many Ways, this movie is exactly what i thought it would be, and that's a good thing.

7,Not a movie you have to think about,"In an earlier review when the film came out, I commented on how awesome the movie was. But really, it's not.

This movie really made Vin Diesel HUGE among teenage audiences, but it wasn't the film that made me like Diesel. If you want to see Diesel actually.... acting, try the movie BOILER ROOM. This film doesn't have much of a plot, not a lot of acting, but it's fun to watch for the cars. So those are my comments after viewing it several more times...SCORE: 6 out of 10 (okay)",Justin Harris,"Dec 28, 2002"
10,Hott Cars And Hott Guyz,"I really think "" The Fast and the Furious "" was a good movie . When I saw the comercials I didn't really think it would be a good movie .

6,May not be quite what you were expecting!,"This review is intended for people who haven't seen the movie and are considering buying the DVD.The best advice I can offer is simply this:  If you haven't seen the movie yet and are considering buying the DVD, DON'T.  Not until you rent it first.I won't go off and say that this movie is either bad or great.  Everyone needs to decide that for themselves.  However, as a word of caution, it may not be what you expected.  Here's what I found.Before renting the DVD last weekend, I had considered buying it for 2 reasons:1)  Vin Diesel is one of the best new actors and I liked him in his previous films.2)   I am a former high school drag racer and still love fast cars.Based on the previews and the promos for the movie, I had thought that Vin played the main character.  I was wrong.  Unfortunately, Paul Walker gets substantially more screen time and the movie is really about his character, not Vin's.  One thing I think everyone can agree on:  Paul Walker is no Vin Diesel!!!! Additionally, there really isn't as much action as you would think.  As some other reviewers have mentioned, there is a substantial amount of screen time spent with the actors standing around the cars and talking smack.  There's also an unconvincing love story (which eats up the minutes) between Paul Walker's character and the sister of Vin's character.As a result, I'm glad I didn't blow the $20 to buy it.  One viewing was plenty for me.  However, it wasn't a waste of time either.Overall, I gave the movie 6 out of 10 stars.  It wasn't nearly as good as I was expecting, but it also wasn't trash.  Sure, it's a familiar story that's been done several times before, and better, but in general I try not to let previous versions of a story influence me.  I try to let each movie stand on its own merits.I hope you find this helpful.",JJ-152,"Jan 9, 2002"
10,This is the best movie that I have EVER seen!!!,"I HATE people that badmouth movies with STUPID criticisms, and seeing as I can only find bad criticisms on the internet, I'm here to sway the pendgulem. The acting was impeccable! Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are two actors, not soon to be forgotten, and with the sequel coming out in 2003, who COULD forget them?! They are obviously the hottest onscreen duo that I have seen in a long time! Many memorable lines will forever be etched into he minds of viewers such as: ""You break her heart, I'll break your neck"" (Vin Diesel); ""...it doesn't matter if you win by an inch or a mile- winning is winning."" (also Vin Diesel). This movie is by far a definite winner and everyone that I have talked to that doesn't like it... haven't even seen i. They say the commercials for it don't look good! Well I say don't judge a book by its cover and don't judge a movie by it's trailor!",bsblover99_98,"May 20, 2002"
6,cars and nostalgia feels,"The Fast and the Furious (2001) is pretty good movie for someone who love cars, especially street race.

1,AVOID AVOID AVOID. WORST MOVIE EVER CREATED!!!!!!!!!,"terrible acting, a pathetic plot, stereotypical characters and a predictable soundtrack filled with moronic rap songs. How anyone can enjoy this film is beyond my belief. I don't care if it does have cool cars. The cars should have nothing to do with how good a movie is. Any idiot can slap together a movie with cool cars in it. Fast and Furious is a prime example. If the move had a better plot, WAY BETTER ACTING (the key downfall to the film), and a different cast then it might have been watchable. MOVIES LIKE THIS SIGNAL THE DEATH OF FILM!!! Don't even rent. It's better to keep the 1 hour and 40 mins of your life rather than waste it away on this piece of trash.0/10",TheyKilledTheGiggler,"Apr 19, 2002"
8,"It is a neat, nitrous oxide powered glamour film","The surprisingly humble beginnings (by comparison) of what is now a six film series, The Fast and the Furious was a hit for bringing a new lease of life to the racing film.An undercover cop, Brian O'Conner, must discover who is to blame for goods trucks being hi-jacked and stolen by drivers in high performance street cars. He puts himself into the urban culture of street racing where he meets Dominic Toretto and his team. Brian falls for Dominic's sister, Mia, in the process and threatens his investigation and his life.The film is quite a brainless piece of entertainment, its story is predictable, it follows an undercover cop who starts to sympathize with his targets, and the characters are written spontaneously to fit the demands of the plot. You gotta love the opening dialogue: ""I like the tuna here,"" ""Nobody likes the tuna here!"" Plus, Paul Walker really is a bland actor.But, that isn't why we watch the film. The Fast and the Furious does have some great car racing scenes and director Rob Cohen can shoot the cars and make them look great. What is most appealing is the physicality of the stunts and the racing; there's no CGI tomfoolery here, and there is a simplicity about the film that makes it worth watching. You don't need to suspend your disbelief, the plot doesn't shovel many excuses for racing into your face.It is a neat, nitrous oxide powered glamour film. It doesn't say much, and it will probably age badly over time (and get a remake) but it is a must for every petrol-head and car racing fan out there.",CinemaCocoa,"Apr 13, 2017"

1,QUITE POSSIBLY THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!!!!!!!,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The idea of street racing is cool, because I personally do it and I love it, but this movie totally blew it's potential.  Not only that, it's a huge rip off of ""Point Break.""  An undercover cop, trying to get the inside on these street racers who are suspected to be robbing 18-wheelers, while falling in love with the girl who is on the side of the street racers.  That rite there is a horrible plot and should've been tossed at the site of that garbage.  There were also many other things wrong with the film. First, you see the driver's using nitrous on their rice burning cars like 4 or 5 times in a single race.  That is almost not even possible because the Japanese cars they are using can't take that kind of pressure on the engine block.  They could last about 2 shots of nitrous, maybe 3, before their engine block blew up and/or cracked, or before you had to do a complete rebuild of the engine, both top-end and bottom-end construction.Secondly, when they race at the beginning, they do a mile long race, which no idiot would do because to determine the winner, all you really need to race is a quarter of a mile. And lastly, the movie would have been a tremondous amount better if they used AMERICAN CARS!!!!!!  All these ""new age"" racers nowadays try to supe up their Honda Civics and their Eclipse's, and none of them were designed to race and none of them could ever compete with the kind of power an AMERICAN CAR could put out.The only two cars in the film that are worth any respect are the Ford Lightning, that doesnt even see the drag strip, which is stupid considering that it does a 10 second quarter-mile which is damn good, and the Dodge Challenger, which THANK GOD is raced, cuz if it wasnt i would have killed myself, but sadly ends up being destroyed by that idiot Vin Diesel.  At that point, i was getting ready to cry, and then shoot myself, but luckily the movie ended.",Wipitvigils,"Mar 29, 2002"
No rating,"Not an Oscar winner, but good fun nevertheless!","I was primed by two people who had already been to see this film before I watched it. One told me it was ""Point Break"" with cars, the other said it was a boy racers dream. But after seeing the trailor I had to go.
Yes, no supirse, it was Point Break with cars. And yes the story line left a little to be desired. And yes the acting isn't genius. However, despite what others might say, unless you happen to be the most anal film critic in the world or hate cars, you will enjoy this film. It's good fun. To me it sits in the same class as films such as ""Gone in 60 seconds"", ""Days of Thunder"" et al. The story isn't the most important aspect. It's a thrill ride, an experience where the atmosphere and lifestyle captured in the movie is the important thing. This is achieved by the overall look of the film. The storyline drops to a third place behind the cars and the look of the thing.I went away with a feelgood factor wanting to get into a Nissan Skyline and go for a drive!Like I said, no Shakespeare here, but good fun.",jdashberry,"Feb 7, 2002"
6,"Great Cars, Cool Stunts, Bad Movie","I attended an advance screening of ""The Fast and the Furious"" with high anticipation. Here, I thought, is my cool sexy action movie for the summer. I was looking for pure entertainment with just a thread of credibilty. What I got was a lopsided movie with great cars, amazing stunts, crappy acting, and bad editing. If one-fourth of the attention given to the cars had been paid to the acting and the human film story, the movie would have been just fine. Unfortunately, this was not the case.First of all, this movie really reminded me of Point Break with Keanu Reeves, only instead of surfing, street racing is the centerpiece.Both stories are completely improbable. Both stories involve green cops sent to infiltrate gangs of thieves who use the loot to fund their expensive hobbies. In both films, the hero jeopardizes his case by gaining a dangerous level of respect for the charismatic leader of the band of thieves.  The big difference between the two films is that while Point Break works, The Fast and the Furious does not. The failing point of this film is the lead actor. Paul Walker is the sucking-chest wound of this movie. Yeah, he's pretty, but he completely unable to emote or communicate anything about his character. Even in the presence of excellent actors like Vin Diesel and Ted Levine, he is like a plank of wood. Jordana Brewster isn't too pro either. All the other actors(including Michelle Rodriguez)do a fine job.
Had the basic criteria been met(competent lead actor, clean editing), The Fast and the Furious could have been great. As is, it is moderately awful.",labebe,"Jun 23, 2001"
9,"Whether you're cringing in suspense, or watching with intensity, this movie will NOT let you leave unimpressed.","This movie has a combination of fast-paced action, nerve-tingling suspense, heart-throbbing drama, and side-cracking laughter.  The sound brings out the cars, which brings out the actors.  A true 'must-see' for any car enthusiast or racer.  This movie had me sitting on the edge of my seat during, and my jaw wide open after.  The action never stopped and the gears kept turning in my mind, guessing where the movie would go next.  I would pay the rising movie charges to see this one many more times.",lldecker,"Jun 25, 2001"
6,"Ten minutes of perfection, swallowed by an hour of pain.","What kind of movie is this?  Race Movie?  Good guy / Bad Guy movie?  Buddy Film?  The outline says it all.  It's two hundred other movies, all done better, even by Keenu Reeves in such 'classics' as Point Break. It's to be assumed that this flix was not attempting intellectual or spiritual growth from the audience only the hard 'fast' world of cars and pretty girls in a simple fuel injected plot.Trouble is, that it was a bit on the shallow side as far as hard racing and high end 'furious' motions. Though, the one and only street race scene with Brian O'Conner (LEAD: Paul Walker) does an excellent job of conveying speed and the slightly warped view of the world street racers bring to the race scene.  Rent it ONLY for this scene.I would say more about the car chases later in the film, but I don't want to spoil any plot info.  Let's just say that if this was the best hijacking game they could come up with...then they were doomed from the beginning...just like my attention.",alichino,"Apr 19, 2002"

10,This movie rocks,"You people!  This movie was the best of the summer.  Everyone is slamming it for not being artistic or something, but did you expect it to be?  I didn't.  I expected a major testosterone rush and I got it.FaF warranted three sittings in the theatre.  It had the best cinematography since Crouching Tiger and Fight Club, and it had good special effects.  If all anyone ever watched was a movie like Traffic that was an intellectual movie then he or she would not have a credible say about the quality of a movie.  If you can't handle bad acting and a mediocre plot in exchange for some intense testosterone pumping action then don't come near it.  What were you expecting?  It's VIN DIESEL!!!

7,If you have what it takes... You can have it ALL!,"Dominic Toretto is a gang leader who is accused of hijacking trucks and stealing over a million dollars worth of electronic equipment. The FBI sends LAPD officer Brian O'Conner undercover into Los Angeles' street racing circuit to take down Toretto and his team. As O'Conner becomes part of Toretto's life and gets involved with his sister, Mia, he tries to prove that Toretto is innocent.TFaTF can be seen as a mindless popcorn flick. However, what puts TFaTF above mindless popcorn flicks is the fact that it has a brain which took me back by surprise. The film isn't only about street racing with hot lesbian girls and how much muscle your car has. There's actually a decent story in here! And this is the reason why I enjoyed the film.Another thing that stuck out to me was the rare use of CGI. The car sequences in the film are extremely well done, mostly due to using practical effects rather than CGI. The scenes felt more real and gritty compared to action scenes in other films. The climax car sequence had me on the edge of my seats!The performances by the cast members aren't half bad either. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker both pull off convincing roles. There's something about Diesel that is likable. I don't know what it is, though. I also liked Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez, who complete the clan. Overall, here's a mindless popcorn film that isn't at all that mindless and performances that aren't at all bad.",moviewizguy,"Jun 14, 2010"

Try Little Giants or something. The Fast and the Furious is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and not just because I have a limited interest in cars.I really think someone decided to make a movie about cool cars. Then they realized halfway through making it that they needed a plot. What they came up with was the equivalent of a 5 year old scribbling on a napkin.Highest recommendation to avoid.

No rating,An Pulse Pounding Action Flick,"When I first saw this movie I was amazed at the acting, the special effects, and most of all, the cars. This movie gives us a real look inside the world of street racing. Rob Cohen really did his homework before he made this movie. But,underneath the awesome special effects, the great research and superb directing there is the glue that holds a movie together...the acting. I had only seen Vin Diesel in one movie before, that being Pitch Black. In that performance he wasn't great. But here his skills really show. This is the first time I have seen Paul Walker in a leading role and I have to say I am impressed. This is a great movie for action and car fans alike. ****1/2 out of *****",Tjedi34,"Oct 6, 2002"
6,Good start to a great action-packed film franchise,"I love FAST AND FURIOUS movies, so I thought, ""What if I reviewed these movies?"", so I will review each film from the original film to the new film.So, I begin my second franchise review with the original 2001 film, The Fast and the Furious.The Fast and the Furious was not only released on June 22, 2001 to financial success and mixed reviews, but it also launched the careers of nearly all of it's stars, including Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, who would later become household names, as well as Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez.The film is directed by Rob Cohen with a screenplay by David Ayer, who wrote the 2001 film Training Day and co-wrote this film with two other writers including the creator of the franchise, Gary Scott Thompson.The film follows undercover cop Brian O'Conner who must stop semi-truck hijackers led by criminal and wanted fugitive Dominic Toretto from stealing expensive electronic equipment while developing a relationship with Dominic's sister, Mia Toretto and forming a friendship with Dominic.That is just a quick summary. I won't go into too much of the plot, because a lot of people should know what is the main premise of the story in this film and the other Fast and Furious movies. The franchise would later go to move away from the underground street racing plot into a plot much more cooler with the heist of $100 million dollars, gun fights and brawls and the movie that would change this franchise and bring new life into it would be the fifth entry in the series, released in April of 2011, Fast Five.The story is just really cool and amazing, but is not Oscar worthy, but the dialogue is the movie can get a little weak on a few occasions, but not throughout the whole darn movie.The action is just top-notch and the car chases in this film is as intense and action-packed as they would be later on in the franchise. My favorite car chase is at the beginning of the film and at the end of the film involving Dominic and Brian driving.The acting is just dreadful, but not all of it is. I will give credit to Vin Diesel, who plays Dominic Toretto and he pulls it off wonderfully, but while it's not Oscar worthy, he does show emotion, drama and laughter into his character. Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz, is great in this film and she would remain in that part for the other films and she would play in James Cameron's groundbreaking special-effects extravaganza Avatar and in the 2002 action-horror / zombie movie film based on the survival video game, Resident Evil.The other two that also does a great job is definitely Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster, who plays Brian O'Conner and Mia Toretto, and they do a very decent good job with the material written for them and they have such a great chemistry on the screen.Dominic Toretto's team members are just good. The actors who play the people in his crew is just incredible, with the exception of Matt Schulze as Vince.The music and soundtrack is really cool and Ja Rule is in this film, playing the role of Edwin and he provides music on the soundtrack.Overall, The first and original FAST AND THE FURIOUS is really good, but can get a little confusing in a few areas. I give it a 6 out of 10. It's not the best score, but certainly not the worst. This film is worth the watch and worth buying on DVD and Blu-Ray or watching on basic cable and Video on Demand or Xfinity Streampix.",joshuadrake-91275,"Sep 23, 2015"

Take it as a pure adrenaline rush though and it's great.  This brought back memories of the original Gone in 60 Seconds from way back in the 70's.

10,Tremendous piece of escapism.,Thoroughly enjoyable yarn which has all the action you could want in a modern tale of woe. Vin Diesel is perfect for the role of Toretto and I'm sure we'll see loads more of that bad boy. Slight complaint is with Region 2 DVD - the menu sucks - difficult to find the deleted scenes and music videos - but after listening to the awful rapping on the Pov City Anthem (if that is indeed what it is called) meant I didn't miss too much.,deid69,"Feb 21, 2002"
6,SERVED ITS PURPOSE VERY WELL,"This Film was exactly what I expected. Highly entertaining for the first two views. Fab effects, georgeous cars (nice to see some Europeans). The only drawback was that I couldn't see the bodywork for the 'body work'! Never mind girls... the split second of Vin w/out a t-shirt was worth the money. My other half wants it on DVD.

I did not even bother to watch it to the (certainly highly dramatic) finale because I got bored s###less. Not much else to say, but whoever participated in that movie (in whatever position - from director to the last extra - except of course for Vin, who shines out in this like a shaft of gold when all around is dark) should under no circumstances quit their day jobs. Laughable plot, incredibly bad acting... well, maybe, just maybe it has got all the right stuff for a c-movie classic. By the way, I am in no way a Vin Diesel fan, it is just the even worse acting of everybody else that makes him shine that much in this piece of ""movie"".",kraemerdenis,"Aug 2, 2005"

1,An action film with no action,"Well, I suppose the best way to review a film is compare it to your expectations. What I expected was a wafer thin plot, even less acting, and lots of fast, insane and fun car chases to fill up my afternoon and forget about the next morning.What I got of cause was, a wafer thin plot, even less acting...and no fast insane and fun car chases. The cars were supposed to be the big thing in the film. But all they do is spend a fortune on building up the car and then drag race it down a road. No turns, leaps, death-defying dives between city traffic, and no tense racing. Just hit the metal, and whoever spent the most money and had the most nitro wins.And the story made even less sense (what the hell is with that fight at the start?), the script seems to have never been through a redraft, and most of the actors were permanently comatose. There is nothing deep in this film. It's clear it was meant to be a mindless film, and I have no problem with that, but when even the action is awful, you're left withwell, nothing really.And as for that soundtrackit'll make the film look so incredibly dated in two years. At times the film feels like a low grade music video.If you want great chases, character and atmosphere, watch either Bullitt, or The Driver. If however, you want to watch a load of boring drag races conducted by two-dimensional characters in a one-dimensional script, watch the Fast and the Furious.One out of Five.",Andrew Burnet,"Aug 30, 2002"
No rating,Pure adrenaline rush!,"Only one word describes this action flick starring Paul Walker and Vin Diesel. Amazing! I'll be the first to admit, I wasn't exactly excited about cars and the things they can do, but now, after seeing this movie, it gets me pumped up to go do the exact same thing with my friends.The movie did have its downfalls. Such as the crappy dialogue. Okay, so there were more than it's fair share of stupid comments made. But one of the most popular movies in the past five years was exactly the same, The Matrix. I swear if I heard ""he is the one"" one more time, I was gonna put my foot through the damn VCR!Point is, people don't go to see movies for the acting. Leave that to the classy, Oscar winning pictures starring Gwyenth Paltrow and Ben Affleck. Did anyone rent or go to Barb Wire to see Pamela's acting ability? No, they saw it because she's one of the hottest women alive! I don't know about anyone else, but I can't see Tom Hanks or Denzel Washington in Vin Diesel and Paul Walker's shoes. It just doesn't work! What should be different about this movie?No matter what town or city you're in, you will see cars similar to the cars in this movie, and that's exactly why it's so popular. Who cares if you hate Hondas, Acuras, Toyotas, Mazdas or Nissans. There is no denying that they are the best made automobiles ever made.According to a lot of people in big cities, The Fast and the Furious wasn't exactly the most accurate portrayal of street racing in America, but it gave everyone a new prospective on street racing. In the car culture we live in, a movie like this needs to come out in order to shine light onto the subject. So what if there is cheesy dialogue, it wasn't written to win Oscars, it was written so they could put the nicest custom cars in the country on the big screen for people to enjoy.I give The Fast and the Furious 8 stars out of 10, because, much like myself, it gives people around the country and around the world a hobby to enjoy and to call their own. The movie showed the world what intense means. And if we lose good acting and a pleasable script in the process, who really cares.

6,"""The Fast and the Furious""- While the sequels have gotten better and better, the original feels a bit dated and ""safe."" Fun, but not as entertaining as future installments.","The interesting thing about the long-running ""Fast and Furious"" franchise is that series fans seem to fall into one of two camps. Those who feel that the series started off decent but has gotten progressively better with each passing sequel. Especially as they take themselves less seriously and simply aim to entertain their audience more and more with increasingly insane and physics-defying action. And those who far prefer the earlier and slightly tamer installments for their slightly more grounded realism. And they tend to lament the fact that the later sequels have gone in an increasingly unrealistic and over- the-top direction. And as a result, I feel I must warn certain audience members... I'm most certainly in the former of those two groupings. Yes, I am somewhat sorry to say that to me, the franchise as a whole really didn't start picking up steam until about the third or fourth chapter. While by no means terrible, the earlier films haven't aged particularly well at all, and feel quite... docile and bland. Even the subject of this review- the original 2001 release from director Rob Cohen. It's a standard story and spends so much time on a plot ripped straight from ""Point Break"" (only substituting cars instead of surf-boards), that it doesn't really entertain to the same wild extent that later installments eventually reached.The film follows detective Brian O'Connor (the late Paul Walker), as he goes undercover to infiltrate the underground world of illegal street racing in Los Angeles. O'Connor and his superiors suspect that the same men and women who hold these illegal events are also responsible for a string of crimes throughout the city. He eventually forms a sort-of friendship with Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), one of the most famed of the underground racers. O'Connors conflicted feelings about whether or not to bust him are further complicated when he starts to fall for Dominic's younger sister Mia (Jordana Brewster), and eventually his investigation will lead to a complex and wild finale through the streets of LA.The highlights here are the wonderful and at-the-time relatively unknown cast and the high-octane action that crops up here and there. This is the film that really put Vin Diesel and the others on the map. Everyone gives it their all, and everyone comes across very likable and endlessly cool in the film. Especially Diesel and Walker, who both shot to stardom in the months following the film's release. I also really liked Michelle Rodriguez, who plays a supporting role as Letty, Domonic's girlfriend. She has that tough- yet-sexy appeal and works really well in the film. Brewster and fellow co-stars like Rick Yune and Chad Lindberg similarly do admirable jobs. On the whole, just a great, fun cast.Director Rob Cohen, fresh off of a string of 90's hits including ""Dragonheart"" and ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"", does a phenomenal job handling the action and adventure with his kinetic camera-work and unique use of color and saturation. Say what you will about the mixed quality of the films he's made- the man can make a thrilling sequence. You really feel the speed in the races and each crash hits you right in the gut. This is amongst his best work as a visual storyteller, and he delivers the action full-throttle. When the film goes into full- blown carnage, it works marvelously.Unfortunately, the film falters quite a bit thanks to the aforementioned stock-screen writing and for being a bit too dated when viewed in comparison to the rest of the series. For all intents and purposes, there's not a lot going on ""under the hood"" here. Every twist and turn is telegraphed from a mile away, characters fall into broad and undeveloped clichés (usually given a single ""quirk"" to define them, which is lazy screen writing 101), and you'll know how it ends pretty much immediately. It takes away a lot of the experience. The fact that the film is also basically a photocopy of the superior ""Point Break"" is also distracting at times and can occasionally lead to a lot of unintended giggles. In addition, this film feels very much a product of its time. This has ""Extreme 2001 movie!"" written all over it. From the music to the editing to even the slang used in conversation... the film is dated to the point it even occasionally feels a bit cringe- worthy.Still, I don't think it's a bad movie. Just a troubled one. And I do think it is still most certainly worth seeking out, especially as a prerequisite to viewing the entire series. It sets up a lot of characters and context that are expanded on in later films, and there's a lot of fun to be had with the great performances and top-notch action. For my money... It's one of the weaker ""Fast & Furious"" films. But it's still a ""Fast & Furious"" film through-and-through. And I say give it a shot.I give it an about-average 6 out of 10.",TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"Apr 9, 2017"
10,Amazing!,"This movie had some strange appeal to me when I first saw the advertisments. I'm not a car person really, and I definately prefer a movie with a plot over action sequence after action sequence. But when I went to see this movie I was blown away! It was beautifully done, from the edge of your seat rush of the racing sequence to the excelent plot.Normally movies like this have no psychology to their characters, and though that wasn't the main focus, this movie did pull off having convincing and entertaining characters. It gave us a look at friendship, and showed us a whole other world not often portrayed in movies! Vin Diesel blew me away, a great talent I hadn't formerly seen.An excellent piece of cinema!I gave it a 10 out of 10.It pulled off exactly what it set out to do. It may not be one of those Oscar winners, but it wasn't meant to be. It was just a fun movie.",Destiny_Brent,"May 20, 2002"
6,First lap of ten - wait there's ten of these?,"Finally going to be chugging through this franchise, plainly just to see for myself how we go from here, a relatively chill street racing pomp thriller, to whatever the gargantuan hell was happening in Fast X, with cars launched into space and every apparent world leader trying to assassinate these people. If nothing else it'll be a teaching moment for how quickly a sense of scale and overall realism can be torpedoed by piling on sequels. Just making more and more films based solely on the idea of ""it has to be fast"" and ""it has to be furious.""There is a part of me itching to see precisely when the films drop the act of taking themselves even a little bit dramatically serious and lean into this bizarro teen guy dreamland, or maybe it's a gradual thing and each entry will get more and more stupid. Either way, I'm unreasonably excited. Unreasonably because there's already a lot of warning signs in this starter film - which is meant to be one of the bright spots in this decalogy - as no character is really given an identity apart from Paul Walker and Vin Diesel, the music cues are unmistakably 2001, and the most compelling story beats are given no conclusive explanation, just left to the dust as another neon-coloured attack to your eyes veers offscreen.

10,"Boy Oh Boy, Did This Movie ROCK!!!","Who couldn't like this movie, oh yea, obviously the one who I am mocking. But anyways, the cars made the movie, the action made the movie and oh yea, the actors too. Let me see you tell Vin Diesel he ""slept"" the whole movie. It's not like he won't break you w/ his 28"" arms, I mean the guy is built, intimidating. But back to the movie. If you like cars, street racing and watching a movie to see the cars only we can dream about this is it. Plus, these aren't fifth rate actors, because they spent money on the cars. Actually all the cars in the film were only frame work, so they didn't spend their money on the cars, nice try to dis the actors. See the movie, then rate it, don't listen to the ones that rip good movies.",puttz,"Apr 11, 2002"

1,Probably worse than Driven,"Once the trailer for this tripe had past my eyes I knew I was in trouble and it was only a matter of time before one of my less liked and mis-guided friends recommended this film to me.When will Hollywood learn. Racing movies are gung-ho trite. They are not even entertaining for there cheesey chliche material. Don't get me wrong I am a bit of a petrol head myself. I sit here typing this wearing my Jaguar racing shirt, but these movies must die.Friends of mine started defending this by say things like, ""Oh but you only see these films for the cars, action and jaunty camera angles."" Let me put this into perspective for you the ""Bad guys"" drive Honda Civics. My Girlfriend knows that Honda Civics aren't cool. My girlfriends parents own Honda Civics, they are 72 and 59. They did not purchase their Honda Civic because they thought it was a ""Bad Ass Piece of Machinery"". No matter how much nitro flames (the action) come from a Honda Civic does it become cool. Blurry camera shots also do not make this film. I'm not even gonna bother going into the plot because I find it affensive to human beings.",ajdewars,"May 6, 2002"
10,The best,I love fast and the furious. The acting is great and the main character is hot! It's my fav movie and when i wanna stay home and chill i pop in the dvd and watch it.

7,Gone in 10 seconds,"The film shows everything we missed so much in the much slower and much more boring film Gone in 60 seconds. Hot cars, hot babes, hot sound effects, fast camera work, no plot, I really has a great time. The carracing scenes are slowly built up to the maximum at the end of the film. Nice climax. Here we have a good example of how to tell a boring story very exciting.",Indian-Lord,"Oct 2, 2001"
1,A 2 hour out and out assault on my brain cells.,SUPERB COMEDY!BEST HORROR MOVIE IN YEARS! 2 Thumbs Up Vin Diesel.Id rate this 10/10 Simply coz it takes a hell of a lot of talent to create such utter crap. if u heard metal clanging was not from the movie. I was bangingn my head against my chair. Vin diesel can say a lot through his expressions such as 'Me want Banana' and 'Jane go nekkid nekkid now?'.If u think my review doesnt make sense you should see the movie.,TheNecromancer,"Jan 7, 2003"
No rating,"HOT GUYS,AWESOME CARS!!","Everyone was saying you gotta see this movie, you gotta see it. so i finally went out and bought it on DVD. I thought the characters were just real cool, the cars were very very cool and the guys were just hot. I really loved the character of Vin Diesel, he just came off to be the hard and rough guy and I really loved it! not to mention Paul Walker looked really good! and the chicks inspired me! I just thought it was a really great movie and I'm not the one that is into action movies, but from a girls' viewpoint, i think it's just great! also the soundtrack is really good also! i highly suggest to buy this right away!!",ShortyJame,"Jan 23, 2002"
6,"Ignore the haters, better than you'd expect","I admit I was skeptical about watching this movie before viewing it since the preview made it look like a shallow action film for teens with no substance whatsoever...and then there's Vin Diesel (and Ja Rule). But came away with a feeling of, well, not quite satisfaction, but definitely not discomfort as the haters (aka Internet movie nerds and ""critics"") bring forth in their reviews. Sure there is action, explosions, chases, hot chicks, etc. but that's to be expected from a film called ""The Fast and the Furious."" Indeed, it is fast with its MTV style editing with furious undertones of rage and violence and crime, but hey, it's a movie about criminal car racers for crying out loud.Yes the visuals are impressive and the sound is good too. The editing, lighting, cinematography and all the other technicals are well done. The acting...not so well done but not awful - there really isn't a whole lot, nor dialogue for that matter. But what makes the story compelling is its (simple yes, but intriguing nevertheless) character relationships which form the plot.Is this film over the top? Yes. But it is done in such a way that keeps you interested, and besides, since so few of us actually do know about the undercover world of streetcar racing, who are we to say what is real and what isn't? Besides, if you haven't been paying attention, this film is a male fantasy - muscles, guns, money, cars, women...like every other video on MTV (which explains the annoying soundtrack).This film is not a great movie, but it has no pretense of being one, and that is refreshing when so much crap out there does. It is a popcorn flick, instantly forgettable but watchable over and over nonetheless. Plus, watch the DVD extras as to how some impressive stunts were done, and your appreciation for this film will grow.OVERALL RATING: 6 of 10 stars. It won't hurt to watch this one, just remember to suspend your disbelief (you should anyway - it's a movie!)",camachoborracho,"Nov 24, 2004"
7,Unintentionally good for a laugh,"I rated this a 7 because I saw it in theaters when I was a teenager and it was pretty much the coolest thing ever and made for some good memories with friends. After having rewatched it recently I realized how dumb and immature I must have been back then. Decided to write my first review ever.The movie is visually great, good looking actors, cool cars for the time, most would say really hot girls although personally I only thought Mia was attractive. Music was good, cinematography was great, minus the few shakey camera race scenes. It had just enough action scenes to keep you interested and engaged.Now for the bad.. Acting and dialogue was atrocious, literally the cheesiest 1 liners i've ever heard in any movie ever, and its non stop throughout the whole movie. Vin diesel was okay considering what the actors had to work with. I Can't really think of a lead besides paul walker that would have made the movie any better, that being said he was terribly bad.(RIP) Chasing down Big Rigs with honda civics, jumping onto moving semi trucks going 70 mph makes absolutely no sense, Im sure they could have thought of an easier way to hijack the trucks, but they had to make it cool right? Paul Walker was literally the worst person ever to cast as an undercover cop, Michelle rodriguez was cringe and annoying to look at with a permanent scowl on her face trying to be more badass than vin diesel. Vince literally called Brian a Buster at one point, and I could literally go on forever with just how cheesy the movie is, dont even get me started on all the over the top unrealistic Car/Racing stuff. I just think the movie tried to take itself way too serious..Overall the movie is a good mindless watch, it really does make you laugh out loud even though its not trying to and even though the rest of the movies suck, this one however silly is an iconic film that won't be forgotten.",mikeyyo_,"Aug 5, 2023"
9,Unique and very entertaining,"It's pretty hard at this point in time to call anything ""groundbreaking"" in cinema, there's so much trash out there that is either eye candy, mindless or a rehash of some movie made much better years ago. I thought this one rises above other recent efforts largely because of the screen presence of Vin Diesel. Walker is undercover cop out to get behind recent truck-jackings in California. Diesel is an L.A. car hot-shot who is a prime suspect for the crimes. Walker insinuates himself into Vin's group and takes the lay of the land from there. Brewster is very attractive and effective as Diesel's sister and Walker's love interest. There's two things about this movie I think unique - Diesel's character (a strange mix of menace, indifference and personal loyalty), and the focus on the hopped-up econocar culture these guys operate in. I've seen bits and pieces of Diesel in other movies and he seems darker and less effective there, I think he worked well with the quietly upbeat Walker on this one. I'm hoping the new Fast & Furious can live up to this entry, well done!",RNMorton,"Apr 10, 2009"
6,"At least it was better than ""Driven""","Silly but somewhat entertaining teen version of ""Driven"".  Vin Diesel walks thru his role as the leader of a pack of street racers who may or may not be hijacking truckers.  Paul Walker has yet to be tested in a serious role and he is not here.  This movie is mostly about the cars and action.  The actors are there simply to drive and repair them.  But as I said, at least it was better than Driven! 6/10",dlmiley,"Jun 30, 2001"
10,I really enjoyed this movie!!!,"I believe The Fast and the Furious was a really cool movie. The action is great. The cast was great and the cars were awesome. This movie really shows the action and drama of street car racing. It captures the joy, pain, and thrill of the actual racing. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants thrill, excitement, and just an overall good movie. My rating-10.",FunkyzBabe2,"Jan 22, 2002"
6,"A fun, if brainless, start to a successful franchise","Never in a million years would I, sitting in the cinema (with my mum and stepfather, oddly enough) back in 2001, think that the auto-porn I had just witnessed would kick-start a hugely successful franchise due it's seventh instalment next year in 2015. Not that I didn't enjoy the 90 minutes of homoerotic machismo, endless gear-stick changes, scantily-clad gyrators and a cameo by Ja Rule - I actually found it highly entertaining in a Point Break (1991) sort-of-way - it's just that how much of an audience can a film about cars draw? Lots, it would seem.Undercover L.A.P.D. officer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is assigned to infiltrate a gang of street-racers led by the notorious Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) after a series of high-speed truck hijackings using pimped-out Honda Civics. A highly competent driver himself, Brian uses his skills to befriend Dominic, while falling for his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster). After saving Dominic from the police, Brian earns his respect but not that of his crew, and when Dominic proves himself generous and loyal to those who offer him the same, Brian must choose between protecting his new friend and arresting the criminal he has been assigned to bring down.The Fast and the Furious' script is often bad enough to make your ears bleed. This is a film where words of wisdom are offered in the form of ""it's not how you stand by your car, it's how you race your car,"". But it's delivers on what the title promises, and the action scenes are well-staged and it's nice to see real metal bend and break in an increasingly CGI-reliant marketplace. It's loud and often crude, but the two leads of obvious limited acting range prove likable and actually generate some chemistry. It's difficult to say where the franchise will go after the sad death of Paul Walker last year, but this first instalment was a fun, if brainless, start.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",tomgillespie2002,"Dec 15, 2014"
1,"nice cars, bad acting","If you like hot import cars and hardcore street racing, then watch videos of real life on the internet, instead of seeing this movie. This is a fine example of how predictable movies have become and how they are just used to make already famous sellouts like Ja Rule look better, when it just waters down their originality and makes them become mainstream chumps. Well i have too short of an entry so i guess i will talk about how cheesy Vin Diesel is as an actor and this is why we only see him in these over budgeted-for having such a lame plot type of movies, just like Ja Rule. i think this movie was just a waste of money and should not of got so much credit for being a good MOVIE, while in reality it was just a bunch of really nice imports racing about. i like those cars just as much as the next guy, but as a movie its just garbage.",Gberry-6,"Jan 24, 2005"

7,Fast & Furious - When Speed Replaces the Brain,"Toretto rules the streets of Los Angeles like a roaring warlord, with cars tricked out like modern knights' armor ready to slap you at 250 km/h. Paul Walker shows up, flashing his Colgate smile, to go undercover and bust the baddies hijacking semi-trucks. But instead of arresting anyone, he falls in love-with speed, adrenaline, and a bromance with Vin Diesel, the bald powerhouse who values engines more than logic. Basically, it's Point Break with chrome rims and blue neon lights under the hood.The dialogue? A mix of auto mechanic manuals and teenage trash talk. The supporting characters? As deep as an oil puddle. But let's be real-you're not here for philosophical monologues on turbochargers. You're here for insane races where drivers shift gears 14 times in 200 meters, all while smirking in the face of physics. And on that front, the movie delivers.Vin Diesel is like a tank: slow, powerful, and impossible to stop once he's rolling. The guy exudes more presence with a few grunts than some actors do with entire Shakespearean soliloquies. His Dom Toretto is part Mad Max warrior, part toxic older brother who teaches you to tune your car while dragging you into life-or-death street races.Walker plays the undercover cop who transitions from clean-cut officer to the guy who could steal your girlfriend and your car in the same night. His internal conflict? Loyalty: one day he's a cop, the next he's chugging lukewarm beers in Dom's garage, preaching the gospel of ""family forever."" But let's be honest, with that charm, he could've infiltrated any gang and gotten adopted like a lovable Labrador.Let's face it-the real stars of Fast & Furious are the cars. From souped-up Civics to iconic muscle cars, every scene is a tribute to mechanical overkill. Even when the gravity-defying stunts make you roll your eyes, you can't help but admire the spectacle, like watching a fireworks display at a cheap neighborhood fair.Fast & Furious doesn't pretend to be anything more than a motorized stress reliever. If you're hoping for introspective drama, go watch some Bergman. Here, it's all about pedal to the metal, dodging cops, and never hitting the brakes. It smells like gasoline, leather jackets, and bro-talk, but somehow, it's ridiculously fun.",OniFR,"Feb 3, 2025"
1,I've seen better things in my cat's litterbox,"This movie was a real turd. It's ""Point Break"", but with souped up Hondas instead of surfboards. The dialog was awful. There were so many cheesy lines that I couldn't contain my laughter. Hopefully there won't be any more movies made in this nitrous injected genre.",peppercat2000,"Sep 2, 2002"
No rating,I'm a car fan and enjoyed the movie,"As i am a fan of modified cars, this movie was a great movie in my view. the cars were fast, the women attractive as they come, and it portrayed the street racing as it is. Except of course the whole truck stealing thing. one of the most annoying parts of this movie for me was in some of the racing scenes the camera bounced around as if mounted n a horse trying to keep up and in a couple of places almost made me sea sick, but dont see this as being in all the race scenes, just a couple.The car modifications done and the custom bodykits makes this a feast for your eyes, and the orange supra at the end is really something to behold.The acting, although not oscar winning stuff, was not too bad, i would rate the acting, as well as the story above starship troopers style B grade. The storyline, although predictable, was not too bad, and followed the typical ""undercover cop makes buddies with the bad guy, then has to give him up"" style of movie, but i still found it enjoyable.I think in the end, you will have to go see it for yourself to really make up your mind.",ronin02,"Sep 22, 2001"
6,One of the 'better' cool car style-focused action flicks of the turn of the century,"""The Fast and The Furious"" was the ""Point Break"" of the 2000s — a cop goes undercover to bust up a group of criminals who are into a specific ""sport,"" but he becomes attached to the very people he's trying to bust. ""Point Break"" is the better film, but ""The Fast and the Furious"" was the start of a multi-billion-dollar franchise. Go figure.Paul Walker plays the cop, Brian O'Conner, but the screenplay doesn't reveal this card until Brian has not only won the respect of top street racer Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), but also the viewer. This small betrayal of our trust is writer Gary Scott Thompson's shrewdest move as the film goes from somewhat interesting, albeit cliché, to more interesting, albeit cliché.The screenplay — co-written with Erik Bergquist and David Ayer (""Training Day"") based on the ""VIBE"" magazine article by Ken Li — is not the focal point of the movie, of course. This was 2001, the peak of the MTV Spring Break era. The point was to show hot foreign cars, hot foreign (and American) women and a lot of burning rubber. The rock, rap and techno music of the time feature prominently, and even rapper Ja Rule had a supporting role as a racer, a reminder of how the start of the 21st century was also the beginning of the music business starting to infiltrate the movie business.All this to say, director Rob Cohen understands this is a style over substance situation. Quarter-mile races, chases, fist fights and criminal heist activity are the featured attractions — as are the beautiful cars and beautiful people. If this film can be given any credit for originality, it belongs to the merging of heist/crime movie and drag race aesthetics. Cars had of course been featured in movies and television before, but this movie more authentically plays to the car aficionado, as a handful of films did in this era (e.g. ""Gone in 60 Seconds,"" ""The Italian Job""). There's a certain grittiness that this film has featuring real street-racing cars compared to James Bond, for example, driving something too cool to believe.The movie isn't 100 percent shallow from start to finish, however. A genuine effort is made to build chemistry between Walker and Diesel's characters. The story works best when it builds and tests that relationship. Nothing else about the movie feels worth our investment, but somehow we desperately do not want Brian and Dom to turn on each other despite all the reasons they should. Both Walker and Diesel bring likable dimensions to their characters and their chemistry is likely to be the bedrock of future films. (This coming from someone who has yet to see any of the other films yet.)The supporting cast, however, doesn't offer much. Dom's girlfriend, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), brings nothing to the story, and the other guys in Dom's gang aren't given the chance to be anything but meatheads. The romance between Brian and Dom's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) exists for formulaic reasons, but the fact that both of them feel kind of like outsiders to the street-racing culture gives their relationships some legitimacy.But enough about characters. ""The Fast and the Furious"" delivers some solid action sequences, especially the ones involving street cars and semi trucks. The racing scenes don't allow for much dimension, and the editing is decent to optimize suspense, but the CGI and green screen elements pull us out of what should feel like a very realistic, gritty street race. There are enough quality moments for action fans in ""The Fast and the Furious"" to overcome the MTV Spring Break music video world its characters inhabit. The 2000s were full of glossy movies with inferior story lines, and while comparing ""The Fast and the Furious"" to these films would obviously make it seem like a great movie when in fact it's an average one, it could be a suitable enough ambassador of its time and culture to movie watchers of the future.~Steven CThanks for reading!

10,A great movie with great cars,"This movie is my favorite movie of all time- the acting was great, the story line was great and it was very fast, action-packed and well... furious!!! I loved how the movie allowed the viewer to create their own ending for themselves, and how Dominic Toretto being the villain was such a surprise. I really believed the hi-jackers were Johnny Tran and his gang!!! I would have never expected The Team.  The love between Brian Spilner and Mia Toretto was an added twist, giving the movie a lot more feeling to it then just fast women and fast cars.  Letty was great, she has an attitude that I totally agree with- it's time for the guys to take a back seat and let the girls show their stuff.  She also doesn't put up with crap from other girls when they are hitting on her man!!!  Leon and Jesse are great additions, Jesse being comical, but also being a very leading role in the whole situation.  Vince was a jerk, but without him, the movie would definitely not have been complete.  The cars were just sic, the effects and the drag racing making your adrenaline pump along with the characters'.  This movie held me spellbound in the theaters and I have watched it at least 10 times so far on the DVD, never tiring of it once.

6,Not really all that good.,"Last year I rented FAST FIVE despite not really caring about the previous flicks. I had only seen the first film when it came out and some of TOKYO DRIFT on TV. I gave the fifth film a shot anyway because the trailers made it look really fun and it got good word of mouth. To my surprise, I enjoyed it. It was a nice fun stunt car heist flick with no pretensions of being anything other than it was.So here I am, watching the first film and I quickly realize why I didn't embrace the series during its initial films. This first installment is basically POINT BREAK with cars, but without The Buse. The first race is pretty fun at first but after that it just didn't do much for me. It takes itself too seriously and Paul Walker isn't really much of a leading man to carry the drama this flick tries to inject with the whole thing with him being torn between friendship and duty. Boring.",tmm_8705,"Jun 28, 2013"
1,Do fast cars give you a woody?,"This movie was terrible, no other words can sum it up.I'd like to think of myself as a connoisseur of the late 80's action movie genre, so it's not like I am some highbrow egghead who can't appreciate a good action movie.Frankly this movie is nothing more than an excuse to bring out some flashy cars and drive them around really, really fast... gee doesn't it give you a woody just thinking about it? Well I reckon it must have given some executive a woody, thus draining the blood from his brain and rendering him unable to reject signing-off on this stupid film. This movie had a non-existent plot, crappy acting and dialogue - even for an ""action"" movie.Unless you are one of these types with an IQ lower than their shoe size who gets off over fast cars - forgetaboutit!",arkanis50,"Feb 21, 2002"

It was really obvious from the posters and straplines that this was going to be an all-out action, over-the-top, slightly unbelievable cheesefest, and indeed it was.  I left the cinema with a grin on my face and a desire to stick some nitrous under the hood of my car.  Yes, the plot was a direct lift from 'Point Break' but who cares?  It worked well and it was entertaining and fun.  What more would you really be asking from a movie like this?  Two very definite thumbs up.",mehlindi,"Mar 14, 2002"
6,A Superior 21st Century B Movie,"In terms of the profile of the performers involved and the money spent on its production, this film seems to be a minor picture in comparison to the megabucks blockbusters the studios release. However, considering it was made by a major studio and apes the style of the blockbusters, you can't really call this an Independent picture either. It seems the best way to define this movie is as a B-Movie, changes in film convention and monetary inflation notwithstanding.This is not intended to devalue the film - Assault on Precinct 13, New Jack City and some of the best movies of the 1940s were B-movies. All it means is it doesn't have stars and doesn't pretend to be a particularly original work of art, and would consider itself a success if enough people buy tickets for it to make its money back. Many such films are forgettable, some are patently awful, some are entertaining on some level, while a few manage to hit the right mixture and make for very good cinema. They also used to provide a great breeding ground for new talent to try their luck with limited resources and less risk than the big leagues, and the cinema could do with more such opportunities for new film-makers to try out. ""The FastAnd The Furious"" doesn't quite hit the heights achieved by John Carpenter's early work or the golden age of Noir but I'm certainly not sorry I watched it.Paul Walker comes across as a blond Keanu but is engaging as the undercover cop investigating high-speed robberies whose culprits seem to hang around the illegal street racing scene in LA. Vin Diesel (who was superb as the convict in Pitch Black) is charismatic in the more interesting ""guy on the edge"" role, and everyone else does their job effectively. The familiar story follows of an undercover mission  becoming complicated by loyalty, emotions, and things not being as simple as they look, with some good high speed driving sequences along the way. The performances, direction, characterisation and dialogue are not exactly Oscar-winning but to use the racing analogies used by all the papers who reviewed this movie, it is flashy, has a good engine and overcomes a slight lack of finesse through pace and energy. Better still, you can tell from the opening titles and delirious first race that this is not intended as anything more than fun entertainment, so you forgive the cliches and occasional false move from the script. It certainly stands comparison with any of the $100m mega productions against which it was competing.The whole thing plays out nicely to a big action finale, and it chooses one of the handful of recognised ways for a story like this to end. Overall, it was a fun movie and worth watching once for anyone who likes a bit of unpretentious high speed fun. Rent the video, relax and enjoy.",jim.adamson,"Mar 27, 2002"
1,An action film with no action,"Well, I suppose the best way to review a film is compare it to your expectations. What I expected was a wafer thin plot, even less acting, and lots of fast, insane and fun car chases to fill up my afternoon and forget about the next morning.What I got of cause was, a wafer thin plot, even less acting...and no fast insane and fun car chases. The cars were supposed to be the big thing in the film. But all they do is spend a fortune on building up the car and then drag race it down a road. No turns, leaps, death-defying dives between city traffic, and no tense racing. Just hit the metal, and whoever spent the most money and had the most nitro wins.And the story made even less sense (what the hell is with that fight at the start?), the script seems to have never been through a redraft, and most of the actors were permanently comatose. There is nothing deep in this film. It's clear it was meant to be a mindless film, and I have no problem with that, but when even the action is awful, you're left with.well, nothing really.And as for that soundtrack.it'll make the film look so incredibly dated in two years. At times the film feels like a low-grade music video.If you want great chases, character and atmosphere, watch either Bullitt, or The Driver. If however, you want to watch a load of boring drag races conducted by two-dimensional characters in a one-dimensional script, watch the Fast and the Furious.One out of Five",Andrew Burnet,"Sep 1, 2002"
No rating,Better than i expected,"I´ve just seen this movie and i like it. As simple as that.A cop that gets involved in a gang of thieves that like to make races in their cars, and, of course, steals cool things. The movie it´s ok, the races are good and dialogs are good too.A kind of Point Break, that one with keanu reeves and Patrick Swayze......but with no surfers, no masks and no sunburned...just cars, cars and.....girls. 7/10",cyco50,"Feb 20, 2002"
6,An inconsistent attempt at what could have been so much more.,"Taking one of the words out of the title, I am furious that the film did not live up to its potential.  By this I mean the fact that yet again, we have a dumb Hollywood script laden with the corniest lines imaginable.  Credibility is also riding high in deficiency, when you consider the fact that Vin Diesel's character must be invincible, seeing as how he manages to escape injury, after colliding with a truck at over 150 mph.  Retreating back from the criticism for a moment, the cars in the film are breathtaking and the score certainly pumps out serious wattage--although that's the problem, the cars are the focus point and being that's the case, shouldnt Rob Cohen (the director) have constructed better action sequences, that actually had depth enough to keep his audience entertained.  You would think so.Struggling to find a commendable word to say I can only consider the aspects about the film that could have been so easily improved, given the subject matter; if you think about it fast cars, babes, violence and sex should make for a solid, thrilling 90 minutes.  Instead we settle for the sluggish, dull experience that most of us would gladly replace with GONE IN 60 SECONDS any day of the week.  Let's face it at least GONE IN 60 had Angelina, not to mention action guru Jerry Bruckheimer on board.Despite the distinct lack of praise from, well a large proportion of the western hemisphere, 'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS' still managed to be lucrative by taking $144 million at the US box office.  Are those Japanese imports really that amazing?",adamhart-1,"Mar 16, 2002"
7,"Cars, speed, babes, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker","Some would love this movie, others wouldn't but you can deny The Fast and The Furious started a trend which is still on going today. Never Street Racing has been so popular since this movie came out.The street races are beautifully done and care had been applied to get the audience feeling the power and the adrenaline the pilots must feel behind the wheel of those road beasts full of NOS. There is no need to say that this is the signature of the entire series. Whatever the plot is, there is always a street race going on and each one of them is masterfully shot and scripted. This series is first of all a tribute to the cars and the driving skills of their pilots.The other asset of this movie are Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. The first one is playing Dominic Torretto, all in muscle respected and regarded as the leader of the entire LA racing community. Like her sister Mia says, everyone is attracted and orbits around Dom. Paul Walker is Brian O'Conner a promising undercover cop tasked to bring down Torretto and his team. He is definitely cute, bold and has racing in his blood. This duo are bearing the movie on their shoulders. When one is missing it has not the same impact.",AmyJenson1995,"Oct 4, 2015"

6,A racing movie with slight depth,"Rating-6/10The Fast and Furious is a racing movie, with crime, that also serves thrills and spills all over the workshop. This is the kind of movie we so often dislike but for me, this isn't dislikeable and is actually an OK piece of film, a kind of ""give it a go"" kind of movie. The whole show is pretty well made and no one can deny the stunts involved aren't fantastically done, and the plot is actually not half bad at all.Brian O'Conner(Paul Walker) is a cop racing in street races, trying to infiltrate racing gangs and the like, and to be fair Walker does it kind of nicely. I did feel out of the main cast that Walker feels the most uncomfortable, but he still manages to lead the movie out well enough. Vin Diesel as the gang leader Dominic is OK too, he actually outshines everybody here and his acting skill really comes through for me here, proves what he has in the locker.Rob Cohen directs this a bit OK, not great but he steadies it, the film could have been more on point at times but nevertheless he still catches the right feeling the script gives off. And on that note the film Is written much the same, missed opportunities here and there and massive cheesy lines can harm it, but I think by the end of the story, your hooked on the adrenaline junkie action, rather than the wording choices. The movie has a glitzy look about it, this is Hollywood through and through and yet that doesn't matter, it feels raw enough to be believable and the stars of the movie are not famous enough for this to be yet another big budget action thriller movie, that tries too hard to be cool. The cars are for me not that nice, the one thing that really gets annoying after a while is bright green cars etc with racing stripes of fire, the cars go fast and this is good for petrol heads, but the look of it is pretty awful.I said about the stunts and there is no denying the stunts are good, there not gravity defying like so many of the sequels(Fast and Furious 7 has just left cinemas at the time of this review), they are well done and basic, sure the effects used in the cars whilst racing is ridiculous, but the fast crashes and kind of crazy things that go on, make this exciting and personally I enjoyed it quite a little bit.You know I hear a lot of people claim this is ""only for the boys"", but please disregard that, not only it being sexist but also that this actually contains depth in the story, not just mindless racing. I mean the depth is pretty high up, this only just scrapes the surface but it still has more than the cars. I felt the plot which I will not ruin for those who haven't seen, is good and it makes this kinda fun but at the same time thrilling, you honestly don't know what will happen, and although the story does play out rather basic, It still contains a fun story.Overall this is one fast paced movie I can recommend, now don't be won over by it like so many can, this honestly isn't a masterpiece of any kind, but still worth a view. I didn't feel bored at any times, all my focus was on the characters and how they develop and I think that you too can enjoy it, If you focus on one particular part, and not the cheese that this movie truly is.",willcundallreview,"Jun 6, 2015"
10,Its about friendship and trust!,"Yes, it's a bit cheesy and old school but if you like the movies then you realise that the first one is about true friendship and trust and this is what I like about it.

10,What A Great Ride!,"I had so much fun watching this movie that I went back 9 more times!  I made sure that I took different friends every time and none of them ever complained either.  Three of them were indifferent, but the other six said they honestly got a kick out of it the high energy, special effects, beautiful people and beautiful cars!I loved TFATF because it never pretended to be anything more than what it turned out to be.....  A great action flick with lots of speed and color. No one was pretending this was Shakespeare, but each actor gave his/her performance his/her best shots.  Yes, they are ""callow youths"" and the story was pretty much unbelievable, but hey!!  That is why I go to movies.  I go to suspend belief and be entertained and amused.  When I want to get intellectual and ""think"", I stay home and read a serious book.
I loved this lightweight piece of fluff.  It was great fun and I made sure to buy the DVD when it came out so that I can revisit the color, action and speed whenever I please.

1,Total garbage.,"Ridiculously bad movie.  Obviously written by a couple of just-post pubescents, who think that souped up Honda's chasing each other is ""Waaaay cool!""  This film has no redeeming qualities.  If you want to watch a movie about ""guys racing for pink slips"", watch American Graffiti instead - at least IT has a plot.  And in American Graffiti, the cars are some REAL metal, not some goofy, tricked out Hondas that annoy old folks by driving down streets with their stereos with waaaaay too much bass that you can hear from 2 miles away.I just recently watched this film, and I can honestly say that I don't remember anything about a ""plot.""  A plot would just get in the way of ""cars going dangerously fast down city streets.""  There were no notable quotes. There was no notable acting.  Vapid - completely lacking any merit whatsoever.Lousy movie, Mel, I give a 1 - but only because the scale doesn't go down any further.",jtkaylor,"Aug 24, 2002"

Anyway, my friend dragged me along, and couldnt get me out of the theatre. It was SOOO good!!! The music was fantastic,the cars were so cool,the actors all did relly well, the whole thing was great. And responding to people who have panned this awesome flick, id like to know what they thought of Pauly Shore's latest - this flick was too good to be true! What more could you want?

7,The Fast and the Furious (2001) When everything was simpler,"The first film in the Fast and Furious franchise is much simpler than the later ones. Here, the film focuses on something much less megalomaniacal and seeks to explore only street racing. The simplicity of the script is what makes this first film good. As much as the script is flawed when it comes to the police investigation, this doesn't sound like a problem. At no point does the film propose to be an investigation like Se7en. The focus here is entirely on the action. The setting makes the FBI plot consistent with the rest of the story. At no point does the film require an Oscar-worthy performance from the characters, so Vin Diesel and Paul Walker manage to deliver a good job, precisely because they are just charismatic and get along well. The first film in the franchise is good for not trying to be more than it is. He does what he sets out to do and does it effectively.",claszdsburrogato,"Jan 6, 2024"
6,Good start to a great action-packed film franchise,"I love FAST AND FURIOUS movies, so I thought, ""What if I reviewed these movies?"", so I will review each film from the original film to the new film.So, I begin my second franchise review with the original 2001 film, The Fast and the Furious.The Fast and the Furious was not only released on June 22, 2001 to financial success and mixed reviews, but it also launched the careers of nearly all of it's stars, including Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, who would later become household names, as well as Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez.The film is directed by Rob Cohen with a screenplay by David Ayer, who wrote the 2001 film Training Day and co-wrote this film with two other writers including the creator of the franchise, Gary Scott Thompson.The film follows undercover cop Brian O'Conner who must stop semi-truck hijackers led by criminal and wanted fugitive Dominic Toretto from stealing expensive electronic equipment while developing a relationship with Dominic's sister, Mia Toretto and forming a friendship with Dominic.That is just a quick summary. I won't go into too much of the plot, because a lot of people should know what is the main premise of the story in this film and the other Fast and Furious movies. The franchise would later go to move away from the underground street racing plot into a plot much more cooler with the heist of $100 million dollars, gun fights and brawls and the movie that would change this franchise and bring new life into it would be the fifth entry in the series, released in April of 2011, Fast Five.The story is just really cool and amazing, but is not Oscar worthy, but the dialogue is the movie can get a little weak on a few occasions, but not throughout the whole darn movie.The action is just top-notch and the car chases in this film is as intense and action-packed as they would be later on in the franchise. My favorite car chase is at the beginning of the film and at the end of the film involving Dominic and Brian driving.The acting is just dreadful, but not all of it is. I will give credit to Vin Diesel, who plays Dominic Toretto and he pulls it off wonderfully, but while it's not Oscar worthy, he does show emotion, drama and laughter into his character. Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz, is great in this film and she would remain in that part for the other films and she would play in James Cameron's groundbreaking special-effects extravaganza Avatar and in the 2002 action-horror / zombie movie film based on the survival video game, Resident Evil.The other two that also does a great job is definitely Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster, who plays Brian O'Conner and Mia Toretto, and they do a very decent good job with the material written for them and they have such a great chemistry on the screen.Dominic Toretto's team members are just good. The actors who play the people in his crew is just incredible, with the exception of Matt Schulze as Vince.The music and soundtrack is really cool and Ja Rule is in this film, playing the role of Edwin and he provides music on the soundtrack.Overall, The first and original FAST AND THE FURIOUS is really good, but can get a little confusing in a few areas. I give it a 6 out of 10. It's not the best score, but certainly not the worst. This film is worth the watch and worth buying on DVD and Blu-Ray or watching on basic cable and Video on Demand or Xfinity Streampix.",joshuadrake-39480,"Apr 24, 2015"
10,Brilliant,"All I can say about this film is that's one of the best racing films I've seen in years, the use of sound is amazing the engines roar from here there and everywhere, yeah so the story maybe a bit thin and it may seem that you are watching the film version of the game Driver.  But all in all it's a none stop thrill of fast cars and brilliant action sequences from the great Rob Cohen (Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story), My recommendation is that if you haven't seen it then WHY NOT.",remergence98,"Feb 14, 2002"
6,Cinematography was great despite bad plot and acting,"This movie was all in all o.k., but the only reason I stayed through the whole thing was the spectacular camera angles and directing. Everything else in this film was bad :the acting, writing and plot. The whole scene where Vin Diesel, ""Dominic"",  was talking about how his father died was such forced sentiment I almost laughed. A movie like this should never try to pull at heart strings because it isn't working.",SpecialKinFla,"Jul 13, 2001"
8,Still one of the best action movies.,"If you're looking for a fast-paced, action-packed movie with a thumping soundtrack and fantastic photography and cinematograpy, you can't go wrong with 'The Fast and The Furious'.With a franchise now spawning 9 films and a 10th in the making, this original film is still by far the best. (Since number 6, the films became overblown on all levels almost to the point of becoming fantasy or superhero movies, and I lost interest). The incredibly awesome cars are bound to give car enthusiasts an instant orgasm. They are STUNNING!Paul Walker plays a cop who goes undercover to infiltrate a team of street racers, suspected of hijacking trucks and stealing their goods. As luck would have it - surprise, surprise - he falls for the leader's sister. The leader being Dom, portrayed by Vin Diesel. The casting in general is very good and the experienced cast ensure credibility. 'The Fast and the Furious' is an action movie with substance, nice fleshed out characters and a good story. The sound effects are also excellent.Mother Mary, the stunts are incredible!! The truck scene towards the end is nail-biting fun. And the finale is stunning. Quite an adrenaline rush, really. With all the cars, action, adventure and great soundtrack, 'The Fast and the Furious' was destined to become a hit! This is a thrilling action movie to enjoy again and again.",paulclaassen,"Jul 21, 2020"

Again they think we are dumb enough to don't realize it.THE MOVIE: I don't even know if i can call it a movie, when i finished watching it, all i could remember were cars, and hot women, and cars and women and some cars with women.

7,Fast And Furious,"The plot of this film is actually blunt and simple in logic, without all the thrills and twists in ordinary police movies. While performing an undercover mission, Brian fell in love with Dom's sister, and was also infected by Dom's personality charm. In the end, he solved the case but let him go, which was a very reasonable and natural ending. Although the plot is ordinary, by interspersing various racing elements, the whole film is still very fresh and watchable, giving the audience a brand new concept of speed.This film has given us too many interpretations of racing, passion, and friendship. It is obviously very exciting and fresh, but it also conveys some very traditional and warm concepts, and it has well established the plot, background and identity of the characters.",y-65186-04270,"Sep 25, 2023"

No rating,Adreneline Rush Popcorn flick.,"Having read the other comments on the Fast and the Furious after watching the film and its making of feature on DvD. I felt I had to add my own comments on the movie. Yes granted its storyline of undercover cop starts liking the world he infiltrates isnt that great. But I didnt put the Fast and the Furious in my DvD player expecting an expertly crafted character piece. I wanted an action movie seeing as this what it seemed to be advertising itself as. If you want a great car chase movie, full of some expertly shot set pieces like the attacks on the trucks, the drag races and the final shot of the charger flipping of the truck then this movie delivers in spades. It easily ranks alongside the classic car movies of all time, granted its no Bullit or the Italian Job. But its just as good as Gone in Sixty Seconds, and for any fan's of the playstation and PS2 Gran Turismo series of games its great to see hollywood recognise the coolness of Asian cars like the Supra, Civic etc. As an action movie it scores 7/10 as aside from some interesting shots it isnt that original if your a complete petrol head or love seat of the pants movies add another point or 2!",andyspruce,"Feb 12, 2002"

The only things in this movie I wasn't a fan of was the acting (which was fair at BEST) and some of the distractions in the plot (like with the police, crime element, etc). Sometimes it focused too much on that instead of the cars, racing, and action which is why someone would watch a movie like this I assume? There were 3 or 4 really good scenes with those things that saved the movie for me. Overall kind of a mixed bag for a first installment but hopefully I'll end up liking the sequels more with the more modern it gets and higher the stakes with the characters as time goes on.",SPZMaxinema,"May 26, 2023"

This is a movie with a topic that is not talked about a lot,and definitly doesn't have a lot of movies talking about it, and it's a very interesting subject.  The actors played their parts very well and where great co-stars for the awesome cars in this movie.  I'll say if you dont like cars,racing,and action then this probably isn't the movie for you.

6,Completely forgettable entertainment,"I waited a pretty long time before seeing this movie because I didn't want to deal with the rice rocket rallies during the first few weekends.  I knew, just from the previews, that it would attract a large audience, no matter whether it was actually a decent film or not.  After seeing it, I have to admit, once I turned off the analytical part of my brain, I enjoyed it. While it's definitely true that the screenplay was trite and predictable and most of the actors were seemingly hired based on looks rather than talent, this film was saved by a few things.  The most obvious of this film's saviors was the outstanding camera work during the films many chase/race sequences.  Also, Vin Diesel has a magnetic charisma that makes his even his non-racing scene watchable.  A few of the other actors, in particular Michelle Rodriguez, turn in passable performances too, although I'm definitely not impressed by pretty boy Paul Walker, who phones in a typical and contrived performance.  Overall, if, like me, you're able to turn off the part of your brain that wants you to scream ""Who talks like that???"", then you'll probably find this an enjoyable film, if forgettable, film. 3/5",mattdvs,"Jul 31, 2001"

I went on opening night at 11pm and the theater was standing room only.I have to say I was a little disappointed that the cars used were so common. It doesn't take any inspiration to build an Eclipse or a Honda.  Anyway, the rest of the film was amazing, down to detailing how most of us get our amazing ""paint"" jobs!This film was fantasy, but these people are real.  I live this life everyday, except highjacking tractor trailers. But a word of caution, do not try to drive under a truck.  The one used in the film was raised.  And don't race on surface streets.  It happens, but it's extremely dangerous.When I left the theater, about 120 of the hooked cars in town fled in a continuous line to a road across town, where we cruised for the next four hours.I can't wait till the sequel comes out.

7,A Guilty Pleasure Movie at its Finest,"16 years and 7 films ago the Fast & Furious franchise wasn't the worldwide phenomena that it is now. It was once a cheesy Point Break rip-off that took itself way too seriously. But you know what, it was a darn good guilty pleasure movie. That's for sure.A lot has changed over the years in the series, but the one constant has always been that the films are about family. For all its faults, no one can deny how well this film does the family angle. It's not the best acting, writing, or directing, but you care enough about the characters to where you believe the motivations behind characters' actions regarding family. But let's talk about how ridiculous, stupid, and fun this movie is.They drive their cars (successfully) underneath semi-trucks several times throughout the film. So much so that when I was younger I believed it was possible. That word, ""possible"", will be used sparingly through the course of this film and the entire series. Where Furious 7 pushes the boundaries of reality by driving cars via one building to the next, The Fast and the Furious provides the unbelievable through street car races with seemingly a few hundred people. In the middle of the night, that is. Oh and those hundreds of people each have their own car and parking spot, that is. But that won't be the last time the film could have you roll your eyes.In fact, it's way easier to watch this film now that I've seen every installment to date. This film is extremely dated, but it's an interesting watch, especially considering where the series has gone to now. There's an underground motorcycle gang who steals DVD players and stashes them in a Thai-food restaurant. The climax of the film begins at an event called Race Wars. Creative huh? At one point, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) tells someone to back off or she will scar her face with tire tracks. I guess my point is, if you don't accept the film for what it is, I don't think you'll have any fun with it.The real joy of this film comes by its goofiest and most outlandish moments, but also with its impressive stunts and action. In camera stunts may be this franchise's finest assets, and the last highway heist in this film is a thing of beauty. Yes, the film gets bogged down by a really dated and contrived script, but there's so much undeniable fun to be had here. A guilty pleasure movie at its best+Stunts/action+All about family+Ridiculously goofy/fun-Horrible script, and passable acting-Takes itself a little too serious at times7.5/10",ThomasDrufke,"Apr 4, 2017"
2,"come on, people!","This movie is nothing more than a rework of Point Break (remember, Reeves and Swayze)!  I don't wanna hold your hand and walk you through it, just think about it.  It's the exact same story with the exact same elements. Sure, they changed actors and names and the extreme sport they were involved in, but that's about it.  Everything else is a near duplicate.To me, this movie is not much more than a slap in the collective public's face by the studio.Vin Diesel is obviously too good for this kind of movie.  He must be using this kind of crud to show that he has box office draw, so that one day he can actually work on something good.I don't know what's going on with Walker.  I've seen more emotion in coffee tables.This is a must see if you want to see Hollywood swallowing it's own tail.",ImmortalCorruptor,"Mar 6, 2003"
No rating,great special fx,"Decent movie, great cars, great special effects... but can we all say: ""Point Break""...  I would have liked the story and characters more if I hadn't seen them all on surfboards a few years ago.Overall, liked it.",jenn-68,"Jan 15, 2002"
7,The Original and still worth the watch,"This is where it all started. The Fast and The Furious franchise has become a bit of a meme with how many there have been, but the success of the franchise owes it all to this original movie that changed the way an entire generation of men looked at cars (for better or for worse). I am not into most of the cars featured, but American Muscle makes an appearance as well in a great way. The story, the acting, the action, it is all good in this movie and it is easy to understand why the franchise has had so much success. It is the kind of movie where you walk out of the theatre and drive home a little bit more quickly because you feel like you are transported right into their world.",jaredlemin,"Jan 9, 2025"
7,As the title says!,"Amazingly It's taken me exactly twenty years to see my first Fast And The Furious movie and eventually I plan on watching them all.I enjoyed this more than I was expecting, so if they get better as the franchise goes along , I'm in for a treat .Los Angeles police officer Brian O'Conner must decide where his loyalty really lies when he becomes enamored with the street racing world he has been sent undercover to destroy.Having just bought a sports car myself , I found the display of cars fascinating, especially because some of them will be seen as vintage compared to today .The story itself is nothing to write home about . In fact when you think about it , it's quite ridiculous. These street racers aren't kids but they are acting like teenagers and they just happen to have 2k rolled up in their pockets to bet when they race against each other! .
The whole undercover cop thing doesn't work.It makes little sense but really that's not important because the beauty of this film is its look.It's extremely colourful and has that computer race game feel about it.I enjoyed it and I'm looking forward to the next in series .",valleyjohn,"Jun 4, 2021"
10,review,"The Fast And The Furious is one of the best movies I've ever seen, not only does it have good cars, hot women and tons of action but there is a great story line to it.  The cars in the movie kick ass I'd love just to be able to drive any one of those cars exspecially Vin Diseals car in the end of the movie, that black Charger kicked ass.",Bravezfanatic,"Jan 7, 2002"
7,"Point Break, the remake or an homage","Paul Walker playing Keanu Reeves, even down to his voice and choice of sandwich (albeit different bread); Point Break is one of my favourite films, and I really enjoy Fast and Furious but it is more or less a play by play copy of the surf-ace movie ten years on. Vin Diesel is the Bodhi-esque sensei-master surrounded by his acolytes and is convincing; it's one of his best roles (along with Pitch Black 1). He's a powerhouse. The film is attractive, stylish with a hot soundtrack and showcases the street-racer subculture in Los Angeles.Paul Walker isn't just an ersatz Reeves, he is glorious in his own right; beautiful, sexy, tough, controlled and engaging and his chemistry with Jordana Brewster (Dom Toretto's little sister) was nice, but is overshadowed by the bromance between Dom and Brian. Michelle Rodriquez is a great female foil for Diesel; she's gorgeous and convincing as a high-octane junky.Hey, F&F is never going to win awards for the most intelligent film in existence but it's pretty, amusing in places, a little cheesy and poorly dubbed but good cinema and must have had something to spawn itself into one of the largest grossing film franchises of all time. It plays like a music video, with touches of CSI in the filming but much of it is a little pointless and OTT. Vin Diesel is perfect as Dom and his chemistry with all the characters is sparkling. He plays the showman well. Paul Walker is gorgeous, he really is a loss to the acting world, and this film is his magnum opus. Walker and Diesel were obviously buddies and as such it makes this film all the more special. It's great cinema but is definitely flawed, especially in the realm of script. Don't take it too seriously, strap on your petrol-head and enjoy.",HelenMary,"Nov 28, 2015"
10,i loved it.,"This movie rocked it's the best movie I've seen ever. It also inspired me too buy a imported car too build just like the orange car.I hope there are a 2,3,4 and 5 of this movie.

6,Point Break 2,"This movie, while fast and furious, was a complete ripoff of Point Break. There were no surfboards, but the plot was the same and Paul Walker does one heck of a Keanu Reeves impression. I liked it for what it was. It was just incredibly difficult not to see the parallels and not imagine Paul Walker saying ""Woah."" All in all, not a bad summer film.",abney27,"Jul 6, 2001"
3,Hollywood movies only for brain-dead teens? Here's Exhibit A.,"This is the kind of movie that can make you think that movies are not for you.Unwaveringly juvenile and dumb.  Amateurish acting (excepting the always-riveting Vin Diesel).  Predictable as President Bush's energy policy, you'll be ahead of this movie at every dull turn.  You might think there will at least be exciting racing footage; you'd be wrong.  I wouldn't have thought it possible to make illegal street racing dull, but they have. Using skip frame and other unnecessary photographic razzle, the movie offers about as much real racing feel as a handheld video game.Skip it.",tabbycat,"Feb 22, 2002"

6,Saturday Night Fever of Its Day,"My son explained to me that he didn't exactly approve of this movie, his argument being that if you make a film about an aspect of Asian-American culture, it wouldn't hurt to put a coupla Asian-American actors in the lead roles. (There are Asians in the movie, of course, but they're bad guys.) To be honest, I have no idea if street racing is an Asian-American thing, but if my son is right, then this movie becomes the Saturday Night Fever of its day, Fever also being a movie based on a magazine article, where the subculture in question (in SNF's case, gay disco) is homogenized for mainstream consumption (goodbye, gay disco boys or Asian speed fanatics, hello Italian-Americans and Vin Diesel, who may be of unknown ethnicity but who is probably not of Asian descent). I give it a 6 on a scale of 10.",Masoo,"Feb 7, 2002"
2,The movie really stinks!,"First, the release was changed so many times which is not a good sign in most cases.  2nd, what a slow plot to develop and very weak ending.

6,"Great racing scenes, dumb crime scenes","Not a bad movie overall - some of the racing scenes, especially the first one, were truly awesome.  If they had just stuck to the racing, it would have been a great movie.  But they had to write in this really dumb crime plot involving hijacking of moving 18 wheeler trucks with little tiny Honda racecars.  I mean, what truck driver wouldn't just run over these little cars and be done with it?  Later on in the movie, motorcycles are hijacking moving cars at gunpoint.  Who in a car wouldn't just run over the motorcycles?  What reality do writers for movies like this live in?  But all in all, the racing scenes are good enough that it's probably worth seeing the movie anyways, but just be prepared to laugh at these ridiculous, needlessly complex hijacking scenes.",martinr,"Aug 6, 2001"
7,"As a car nut, the film did little for me.","Apart from seeing loads of cars and loads of women, the story line was fairly typical. Without spoiling the film, the film begins at a quick pace and really gets you going... slows a little in the middle and picks up a bit near the end. Some silly, unbelievable bits to this movie are its let downs and it has a typical character bios for the bad guy and the cop with the typical and in my opinion unbelievable relationship. Watch it for the cars and women, don't bother with the story.",phulla,"Apr 1, 2003"
10,Absolute classic,"This movie will go down as a cult classic, great cast with plenty of car action",harleyvisser,"Aug 2, 2019"
6,Good fun action movie,"I particularly like sport imports, so I had to see this movie.  The action sequences I felt were shot very well.  The story, is basically Point Break with Street racing vs. Surfing.  Cop poses as street racer, attempts to gain confidence of a Race Team, who happens to hijack big rigs with electronics equipment to fund their adrenaline rush, street racing.Some of the camera work and angle shots for the crashes are great. 
Although some may feel there was not much substance, at least you do get character feel, unlike what you could say of the other summer action movies so far this year.Worth a matinee visit, and if you like street imports, you'll probably want to own the DVD when it comes out.",kraziken,"Jun 22, 2001"
10,Great Movie,This movie was a great car racing movie. If you dont like cars or dont like to see races then dont bother seeing this movie. Everyone expects this movie to be superb and its not but its a great movie.  I suggest seeing this. I've watched this movie like 10 times and it gets better and better!,abernfich,"May 10, 2002"
6,awesome action packed film,"The Fast and the Furious was one of the best summer films i've seen in recent memory. It had intense racing scenes and a decent storyline, especially for a summer action film.I'd seen the previews for the movie at some other films i'd seen, and was really looking forward to seeing it.  It was well worth the wait.  The only real complaint i have of the movie is that the plot, though decent, could have been better.  The movie was based more on the action sequences, with the plot simply holding them together loosely.",fanoir,"Jul 9, 2001"

3,Just had to remind y'all,"The cars in this movie are nice.....but thats all. They have nothing on any of the cars in the movie Ronin. I'm not an old man (24) I'mprobably part of the ""target audience"" for this movie. I've driveninside a bad ass Japanese car and it's nice.....but thats all. I'vealso driven inside a bad ass Beamer. Comparing the two is likecomparing Britney Spears to Halle Berry ; they both look good butone is for the little boys and the other, only a man can handle.Those of you that that really do love car scenes WATCH Ronin. The speed of the cars in that movie is real. The stunt drivers are allFORMULA 1 car racers. Real driving consists of turning, not justgoing straight.

No rating,Dumb Fun,"Here's one of the goofiest movies in many a moon, but it's also damn fun. Meathead Vin Diesel and pretty boy Paul Walker shake up the underground street racing world in ""The Fast and the Furious,"" a movie that seems oh-so similar to ""Point Break,"" which is superior. But if you like fast cars and loud movies, this is the ticket. Director Ron Cohen lets it all fly here, and it pays off. Great effects and nice, loud car chases. Grab the DVD and crank it.Grade: A-",Redfoot9681,"Apr 17, 2002"
7,"Standard, but good standard","This film is really nothing mind blowing, when you consider the story, acting and stuff like that, but it is well made none the less. This could have been a TV film, hadn't it been for, well nothing really. This could have been an expensive TV film. It is just a crime story like there are hundreds out there, but the well filmed racing scenes, that keep you on the edge of your seat are well done and so is the entire film, which makes this standard car flick rise out of mediocrity.

7,"Shallow as hell, but fun to watch","If you watch The Fast and the Furious for the script and the acting, you will be disappointed. This movie has no intention of being a Michael Mann-like philosophical action movie. It's just a silly ride that will entertain for a couple of hours without any real emotional impact on the viewer. I knew this right from the start, which is why I enjoyed The Fast and the Furious.Actually, I'm being a bit unfair, since there is one respectable performance in the film: Vin Diesel's career-making portrayal of Dominic Toretto, who is the undisputed king of L.A.'s illegal street racing. That is, until a cocky guy named Brian (Paul Walker) shows up to challenge him. Naturally, Dom wins, but in the meantime he's made friends with the newcomer, who saves his life when the cops show up.As we learn soon after-wards, though, it's all a set-up: Brian is a cop himself, going undercover to find out whether Dom is involved in a series of truck hijackings.In the hands of a better director, the movie could have been an interesting character study, with the addition of a few mandatory action sequences. Rob Cohen, however, treats the script like an excuse to stage a bunch of visually spectacular race scenes. Those scenes, as well as Diesel's charismatic presence, make The Fast and the Furious fun enough to watch, but not good enough to remember. In fact, there aren't enough elements to justify the film's transformation into a franchise. But focusing on these aspects is pointless: just take the movie for what it is (a good-looking, if shallow summer blockbuster) and enjoy it. Otherwise, watch something better.7,5/10",MaxBorg89,"Nov 19, 2006"
10,Very Good Movie,"I like the story, the cars, the girls, but there is one thing that was odd about this movie and that is when the character are speaking the audio changes, it goes from loud the very low... I notice it in the theather and on the DVD... just thought that was odd. It still makes the top 10 on my list.",Dagooness,"Jan 6, 2002"
7,"Fun, Anti-critic Fun","This film series is probably the most anti-critic blockbuster franchise out there. This rating applies for the whole series, a dumb, fun romp through car culture.

Purely a dumb, fun, highly-grossing action movie.",opendomain,"Aug 4, 2020"
10,A great film for real street enthusiast.,"The Fast and The Furious is the first film to capture the actual feel and lifestyle of a group of city street racers. The plot of the film gives street racers somewhat of a bad name, but most people don't hold them in high reguards anyway. I was also happy to see the love story part of the movie take backseat to the cars and the street racers lifestyle. I gave this movie a 10, however, I believe you'll only fully appreciate this film if you are a true car enthusiast.",uofm090,"Jan 12, 2002"
6,Yes It Is,"The movie is as the title says. The plot was corny but I liked the characters, the cars, and the drag racing scenes. The music added a lot to the action sequences. The music is good all the way to the end of the credits. So stick around. Vin Diesel is always fun to watch.

Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!I have to say that I waited some crappy chase scenes, but there wasn't much of them in this movie. The chase scenes were boring and they tried to be flashy, but simply they sucked.Fast and the Furious is a big movie with nothing inside in it.

6,An entertaining no-brainer,"""Fast And The Furious"" is nothing revolutionary, even the car scenes aren't as good as I'd hoped for, but you just have to like the world these characters are living in. Fast cars equals having gorgeous women at every corner (loved the sexy Michelle Rodriguez) and dodging cops all day long.The acting's nice, the cars look good(but a far cry from great since, with the great exception of Diesel's 900 horse power monster, they all look too much alike), and the women doubly so, but the plot in this movie is just the glue that binds together. Some compare this movie to ""Point Break"". Please, the only thing they have in common is that the guy is an undercover cop that lets the ""bad guy"" go free. A good popcorn movie, nothing more.  6/10",bsinc,"Mar 17, 2003"

9,Los Angeles....GREAT sense of place,"OK, this film will not appeal to all of you....not everybody likes fast cars and smolderingly beautiful young women, which is a large part of what goes on here....But, the film is worth seeing for the wonderful location photography that captures Los Angeles and environs with brilliant clarity. Few other recent movies have given a better view and impression of Southern California. From the gritty yet palm studded industrial areas to the brilliantly clear California Desert near Palm Springs, this film has a sense of place that has rarely been equaled.

6,Good and the Bad . . .,"Ya know when you have a film that borders on A & B yet just cant quite make ups its mind? Thats my fast take on this high octane red line effort. Especially if your a youngster into the whole car group racing thing, then your gonna 'Love' this film. Yet if you look deeper to the qualities that make an all around good film, then you'll be a bit dissapointed, yet still you will be entertained. The best part about this film to me was watching for the first time, actor 'Paul Walker' Being a cross resemblance of Timothy Hutton and Rob Lowe, Paul Walker is an actor I'm keeping an eye on. Though I've never seen him, this Southern California native is no stranger to acting and will have me viewing some of his past work. The directing and some of the writing was a bit adolescent yet at times (such as during certain action/race sequences), it made good quarter mile time. No, not a waste of money, especially since finding Paul Walker, yet not a film Vin Diesel should hold up to the light. Worth the watch, worth the video rental, yet it wont be in my collection.",FilmFan777,"Jun 23, 2001"
8,Great start to the franchise,"I thought this was an excellent start to the franchise. All about family, loyalty, money and cars.

2,Boring and Shallow!,"Wow! what a horrible film. You'll be a better person if you don't watch this movie. reasons why you shouldn't watch it: -It's boring, literally boring! I fell asleep after the first 30 minutes of the movie. Even caffiene didn't help me stay awake. This is a shallow film... -The antagonists. One word to describe them; LAME! Are the chinese gang people suppose to be a threat? -No plot. Everything was random...All they do is waste time. The racing scenes were very lame. The trailers made this movie look tight...but it's NOT! -Characters. Van Deisal and Paul Walker are not even protagonists. I thought they were losers who didn't have a life! They didn't stay true to the game. Conclusion: Don't watch this film. Save your money. This film was so bad that i wanted to hit the books instead. The only credit to this film was that the racing scenes was somewhat interesting...But otherwise, this movie stunk! 2/10 stars (accurate)",sungwon444,"Jul 29, 2002"

6,Too Fast & Furious for me,"We are all tired of fast cars as a central plot, but this is where it pretty much all started. The Fast & Furious epitomizes Racing Movies. Granted, they aren't my favourite type of movies to watch, but this one really hits the nail on the head.Foolproof storyline, star studded cast (for it's time) and of course, testosterone. Fast and Furious reeks of it, but I can only take so much. Yeah sure it was moderate action but, whether this was before HD or not, the way the cars looks when traveling at super speeds were far to fake for me. It looked cheesy and the green screen was obvious. Plus the acting of some of the cast was sub-par. I mean, who would of though that putting Ja Rule in a film would be prosperous. Mediocre at rapping, what makes you think he would be auspicious for a motion picture.I can't ignore the giant pink elephant in the room so lets get right to it. Vin Diesel. The bravado that follows Diesel in ever film he appears in is present here. In one of the ending scenes where Paul Walker's character reveals something shocking, the look that was given by Dom (Vin Diesel) was chilling in every sense of the word. He definitely out shined the rest of the actors. But Johnny Tran (Rick Yune)really surprised me. He made for a very compelling antagonist and I really wish he was is in the recent Fast & Furious'. All in all, you must see this revolutionary racing film. It has it's flaws but what movie doesn't? But what do I know I'm just a 15 year old boy.~Caesar Drake",y-a-z3689,"Jan 11, 2013"
5,great action cant save a crumbling script,"Welcome to the world of street racing. Fast sleek car, hot women, and lots and lots of money. The man everyone looks to is Dominic, but he is being put under investigation by undercover cop Brian. There have been hijackers robbing trucks of their merchandise and Dominic is the main suspect. Though Brian is on the case, his judgment is clouded when he befriends Dom, but more to when he becomes infatuated by Dom's sister Mia.The Fast and the Furious is a head first trip into the world of underground street racing; but the film doesn't do it justice. It doesn't explore the notion of why people do it and just shows us that street racers are petty crimes looking for a break. The plotting is paper thin and the dialog is so hammed; they sound childish. The guys gruff their way through not showing much intelligence and the girls are given this fragile ego. All the actors try to look tuff but they don't show any sign of intimidation. The have surly looks but are giant pussy cats. They should have gotten lesson from Clint Eastwood on how to be a tough guy.Rob Cohen, though not a favourite director, does have en eye for action sequences. Most of the time his direction is very heavy handed, but when the action starts he is in his foray. The action is high energy and come at a relentless pace. He does get you right in the middle of it. Though the problem is that it doesn't keep its impact over time. Once you've seen it a few times the car chases don't really have the same intensity they had when you first saw it.It fast and has a very slick look to it, but with a script lacking development and very mediocre acting, not even the good car chases can save it from it plot holes.",nobbytatoes,"Nov 28, 2005"

7,"""I owe you a 10-second car.""","(520-word review) Film number one is in the bag; wow, there are NINE more.Everything about this was 2000s galore; the music, the outfits, the cars, the dialogue, the personalities of the characters, and the somewhat grainy/fuzzy cinematography. All of that adds to the charm, specifically the cinematography. The time-lapses and the nighttime cinematography were good.A nostalgia trip for most people, looking back. A combination of experiencing that time and this film back then. For me, it's more of an understanding (""Damn, a film that came out in 2001 is the epitome of 2000s pop culture"") than a feeling; frankly, some of it didn't land for me, particularly the constant blasting of music, both songs and the score.Throughout this film's duration, I wasn't feeling much of a story there; humble beginnings, given what the franchise develops into. You could say the same for those films, as far as not ""much of a story there"" is concerned, and that's probably accurate. More or less. Yet part of me feels the plots in those films are better. I NEED to hear the word 'family' in every line.Either way, the ramped-up outrageousness in those films likely makes up for it if that's not the case, whereas this one doesn't have that. The calm-before-the-storm/humble beginnings nature made the lackluster story stick out.The ""purpose"" behind it regarding Brian O'Conner (also, I already knew the plot twist concerning him, but I can't remember how) was lackluster; the ""real"" purpose of the overall film was undoubtedly the aesthetic. The cars and the racing: being ""cool."" And the developing camaraderie between him and Dominic Toretto, of course.In that vein, it was the best part, starting with the final heist: the development between them, especially everything after Dom learns the truth and Brian immediately goes to his place; that scene with them was well-acted by Vin Diesel and Paul Walker.That's also when the film began moving along, picking up steam. Becoming more enjoyable, as up to that point was less so. That includes the romantic angle with Brian and Mia, which was 'there.' Nothing more, nothing less. There wasn't much focus on it anyway, for some reason, and it wouldn't have made a difference if it wasn't there.My main criticism was Paul Walker's acting (although he was good-looking: his hair, in particular). While writing this, I have no idea whether people have said/are saying anything about it, particularly in this way. But yeah. His acting was mediocre until the scene with Brian and Dom at Dom's house after the final heist; his and Vin Diesel's acting in that scene was their best in the film.Acting-wise, Chad Lindberg (Jesse) was up there with Vin, and there should've been more of him. Bars. He even resembled Aaron Paul. Or not. It was more so the vibe and personality of the character that made me think of that comparison. Chad (Jesse) could've played Jesse Pinkman.As a film that's pure 2000s style and aesthetic from the music to the clothing, the Brian-Dom camaraderie held it up, complimented by the charm and action sequences.",LegendaryFang56,"Apr 19, 2023"

7,"It's Fast, It's Furious, and It's Freakin' Awesome!","The Fast and the Furious is one hell of a ride!

8,The Title Says It All,"I won't go into a long drawn out review of this film. The Fast and the Furious is just what it means. You have extremely fast sporty cars racing furiously down public streets. The plot is pretty irrelevant, but if you must know, think of this as Point Break on wheels instead of on a surf board and you'll know what I mean. Paul Walker does an admirable job in this flick, but doesn't really sell his character as an undercover cop. True..no one would ever believe he's a real cop, but even when he's acting like a cop, it's not convincing. Vin Diesel does a great job as Dominic Toretto. His deep voice and statured physic fits him perfectly for this role. This guy could be the next Arnold S. with the right script. He was sensational in Pitch Black, and just as good in The Iron Giant (voice of Iron Giant). This guy is going to go far.As for the movie, it was what I expected. Lots of fast cars, crazy chases, sexy women, and timely stunts. The plot is forgettable, but the action will be remembered. If your looking for a drama induced flick with incredible acting and a nail biting plot, you'll have to look elsewhere. But if you want fast cars, fast women and incredible chase scenes, this is the movie for you.",Blackace,"Jul 13, 2001"

7,"Simple plot, average acting but still entertains","The Fast and the Furious is an action film directed by Rob Cohen and stars Late Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Rick Yune, Chad Lindberg, Johnny Strong, and Ted Levine.The movie is first installment of fast and furious franchise.This movie is considered as one of the best movie of the franchise and i also watched the movie with lots of expectations but was subtly unsatisfied primarily due to the plot which is very simple it's execution which is straight and the acting as apart from Walker most of the characters were not up-to the mark.Plot of the movie is very simple and very predictable and will not offer you anything exciting in terms of any twists or turns but since the movie is on car races it has a fast screenplay and the viewers might not get distracted.The acting is average and apart from Paul Walker no one is that impressive, Vin Diesel was average and barring few scenes was majorly flat faced, Michelle Rodriguez had featured in few action movies and she is quite similar to another action movies she had featured in, rest of the cast were similar and acting was either average or below par. Climax of the movie is also predictableOverall the movie is quite simple with predictable story and predictable execution but still the movie doesn't disappoint and can be watched once.

No rating,Great movie for this summer & years to follow!,"I highly enjoyed this movie, enough so that I even saw it twice & am currently planning on seeing this weekend, again! The actors/actresses do an excellent job of getting into character & really making you BELIEVE they are that person. Even though I am a HUGE Paul Walker fan, I think Vin Diesel's character (Dom) was the most well-rounded & deep. Also, the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time, with all the action scenes & hott car races. If you like street racing, hott cars, fast-paced movies or fine guys, check it out.

6,Entertaining enough,"Where some people like Vin Diesel I definitely do not. Where some people like cars on high speed I do not particularly. In this kind of movies I do like action sequences brought to the screen on a certain way. And that is where the movie delivers. The plot and dialogue, the characters, the acting: it is all terrible. But the way they show us the action, especially the cars on high speed, is very good. Because this is the only thing the movie wants to do the movie is actually pretty good. If you don't like this nonsense, just don't watch it. If you do like it, you will like 'The Fast and the Furious'. You probably like the sequel even more!",rbverhoef,"Aug 3, 2003"
7,'Corona'-Virus,"I've a couple of reasons for revisiting the ""F&TF"" franchise at the moment. There's a tenth film in cinemas now, so I could do with the refresher, but also the ""How Did This Get Made"" podcast is covering them, and I try to watch the films along with them whenever I can. Though it's showing it's age in a couple of places it was actually reasonably enjoyable.Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) is an undercover police officer who infiltrates a team involved in illegal LA Street racing to try and find out who is behind a series of highly skilled thefts from trucks, whilst they are in motion. He infiltrates the team led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) but he doesn't believe that he is behind the crime, his vision though is clouded by an attraction to Toretto's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster).I was surprised about how much I actually enjoyed this. It's hilariously basic, compared to where the series ends up. Essentially, it's about stealing dvd players, that's how old the film in. There are no international terrorists, cagey CIA agents with unlimited budgets, or trips to space. There's some street racing, there's a reasonably well-planned heist and there's quite a bit of what looks like practical stunts. I was surprised about how much acting Vin Diesel does at this point in the franchise, he's warm and reasonable and doesn't just monosyllabically mumble the word ""Family"" every few minutes.It's really quite homophobic though and uses some terms that are absolutely unacceptable now. The portrayal of women is very much 'of the time', they are at best motivations for the actions and at worst literal prizes to be won or lost. The ending is a bit weak, and you wonder if they already had half an eye on the sequels by not arriving at a more definitive resolution for either of the main characters.I know there are much more exciting films to come in this franchise and a bit of a dip to come first, but I was surprised about just how watchable this one was.",southdavid,"Jun 4, 2023"

6,"Fast cars, lacklustre plot","Over the years, I ignored the hype about the Fast and the Furious franchise, until the 7th film came out and I thought to myself that it's about time I got caught up with the series. So I went back to the original Fast and the Furious from 2001, which I originally catch glimpses of when I was 8 years old, but I remember the plot being too complicated for me to follow so I didn't enjoy it as much.The Fast and the Furious lives up to its namesake. Fast cars and furious action that has spurred the cult following for the past 14 years. Aside from the souped-up cars and racing scenes with no seemingly no real purpose, the plot is dry with many loopholes. This film is not for the serious and critical movie goer, it is the typical man movie. I can see why it has earned itself such a following over the years, but this movie wasn't my cup of tea. I've been told the 2nd movie is a lot better, so I remain hopeful.",hoxjennifer,"Jun 14, 2015"

I really like street racing movie just like Fast Furious 1 and FF tokyo drift... Fast Furious 1 IMO is the best from all FF movies so far... The storyline is good... Acting was superb....

6,Would recommend,"2 fast 2 furious can be a bit of an uneven movie. While it's fair share of short comings, they are ultimately pretty easy to look over while watching this film. The fast cars and the enjoyable/likable cast make this movie a thrill to watch. Some of the lines are a little wacky and kinda childish but it's still pretty darn quotable even today. Overall, the movie will probably most enjoyable to an older crowd from around the time this came out and people who like cars/street racing. It's a good movie to put on with some friends and have a good time with its absurd action filled goodness. Would recommend.",tammiea-48100,"Feb 4, 2023"
5,So bad it's hilarious,"""The Fast and the Furious"" is probably the best comedy of 2001. An impressive feat, considering it isn't supposed to be a comedy.Somewhere amongst all the ridiculous looking fluorescent sports cars (are these things really supposed to be ""cool""?), the inane dialogue,  the annoying music, and Paul Walker (that guy can't act his way out of a wet paper bag) we get a plot that's a complete rip-off of ""Point Break"" and racing scenes that are laughably overdone and NOT INTERESTING.Another irritating part for me (being a car nut) is the sheer ignorance of cars and of car tuning displayed in this mess. Here are a few of the things I ""learned"" from this movie:*Mazda RX-7s have six cylinder engines with overhead cams*Nitrous oxide is volatile*NOS is an acronym, and should be pronounced ""NAWWWS""*A 10 second Toyota Supra will have difficulty outrunning a 13 second Ferrari 355 but will have no trouble whatsoever keeping up with a 9 second Dodge Charger*Nitrous can ""blow the welds off"" of an intake*Mitsubishi Eclipses have 7-speed transmissions*It's possible to invest $100,000 into the engine of a Honda S2000 without putting a jet engine in it*Experienced drag racers are afraid of 9 second carsI could really go on forever, but this is just a small sampling. Maybe this film is funniest to someone with car experience, but any bad movie buff is sure to find something to love in it.1/10 (in terms of cinematic quality) 5/10 (in terms of ""Ed Wood"" quality)",Apollyon_Crash,"Dec 19, 2003"
8,Great Movie,"There are already a lot of comments here, so I'll keep it short, but everyone either says it sucks or it was good when you don't worry about the plot.  I went to see ""The Fast and the Furious"" with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised.  It was a magnificent movie with unquestionably fantastic special effects and stunning realism.  True if you are an actual street racer, you may see a few flaws in the realism (as happens with any movie about any non-publicized culture), but for the rest of us, it is a much needed improvement on movies like ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" (I still hate that part where Nick Cage outruns the helicopter).There is truth to the statement that this movie is very similar to ""Point Break"", though I did not notice it until it was pointed out in this site. It still has great acting and great action, not to mention a cohesive plot. I challenge those who disliked this movie to find a better action movie released this year. This is one of my new favorite movies.",Mr Nuff,"Jul 12, 2001"
7,"Fast 1: This could be good, right?","So, this is obviously a Point Break inspired film about a straight laced ""cop"" going out to arrest a group of rebellious, extreme sports people only to be tempted by their groovy voodoo until he becomes one of them.

2,"Oh, I saw this movie already.

This movie is a retreat of Point Break, the really bad actioner from 1991 (?) in which Keanu Reeves plays a fed who goes undercover to break a string of robberies connected with a gang of surfers. Okay. so you substitute the fed for a Cop, and then you take it from surfing to street racing. what you have is pretty faces, action, bad dialogue, bad acting, and just plain bad movies. Poing Break at least is the best bad movie of all time. it's so bad, that it becomes good. the way i see it is that movies are to some people, a flat world. but i'm columbus. i see a round world, in which one can go so far East (bad) that you can come around the other end on the west (good) side. This movie reaches new heights in bad-dom. And what's with Ja Rule in this movie. no wonder rap hasn't been good in a decade, they're all too busy rapping about the same old subjects and appearing in movies.

6,"Yeah, it's funny how that works out.","The plot is similar to the 1991 cult classic Point Break. The backstories are scattered, and filled with over-the-top racing sequences and action scenes. This film feels like a standalone; at the time, they didn't seem to be thinking about a sequel. The background music fails to make an impact and is often noisy and distracting on many occasions. Some scenes, like hijacking a truck with Honda Civics to steal VHS players, feel illogical and foolish. The investigator's office scenes are boring and annoying due to poor acting and dialogue.Walker and Diesel give average performances, bouncing off one another but unable to convey a deeper emotional level. Rodriguez is particularly bad with her constant frowning and poor one-liners, while Brewster delivers a decent performance.

3,"Fast cars, furious action, comatose plot","""The Fast and The Furious,"" directed by Rob Cohen and based on a magazine article about street racing, was undoubtedly one of the ""in"" movies during the summer of 2001, grossing over $140 million.To label it a ""surprise hit"" was erroneous. ""Furious"" was going to succeed no matter what, because, to put it bluntly, it was a dual-gratification film. The girls were aroused at its pretty-boy hunk stars, and the guys likewise at the four-wheeled penile extensions  I mean the gaudy, overgarnished import cars.And after finally seeing it almost a year later, I wholeheartedly agree that it was ""in,"" all right: inept, inane, insipid, and inferior.The plot has undercover cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) infiltrating a street-racing gang suspected of stealing and fencing electronic equipment. They spend the money on modifications to their rice burners, such as blowing $10,000 on speed-increasing nitrous oxide tanks. As Brian is accepted into the criminal fraternity by the gang leader, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), he also finds himself falling for Dom's sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster). Sure enough  you guessed it  Brian is increasingly hesitant to apprehend Dom for the thefts as their friendship grows over time. It sounds just as bad as it plays.I knew the script for ""Furious"" would be embarrassing, considering that it plays second banana to moving hunks of glass and steel, and I wasn't disappointed. I've read better dialogue on a cereal box. I mean, how can you beat lines like ""Damn, that guy's fast!"" and ""Hey, bro, you got a bathroom?""It's obvious the male leads were cast for their looks. Beach bum-looking Walker is hardly believable as a police officer or a street racer. Most of his close-ups show him staring at his co-stars with a blank half-grin. His attempt at sounding cool consists of, ""Check it out, it's like this."" If he wins the film's opening race, then he'll ""get the money and the respect."" (A telltale sign that he's a cop: he's the only driver in the entire movie who bothers to wear a seatbelt.)I must've been on another planet when it was decided that Diesel was the next big star in the making. Whatever the case may be, his popularity certainly isn't due to his acting. Here, he is emotionless when speaking lines that don't require him to scream, and as a result he sounds like he's reading off a teleprompter. He is victimized by poor dialogue as much as Walker; at one point, when Dom wistfully says to Brian, ""I live my life a quarter mile at a time,"" I wanted to spray the screen with Airwick.Early in the film, Dom and his buddies refer to Brian as ""the buster."" Does anyone even use that term anymore?Incredibly enough, both Walker and Diesel are outdone by Michelle Rodriguez in her unintentionally hysterical role of Dom's girlfriend. She performs the most grueling duty of the picture: standing around for ninety minutes with a permanent pout on her face. Then again, if I had lines like ""Why don't you skate before I leave treadmarks on your face?"" my lower lip would be protruding like a diving platform.Save for Brewster as Mia, the script prevents viewers from sympathizing with the poorly developed characters. As a result, any expressions of sentimentality come off as artificial. We don't feel sorry for characters who get shot at while stuck on an 18-wheeler, suffer a horrific car crash, or are gunned down in a drive-by shooting.The other type of race figures prominently in ""Furious,"" and the script gives it the finger by playing up stereotypes to the hilt. All the Mexican men wear khaki shorts and tall socks; one cracks racist jokes and ""has a last name but can't pronounce it."" Dom and Brian are harassed by motorcycle-riding, machine gun-toting Asians led by Johnny Tran (Rick Yune). Meanwhile, the Black crowd is so well-represented by Ja Rule in a spellbinding performance. (If you couldn't sense the sarcasm here, then you shouldn't be reading this.) When he talks, he sounds like he needs a Breathe-Right strip. Not surprisingly, he is the source of the film's only ""F"" word during his mercifully brief screen time.Big shock  the women are portrayed as nothing more than scantily-clad armpieces in short skirts. Their sole purpose is to stand around while the cameras pan up from their ankles. The extras at the first race all cheer and jeer right on cue like Pavlov's dogs as Dom rambles about car parts. Perhaps they were amazed at his usage of big words.However, not everything is the fault of the actors. Much of ""Furious"" is just outright nonsense.For starters, I've hardly ever seen any cars that are covered in all those psychedelic graphics. The race and chase sequences suffer greatly at the hands of a combination of choppy editing and an overbearing rap soundtrack. Plus, what part of Los Angeles is deserted both day and night, and where does such a huge stretch of road exist on which four cars can race side-by-side while going over 140 miles an hour (that's over two miles per minute; I doubt that nearly eight miles of a city street can be illegally blocked off by spectators)? Are there always so many lead changes in such a short race? How can the characters afford these cars? Can someone go flipping and flying about in a '69 Charger, crash and then walk away with barely a scratch? How can Brian burn out his engine after hitting 140 and then drive away an instant later, or take his eyes off the road for long stretches of time during a race in order to operate not one, but two laptop computers?If I was a cop who was incompetent enough to let my prime suspect get away (""I owe you a ten-second car,"" Brian tells Dom before forking over the keys), my career would soon be in cinders after I was terminated for assisting in a criminal's escape.""The Fast and The Furious"" would have fared better had the script been as eye-popping as the cars. This movie does remain true to the essence of its subject matter in one aspect: it's one hell of a drag. 3/10",SwingBatta,"Feb 27, 2002"
10,BRILLIANT,Words cannot express how much I love the Fast and Furious saga. To kick it off like this is just amazing. Fast and Furious is always been a comfort film when you can always put on and watch and safe to say I know probably half the script of each movie,miacoop,"Jan 11, 2021"
6,Dumb- and proud!,"The Fast and The Furious is one of the most unapologetically stupid movies to come along in a while.  It's about a bunch of drag racers, but really, it's all about the drag racing itself.  The filmmakers know this, so they spent all their time on that stuff, and basically ignored usually important elements like plot, conflict, and dialogue.  The result is a movie that is extremely watchable, but nevertheless very, very dumb.If you care about plot, you obviously are thinking too hard at this movie. Still, TF&TF is about a few drag racers, led by Turetto (Vin Diesel), who gets mixed up with new kid on the block Brian (Paul Walker).  We quickly learn Brian's a cop, looking for some guys who rip off semi trucks while they are driving.  Anyway, by the end of the movie the film is so wrapped up in thrills and big explosions and things smashing into one another, it basically gives up on the plot, doesn't bother resolving several of the conflicts (Including Brian's weird love interest with Turetto's sister).The acting and dialogue are truly laughably bad.  When Vin Diesel says a line like ""I live my life a quarter mile at a time...for those ten seconds or less, I'm free."" I certainly laugh-how does he keep a straight face? These are lines that porn actors would have trouble delivering straight! Diesel is ideal for this role; he's physically intimidating (Paul Walker looks downright wussy next to him) and his no-emotion acting style really allows him to say stuff that other actors might actually think about when they delivered them and realize just how stupid they were going to sound.Still, the racing stuff is very exciting, and a heist involving an angry truck driver is truly thrilling (Even though I didn't care one iota about who lived or who died).  Even though there's a big plot hole in that scene, it'll be hours before you realize it.  The conclusion is exciting AND humorous; yet makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  This film is in-the-moment enjoyable, groan-worthy in retrospect.Rob Cohen, director of the atrocious Daylight, and the slightly-less-atrocious, but still-pretty-horrible The Skulls, is a little better here, wisely avoiding to bathe all his pretty characters in golden halos of backlight and instead going for a much more realistic look.  He's probably aided by the exciting material not the other way around.  I'm still not convinced he's a good director.Anyway, sad to say, I enjoyed this movie far more than just about any other action movie this summer...as lame as it is, it stays fairly enjoyable throughout.  In a lot of places, the car-chase free parts stay fun cause the people talking sound so completely stupid.  I laughed, I was entertained, I wished there were more movies out like Memento.",Mr. Pulse,"Jun 30, 2001"
5,Fast Cars And Those Who Drive Them,"I had just come from a rather desultory day at the movies where I saw the sequel Fast & Furious to this film. I had written in the review that you probably would have had to see the first film in order to fully appreciate what was going on. Wouldn't you know it, the FX channel was broadcasting this tonight. I was partially correct, but this film had a bit more plot to it and didn't concentrate on just the special effects and the violence which was served up fast and furious. Vin Diesel is a criminal who races cars as an avocation and does hijackings for a living. The FBI wants him, the LAPD wants him and Paul Walker is an LAPD cop gone undercover to get him.Walker takes his assignment quite literally and part of getting undercover is under some blankets with Diesel's sister Jordana Brewster and getting it on with the young lady. But he also proves his driving abilities to Diesel.Diesel's racing rivals are some Asian gangbangers headed by Rick Yune and Walker would dearly like to pin something on them. Still it's Diesel his superiors want and it's Diesel they will have come what may.Paul Walker compromised his effectiveness as an undercover agent thoroughly in this film. In fact at the beginning of the sequel it is remarked that he's lucky to still be holding a job. Makes for some rather unbelievable viewing.But fans of fast cars and those who drive them will definitely like The Fast And The Furious.",bkoganbing,"Apr 9, 2009"
No rating,Excellent,"Honestly, I was expecting a B movie, but I was blown away by the Fast and the Furious. The film is fast paced and exciting all the way through. The actors are young and beautiful and play their parts with such angst and innocence that you really feel for them (you don't cry for them or anything). The car scenes are fantastic. The fast cuts, the real stunts, the beautiful cars, the humming of the engines... everything was assembled to recreate an intense atmosphere. On my drive home from the screening I was revving up my engine, accelerating only to slow down, and truly enjoying my five speed manual. What was nice about The Fast and the Furious was that even though people are gunned down by machine guns, the film had a very G rated feel to it. There is no gratuitous sex, no over the top violence, no crazy unexpected explosions... and no superfluous CGI. What I like to call a movie that is somewhat true to reality. And these kinds of films are a pleasure to watch because you can slip in and out of them with ease. Granted I love fast driving and this movie hit the spot.",lissandra,"Jun 15, 2001"
6,A Thrilling Ride with Limitations,"The Fast and the Furious (2001) is a high-octane action film that kicks off one of Hollywood's most successful franchises. The movie delivers on its promise of fast cars, intense street racing, and adrenaline-pumping action, creating an electrifying experience for fans of the genre. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker have undeniable chemistry as the leads, with Diesel's commanding presence and Walker's relatability balancing the dynamic. The film's underground car culture is portrayed with a certain charm, and the high-speed races are thrilling, providing a lot of visual excitement.However, while the film succeeds in its action and visual appeal, its plot and character development feel somewhat underwhelming. The story, centered around an undercover cop infiltrating a group of street racers, feels predictable and clichéd at times. The dialogue can be cheesy, and some of the supporting characters lack depth, relying more on stereotypes than fully fleshed-out personalities. The film's pacing can also drag in moments where it focuses on non-racing action or exposition.The Fast and the Furious is undeniably entertaining, but it's not without its flaws. It serves up plenty of fun for fans of high-speed action, but those looking for more substance or sophisticated storytelling might find themselves wanting more. Still, it laid the foundation for a beloved franchise that would eventually grow into a much grander, globe-trotting saga.",fahimrcs,"Jan 17, 2025"
6,cool cast and cars,The cars and the cast were cool but the story and script were a little juvenile.  Had cool cinematography.. You really felt the speed in the racing sequences.  Would have been better with a more intelligent story and script. Almost gave it 5 stars but the cars were cool so 6.,spond77,"Jan 21, 2002"
8,Wow !,"Just watched that movie ! I found it impressive ! Sound, picture and its fast-pace really where overwhelming. O.K. the story is not really smart but that is compensated by a nearly constant stream of thrill. Music fits perfectly to the pictures making you sometimes think you are just watching an expensive video on MTV ! Even if you are one of those persons that doesn't like cars, this movie will grab your attention  and won't let go until the end !",twelp,"May 17, 2002"

10,A Great car film starring tough guys and chicks,This film is the best car movie it has action romance and violence!! I know critics are hating this film this is the first in the series I love how Paul walker is a police or fbi to stop toretto but then becomes friends with him vin diesel put his soul in this movie to give u his best performance!!! So give him respect!!! And then Paul walker turns to street racing and stops being a cop then we go on that story line of Paul trying to turn against the FBI and then they bust the Chinese racers then it's just somewhat of a mess but hey it will entertain a 12 to 13 year old anyway!!!,bethlori,"Apr 22, 2021"
6,"Point Break 2 : Less surfing, more cars","This is an 'okay' film, the acting is 'okay', the script is 'okay', the direction is 'okay' and so on. At no point does it ever threaten to become exciting, but neither does it ever try putting you to sleep. So it's definitely another movie from Rob Cohen.The main problem is that this is a virtual retread (ahem) of the far superior 'Point Break'. The plot? An undercover cop gets involved with a group of fast-living criminals and finds himself with divided loyalties thanks to a beautiful woman. If you've seen 'Point Break' you'll be constantly comparing the two and finding the older movie to be far superior.'Point Break' was well structured, there was a constant pull on the central character, dragging him into the criminal gang until he found himself deeply and inextricably caught up in their activities. Whereas 'The Fast and the Furious''s Officer O'Connor is even more gung-ho than the bad guys. Who can care what happens to the good guy if he wants to be the baddie?It's also lazily directed. 'Point Break' left your heart pounding with its chase scenes or the incomparable parachute drop. Here, there is little that hasn't been seen before and done better. The first car race does work well, but the climactic car chase is far too long, not at all well edited, and falls flat. Likewise it fails to utilise the locations. If you travel through nighttime LA, you see something between a dream and an industrial nightmare - here it is a few neon lit streets that could have been anywhere. What a waste of a great location.Finally the movie has a lazy ending which appears to have been lifted directly from 'Point Break', the cop who is friends with the master criminal in one final confrontation. Except that this time it is a gutless ending which stinks of pandering to focus groups.In its defence, 'The Fast and the Furious' has two great points, the cars and Vin Diesel. The cars - well they are astonishing beasts and lovingly shot, Vin Diesel, once again has real presence on-screen and exudes menace. He is definitely bound for greater things, perhaps even a role where he can exercise his acting?If Summer 2001 had been a normal movie year, 'The Fast and the Furious' would have done respectable box-office and then sunk without trace. With precious little competition it has done far better than expected, but that says more about the other movies than this one.All in all, it's strange that a movie that revolves around cars doesn't appear to be firing on all cylinders.",mikerichards,"Sep 17, 2001"
1,"Car Stunts, Car Stunts, Nothing Else","If you want to see lots of Car Stunts and are a Petrol Head then this is a great movie, for the rest of us the lack of plot, dialogue, and character formation makes for poor viewing.A blokes buddy film with lots of fast cars and nothing else.",wiztwas,"Aug 2, 2001"
8,A very great start,"Always the first part in movies very cool. I liked this version, in terms of the story and acting performance. Rob Cohen brought us a great movie. Thank you, so give this 8/10.",tamerhaddou-70008,"May 22, 2021"
6,Who needs good writing when you have fast cars and big crashes??,"Depending on the age group you fall under, you may or may not like this movie. But then again, that's true of a lot of movies but this one seemed to have a very specific target audience and it seemed to be between the ages of 17 to 23 and predominately male. I fall outside of this age group but it doesn't mean a bad reviewit just means that it's not going to be a good review either. Well, it might. I guess you'll just have to read to the end of the review to find out. Typically movies aimed at this target audience tend to be high on the stunts and low on just about everything.Fast and Furious is about cars. Fast cars to be specific. And not the type that belongs on the race track but the kind that gets you arrested for going a zillion miles an hour down a city street in the middle of the night. This movie is about a young man that enters the underground life of street racing. Something that happens in every city. But apparently this past time is rather cliquish and getting in with the `in-crowd' isn't always easy nor does everyone accept you. It's not that different than belonging to a gang it seems. Get in with one group and you're the enemy of another group, which means that you're going to have the typical `turf war' issues. You're also going to have your `boy meets sister of big bad brother' side story and all the other issues that go along with it. There's a bit of a twist but nothing that I haven't seen in other gang/drug related movies that have something to do with young people. In fact this movie reminded me a lot of `Point Break' except I enjoyed that movie.If it sounds like I'm not really all that enthused about the plot line it's because I'm not. There was really nothing that was too terribly original about the storyline. In fact, if you look at the trailers, you'd think this movie was based on the video game `Need for Speed'. The colors used and the cars involved could have easily come out of that game and the characters? Definitely could have been taken out of a video game. The writing was full of clichés and the delivery of them wasn't overly well done. At some points I thought to myself `Did he actually say that?? That's so cheesy!' or `Please don't say that next line, please, please, please!' but they did. Not enough time was spent on developing the relationships we see. We're just kind of told about them but not in a way that really enlightens us, just that this relationship exists so accept it. So far this review is sounding pretty negative isn't it? Well, I have to say that the stunts were kind of interesting. The car chase scenes (and there's a lot of them) were pretty well done and some of the scenes they do with the semi-trucks were interesting but not all that believable.
So you're wondering, is there anything worth seeing about this movie? Hmmm, maybe depending on if you fit that target group I was talking about. If you have a hot car and like to see some hot cars with neat toys and some street racing, then this movie's for you. Other than that, I wouldn't really see it. The dialogue alone would make you want to get pulled over for road rage.",Rhino Rover,"Jul 26, 2001"
1,The Moronic & Ridiculous,"This move was so dumb I don't even know where to begin. Put next to this, films ""Stone Cold"", ""Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man"", and ""Road House"" look like cinematic masterpieces. If only it were true that you could roll a car 12 times at 100 miles per hour and come out with hardly a scratch. Granted there are some outstanding stunts, but not enough action overall to offset the non-sense plot and 3rd rate acting. Don't get me wrong I consider Vin Diesel a pretty good actor, but the script sounds like it was written for (or perhaps by) 8 year olds. Vin, your talents were wasted buddy.

7,The Fast and the Furious,Overall Rating 6.8: The Fast and the Furious is a good enough film with plenty of cool cars and likeable characters.

8,Fast Paced action,"The one that started it all, The original Fast and the Furious is a movie that I think is often forgotten. Fans and casual viewers alike think of the extremely over the top impossible action sequences the newer Furious movies have become. But few remember that once upon a time, it was about street racing and boosting trucks.While it is essentially a Point Break remake with cars instead of surfers, the Fast and the Furious manages to stand on its own and be a thoroughly entertaining movie. The dialogue is pretty stupid at times and some stuff that happens doesn't always make sense, but the movie never fails to entertain.The Fast and the Furious is probably too good to be considered a guilty pleasure, but too bad to be considered a great movie, so I'll just say, even if it's stupid at times, and over the top, The Fast and The Furious is without a doubt a very entertaining movie I really enjoy watching every once in a while.",schroeder-gustavo,"Sep 21, 2015"
6,It could be very good,"I was attracted to the movie by its unexpectedly strong box office score and the fact that I was a hard core street racer some years back.The excellent: I would rate the street racing scenes are among the best of all times. The needed improvement: The technology stuffs are too domestic and simple. I don't see other countries' street racers (Japanese, Europeans...) using nitros and decide a driver's ability on a straight line race but the states. If they can make the races from point A to B (non-straight line) and focus more on how handling tuning is as important as horsepower, the ability of the 'well respected' group leader and the undercover would become more persuasive. Conclusion: If you are a hard core racing fan, this movie could disappoint as it did to me. The movie plot is really poor.",ntam,"Dec 24, 2001"

7,Where's the American Hotrod v-8?,"Ok i have to give this movie some credit, the story was (i thought) interesting. However I found it odd that near the end they tried to create pity for the characters who were breaking the law, and the antagonist to the main character. But what fantasy city is this where there are a bunch of 4 cylinders that gather and no 8cyl car for miles??? The main character drove a Supercharged lightning and races in a crappy 4 cyl. I think that the creators of this movie forgot that the the world record for acceleration is held by a v-8. Of course there was 1 mean car in the movie, but... the first time you see it run, well you'll just have to see just what happens for your self. Anyway if you want to see better than decent film with an interesting story, then see this movie. If you like ""FAST"" cars then go to a local race track.",rodmunch1988,"Sep 19, 2001"

9,Loved it!,"This movie is adrenalin charged from the very beginning.  The plot centres around an undercover cop,Brian, who has to investigate a number of hijacks. To do this, he must get to know the chief suspect, Dominic Torretto (a stellar performance by the magnificent Vin Diesel) and his group of street racers who buy Japanese cars and spend thousands of dollars converting them into racing machines.  As well as being a street racer, Dom also runs a store and a garage.  His gang includes his girlfriend Lettie, younger sister Mia and friends Vince, Leon and Jessie.  Brian is drawn deeper into the glamourous world, falling for Mia and discovering a respect for Dom, which conflicts with his objectivity.Rob Cohen does an amazing job of directing this movie, even making a Hitchcock-esque cameo as a pizza delivery guy.  The film is very well acted, particularly by Vin Diesel, who manages to portray the two sided character of the carefree street-racer with the responsible older brother who looks out for Mia and the rest of his team.  His performance is by far the best of the entire film.  Apparently the character of Lettie was not in the original story and unfortunately this shows.  Michelle Rodriguez pouts and sneers her way through the film, and her character has no real depth.  This is the only low point in a truly brilliant film.",stephie-12,"Feb 22, 2004"
6,"Big, dumb, fast and fun","Big dumb fast and fun.I was talking with a friend of mine who is into customizing cars  - he has a gorgeous Honda Accord that has a new addition every time I see him - when I saw the first trailers for this movie.  We agreed that there would be some great cars, gorgeous women, awesome racing sequences and people condemning the film for irresponsibly promoting street racing.  All our suspicions proved correct, but most surprising was the lateness of the negative publicity for the film - I didn't see an article until today (interesting side note, the author had been cruising the international custom car bulletin boards for weeks trying to get interviews, but no one would bite). 
Blond haired blue-eyed Brian Spindler is sent to find the people responsible for several precision big rig hijackings.  He searches for his quarry among the street racing gangs of LA, where he meets and tries to ingratiate himself with Dominic Torreto, the prince of the racing set.  Brian soon finds himself in the middle of a bubbling gang war, and is being pressured by his superiors to get a bust. Things get complicated when Brian finds himself falling for Dominic's sister and at odds with the other members of Dom's crew.  But just when he thinks things can't get any worse, Brian gets an unpleasant surprise.I'm not going to rave about an intricate plot, zippy well scripted dialogue or in-depth character studies, because they simply aren't present, indeed there are several laughingly bad lines, and the acting is generally subpar This film is about action, and the sequences are some of the best to grace the movie screen  in a long time:  the driving is phenomenal, that stunts are amazing (no digital enhancement here) and the cars are very impressive. Although the film is a little over the top in some aspects - not every car customizer uses Nitrous Oxide or races their cars (most would be terrified that they might scratch or god forbid crash, their cars)- I think they have managed to capture the spirit of this unique subculture.   The acting is definitely a mixed bag.I've enjoyed Vin Diesel's roles, even though I've not been that enamoured of the films he's been in.  In a recent interview, he explained that he's drawn to anti-heroes as he finds them more interesting than the white shirted good guys, and I tend to agree with his observations.  As Diesel recently stated, Dominic is a man of his word, who believes in honor, but happens to ""live outside the law"" and his is the only character that is adequately fleshed out in the film.   Paul Walker plays Brian as possibly the most inept undercover cop to grace the screen - the only way he could stand out more in the group he's trying to infiltrate would be to wear a Village People costume.  Donnie Brasco he ain't.   This is exacerbated by the fact that Walker's portrayal is virtually bereft of any real emotion, and his soulless delivery of several corny lines renders them even worse than they were written- quite a feat.  The biggest disappointment for me was the waste of Michelle  Rodriguez - who distinguished herself in ""Girl Fight"" - whose soul purpose is to linger on screen and scowl.  A tremendous waste of a valuable commodity.If you're looking for a punchy matinee, without a lot of dialogue or plot to get in the way, settle in for the ride.",Shiva-11,"Jun 23, 2001"
10,The start of it all,"Fast and Furious. The first one. This film came out a month before I was born, and I've only just watched now in 2018. Do I like it? Does it hold up? Let me explain.
Ever since I can remember, I've been into cars. Always have, always will be. Now, when Hollywood tries to make a film about car culture, did they get it right? Sort of.
This movie has so much good about it. The story is just solid. Car guys and girls just being themselves, sticking together. Lets you know a bit of what its like to have a crew. All the cars are iconic. Dom's Black Dodge Charger and Red Mazda RX-7, Brian's Orange Toyota Supra and Green Mitsubishi Eclipse. So many other cars that back in the day and even today look absurd with the styling and parts, but are classics because of the movies that made them. And this movie started all of it. You can't talk about tuner culture or drag racing or even Paul Walker without bringing this film up. This film had its rough spots, but those imperfections are what make this film so iconic and loved.
So, did Hollywood make a car film true to the culture? It's 50/50. They got the racing and the tuning and the whole feel of the scene, but also added in the heists and back turning that is so classic Hollywood. This film is classic, and still means something to me today.",jackfull,"Nov 19, 2018"
6,Style Over Substance Only Gets You So Far,"Pretty cars, pretty people, loud music, lots of stunts fights and races. The performances are ok if fairly limited in range and the dialog swings from adequate to embarrassing.If this is all your looking for in your cinematic experience it can certainly be entertaining. But I would prefer less cliches and some actual character development.The writing is pretty straightforward, and cliched, and the plot is far from original - though it does admittedly have a little more style and attitude.The big racing event which the characters attend is unfortunately named race wars.Obviously despite its shortcomings the film made over $200 Million and spawned a franchise - so what do know.",gpeevers,"Feb 13, 2024"

The average joe will watch this and enjoy because the average joe likes Hondas with NOS and pink neon. I cant stand to see the the tuner culture exposed in such a way that glorifies the idea of throwing tons of cash into cars with little to no potential. This film grossly augments the ability of a V-TEC and NOS. Yeah, okay this film was not supposed to be realistic but it is so ridiculous that I can't even pretend to enjoy. The plot is this: an undercover cop tries to bust a theft ring by entering the underworld of compact car racing. The cop meets people, races, and tries to look cool... it is horrible to watch...painful. The plot is ho-hum the acting is humorous and the races are bullcrap. At one point there is a supra that races a Ferrari...and wins. like I said before this is too ridiculous to praise.

No rating,The car's the star in this mediocre effort,"THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS **Action aficionados look out, because if you want a movie with limited plot to get in the way of some rip roaring cars then this is the film for you. Succinctly put, Paul Walker plays a cop who has to go undercover to infiltrate a gang of illegal car racers and must get into their circle of friends to find out their illegal activities.  Diesel is the leader of such a group and together they become friends.  A moral dilemma story; I think not.  What you get is an excuse to see the fastest turbo boosted cars on the market with some feisty women to boot.  Some sequences may get the blood pumping and the constant bumping soundtrack will leave you thinking that you've just participated in such an illegal street race yourself. 
The acting is wooden and Diesel just portrays...well Diesel.  He stands there looking angry and mean and doesn't really do anything.  There's a love story to boot, but the emphasis is firmly on the street races and how, rather unfairly, they can easily avoid the dumb police who seem intent in every movie in crashing into each other and generally looking foolish in pursuit of criminals.",CCS-CRITIC,"Nov 13, 2003"

So, this movie unique and brutal asset is the adrenaline-pumping action scenes, which teach ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"" a harsh lesson in emotion.

7,Definitely fast but dunno about the furious part,"This movie rocked in some senses but then I think the ending was abrupt and predictable. Paul Walker and Vin Diesel work well as a team, despite Dom's attitude to the others but the friendship seemed a lot more geunine. Letty was a kewl character, they should have explored it more though. Mia was just another female added in to make Brian's character well a man off course.

The story line is new and interesting and it is very entertaining in my opinion the actors just ruin it though. Paul Walker and Vin desiel can not act at all so everything seems so fake and unbelievable just because of them.This movie is about an undercover cop who goes undercover to infiltrate an underground street racing ring. Though as his friendships with these people grow closer and closer he slips from being a cop to being a criminal.This movie was still pretty good even despite the robot like acting of walker and deseil.

3,"Shallow movie about hot cars and girls - big problem: they get the ""cars"" part completely wrong!","OK, I get it, the movie is only to show hot cars and girls, so I won't comment on the thin, improbable and hole-riddled plot. Instead I'm going to list just a few thing that are wrong about the cars in the movie, which I'm guessing was designed for viewers who largely have no clue about cars, maybe because the target audience is slightly too young to drive, i.e. early teens? Well, here goes: 1. NOS seems to be the solution to everything. There is a lot more involved to make a car go fast, yet the shop is full of NOS, NOS, and more NOS parts! Oh, and exhausts, because everyone knows loud exhausts are the 2nd most important thing that makes a car go fast ;-) 2. The car ""tops out at 140"", let's add some NOS (surprise!) and it'll go faster. If your car tops out at 140, NOS will not help you one bit. Maybe you're running out of gears, maybe the engine should be built for higher revs, but NOS won't change anything about your top speed! 3. The best qualities of the type of cars driven, modern Japanese cars, are cornering and handling. What do they do? They have a drag race on a straight instead - wrong car for this purpose, any average US muscle car will beat the hell out of the Jappa there with less money spent on it (and conversely, a modern Japanese car will leave an average old US muscle car in the dust in an actual race involving lots of corners).4. Double-clutching ... oh dear, what a complete and utter nonsense! You double-clutch if you have an unsynchronized transmission - very unlikely - and even then only when you down-shift (which you never do in a drag race!) 5. 140mph is fast at the end of a quarter mile, but not that fast in principle, there are *many* European and Japanese cars that have a top speed around that figure or higher, even ""family cars"".6. Nitrous oxide doesn't run out after a few seconds (lines in the movie indicate a racer has used his NOS boost ""too early"").7. If Vin is serious about drag racing, he wouldn't have a sound system weighing a ton in his car. Note, there's a scene where the geek is explaining how to save 2-3kg of weight on the car they're building later on, so on the other hand they do seem to be interested in saving weight.8. Towards the end, Vin drives the Charger and does a monstrous wheelie. You don't get that kind of traction/wheelie on anything but big fat racing slicks, yet the car has pretty normal tires on it.9. While we're at it - the tires are smoking while he does a wheelie?! Wheelie means you have grip. Smoking tires means you don't have grip. Which is it?!? 10. A car like that Charger would definitely have a wheelie bar, especially since a wheelie as big and exaggerated as the one shown in the movie would just cost you time.11. If you're serious about 1/4 mile times, you're not going to drive a FWD car, but rather a RWD or 4WD car.12. Surely even the boy-racer scene with Jappa cars finds cheap stickers tacky (no pun intended) and would opt for real airbrush or pin-striping on their prized cars (there is one scene where they put decorative stickers(!) on a car).13. Why would you rebuild a burnt out Supra?! Apparently their labor is free and restoring the car is done in a leisurely afternoon or something. Oh, and the engine is so special that $15k turns it into a 10s car! These are just off the top of my head, and I'm not even that knowledgeable about cars myself, so I'm sure there's plenty more wrong. The movie doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't, but at least they should have gotten the ""car"" parts right in what is meant to be a car movie! ...or did I get that wrong and I just watched a very long commercial for NOS (which is a brand name ;-) ?",nichtssagend,"May 29, 2011"
10,"""The Fast and the Furious"" is One Hell of a Thrill Ride!","I've seen a compilation of the 1st-6th movies of the ""The Fast and the Furious"" film franchise and seeing ""Furious 7"" trailer on Youtube, and I think they're very great movies. Instead of seeing ""Furious 7"" on April, I decided to watch the earlier films and just catch up to the seventh movie. I'm kinda surprised that these movies began in 2001 until 2015 and counting, so this series is 14 years old. Buying the 6 DVDs is money very well spent! The awesomeness begins here!Brian (Paul Walker) is an undercover cop who should investigate the illegal street racing, where Dominic (Vin Diesel) is a key person. Brian then establishes relationships among the people, especially to Dominic's sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster), and now finds himself in a middle of a crossroad. Will he perform his duty or will he choose the people who consider him a family?I love the car races. Nice editing, good special effects (for Hollywood 2001), and fantastic soundtrack! I simply adore how this movie moves at lightning speed, thus living up to its title. The scenes will pump up your heart! Hell, yeah! The ending is obviously a cliffhanger, so expect a sequel. And if you're the type of person who stops watching during end credits, watch the credits and listen to the soundtrack. Trust me, okay?I just learned that Walker passed away on November 2013 in a car accident. Rest in Peace, man. All my love and respect go for you.",AdrianOlonan,"Jul 17, 2015"
6,Disappointing...,"...it's a bit like Point Break but with more money and less intelligence.  I make the comparison with Point Break because both movies appear to be about people who live alternative lifestyles without any regard for the law. Although there is an attempt to add some depth to Vin Diesel's character, it doesn't work for me like Patrick Swayze's character in Point Break.  And The Fast and the Furious proved to be a far greater test of my suspension of disbelief.",Pebble-2,"Feb 24, 2003"
1,possibly the worst movie ever made,"For many reasons this could quite possibly be the worst movie ever made. This is an excellent example of the utter contempt that Hollywood shows for its viewers these days. From a totally unbelievable plot line to a multitude of poor acting examples, this movie would actually be worth watching for satire purposes - if it wasn't for the fact that you will waste 90 odd minutes of your life.This movie is a fine example of the 'dumbing down' of audiences worldwide. It is like watching a movie full of 'Fonzie jumping the shark' over and over and will make you wince and feel embarrassed for not only the actors but also the crew who had to sit through this joke of a movie. Actually, I even feel sorry for the people who worked as caterers on this film. If given a choice between watching this movie or being attacked with a claw hammer please, choose the latter.",moorelogic,"Feb 25, 2006"

At least eight, maybe nine, and that's not counting the original version which has almost nothing to do with this one. How this movie spawned a whole industry is beyond me.Not that it is a bad movie, but it really has no depth at all. A guy races cars, and everyone else races cars, and the guy is attracted to another guy's sister. It all falls into place so easily, no hassle, no time to find out who anyone is. And yet, this is the movie that made Paul Walker immortal.",gavin6942,"Aug 23, 2016"
9,A great movie to watch for fun,"Everyone's favorite street racing movie, which is where it all started when the franchise was about illegal racing and not about saving the world from terrorists, when it comes to making movies, sometimes less is more, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker have great chemistry and an interesting dynamic that has become a modern classic. I definitely recommend watching it, it's not the first time I've reviewed all the films in this franchise, but I like this one, the first one, the best.

I hope this movie goes over big, and Vin works his way to the top.  He's just the coolest I've seen on screen this summer.

This is just a good excuse for some fit people who look great to race souped-up production cars at break-neck speed around Los Angeles. Eye-candy Paul Walker (""Brian"") and hardened ""Dom"" (Vin Diesel) look like they are truly pumped up for their roles and given neither have much by the way of dialogue to remember, they just get on with it. The soundtrack is irritating but the production and stunt work match the high octane pace of the film with some seriously innovative action photography and loads of squealing tyres - and I quite enjoyed it.",CinemaSerf,"Sep 2, 2023"

No rating,very good movie,"i too heard rumors that the movie was really bad.  HOWEVER, what some people have to understand before they see the movie is that if you are NOT into cars, yeah - the movie will be bad.  just like any movie.  if you can't associate yourself with the movie - you won't like it.  however, i do a little street racing, and i loved the movie.  you have to be the type of person who likes this stuff - if not, you're going to say it's bad.  now then, ask anybody who likes racing if this is a good movie, and tell me what they say.some people also told me that the plot line lacked a little, but the action scenes made up for it.  this also is not true.  the plot was pretty good compared to other movies i've seen.  as in the section above, you have to be interested in this stuff to follow the whole movie.all in all, this was a good movie.  Vin Diesel played an excellent part in this movie.  ever since 'Pitch Black' was released - I've been waiting to see another movie with him in it.  All characters had a good roll actually.

7,"I Wanted To Hate This Movie, I Really Did","As much as I tried to hate Fast/Furious (and believe me, I did), I found it impossible to do so. Leagues better than Driven, and even more exciting than Gone In Sixty Seconds, this movie has genuine suspense, an engaging plot, good character development for at least Vin Diesel (who, by the way, does a great job), and is just all-around good entertainment. I have a confession to make...I told people this movie was going to suck. Fast/Furious probably lost some money from me, and I just want to apologize. I was going to give this movie an 8 instead of a 7 as an apology, but then I realized the finale leaves too many loose ends, and I'll die before I see a movie called The Faster and the Furiouser, or The Fast and the Furious 2: Even Faster.

The cast is a little too studded, with an unrealistic bad boy undercop.

I mean this movie was obviously about fast cars and hot women. If you couldn't tell that by the trailers then you *deserve* to lose the two hours of you life most reviewers complained about. Go rent Casablanca or something. The cars are slower, but you'll probably enjoy it much more.That being said...I though this was a great movie...for the low/young talent, big budget action movie that it is. The cars are fast and shiny. The women are fast and shiny. Sure the acting is sub-par, the plot is non-existent, and disbelief must be suspended to watch it, but if you're expecting more from a movie about cars with a title as un-original as ""The Fast and the Furious"" then maybe you ought to stop and evaluate where the real disconnect takes place between the quality of Hollywood movies and the people who see them.And yes, this movie made a butt-load of money because it was targeted at the 18-35 male demographic, because guess what...they spend the most money!!!",lysdexic-3,"Jan 14, 2002"

He befriends the leader of said gang, Domenic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and finds himself falling for Dom's younger sister, Mia. The racing aspect of the film is pretty thrilling granted, but the story aspect of the film is way too derivative of 1991's ""Point Break"", and this film can't help but suffers greatly from the comparison.My Grade: C-Original Out of Print edition (FAR superior to the 'Tricked out' Special Edition) DVD Extras: Commentary by Rob Cohen; 18 minute Making of Featurette; The article that inspired the movie; 8 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary; 8 multiple camera angles, plus the final edit for a stunt sequence; Movie magic Interactive Special Effects featurette; 4 and a half minute Featurette on Editing For The MPAA; Visual Effects Montage; 2 Storyboard Comparisons; 3 Music Videos ('Furious' by Ja Rule, 'POV City Anthem' {Edited] by Caddillac Tah, and 'Click Click Boom' by Salivah); Soundtrack spot; a jump to the music menu; Production notes; cast & filmmaker bios; Theatrical Trailer; and promo spots for Universal Theme Parks & an Activision racing game 2 Easter Egg: There's a hidden steering wheel icon to the right of the Stunt sequence link on the main menu, click it for additional multiple angles; A hidden steering wheel can also be found on page one of the 'Racer X Article' DVD Rom: Wallpaper; Screensaver; Jukebox; mini-game; and an Activison Racing game demo",movieman_kev,"Jul 3, 2005"

The races are exciting and the fact that it is not clear who will finish the races to the end point excites you even more.

Even though I watched this movie before, even now I watched the train scene with excitement, holding my breath.I wish it would have been better without erotic scenes in the movie.

(Which i found out on the DVD that many of the lines were). it raises itself just above the typical ""Teen"" movie but still keeps true to that youthful genre.

While the performances and the story wasn't riviting, it was fun and entertaining. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker turn in admirable performances, along with the rest of the supporting cast. Set in the underground racing scene in California, The Fast and The Furious picks you up at the begining and never lets up until the end, keeping you involved in the story until the final scene.

9,There is something about the early 2000's movies I love.,"The Fast and the Furious is a fast-paced action film that uses street racing as a backdrop, with a slick and fast-paced storyline. The film features an undercover cop who finds his loyalty divided between his job and his love for his double life and a deep friendship with his target. The film is slick and fast-paced, with many garrulously painted, tricked-out imports graced the screen. The cars used in the driving sequences are impressive, even for non-car enthusiasts. Paul Walker, the main star, delivers an easygoing, dude-like performance, comparing him to young Paul Newman or Robert Redford. He is an uber-good looking pin-up boy with just the right amount of roughness around his edges. Co-star Vin Diesel is equally assured on-screen, with charisma from his scene-stealing riffs in Pitch Black and The Boiler Room. The rest of the cast is rounded out by young stars like Chad Lindberg, Michelle Rodriguez, Matt Schulze, Johnny Strong, and Jordana Brewster. Despite the cliched undercover cop themeology, the film is a fun and entertaining diversion in this summer of stagnated epics and dundering blockbusters. The film's editing style and the use of street racing as a backdrop make it an entertaining and entertaining film. The Fast and the Furious is a thrilling film that pays tribute to Bullitt and The Road Warrior with minimal CGI enhancements. The driving sequences are both thrilling and nail-biting, with a nighttime heist scene and a final heist that resembles RW. The FX and stunt teams use CGI rendering to create zoom lens, manga-styled madness during street racing sequences or take the viewer on an Alice in Wonderland trip through an NOS-injected internal combustion system. The film is loud, brash, and entertaining, making it a perfect summer film. The cast keeps themselves in tune with the storyline without being too campy, and the film is a must-watch for fans of the franchise. ""The Fast and the Furious"" is a movie that takes place in a world beyond the law, with Vin Diesel as Toretto, a star of street racing. The film features a slicker production than films like ""Grand Theft Auto,"" but still has a pirate spirit. It features great chase scenes and includes the most incompetent cop who ever went undercover. The movie takes place in Los Angeles, where cars four abreast speed down city streets. Brian, a man who wants to break into street racing, meets his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) at a bar where she serves tuna salad on white bread, no crusts. Brian saves Toretto's friendship by saving him from the cops. The races involve cars four abreast at speedway speeds down city streets, making it easier in Los Angeles due to the lack of traffic and cops. Brian initially appears just like a guy who wants to race, but is revealed as a cop in an early scene. He works for a unit with its undercover headquarters in a Hollywood house, and his boss claims that Eddie Fisher built this house for Elizabeth Taylor in the 1950s. The movie tells a story and explains its characters, providing a refreshing change from no-plot, all-action movies like ""Gone in 60 Seconds."" It also shows Paul and Mia falling in love, although it is not supposed to be done in theory. Michelle Rodriguez, the star of the boxing movie ""Girlfight,"" co-stars as a member of the hijack gang and gets to land one solid right on a guy's jaw to keep her credentials. While its na amazing movie, ""The Fast and the Furious"" delivers what it promises to deliver, with grandiose self-pitying dialogue that has been treasured in movies like ""Rebel Without a Cause.""",moviesfilmsreviewsinc,"Dec 16, 2024"
10,A High-Octane Masterpiece,"Buckle up, because ""The Fast and the Furious"" is a high-octane joyride that will leave you breathless from start to finish. This 2001 cinematic gem, directed by Rob Cohen, is not just a movie; it's a pulse-pounding adrenaline rush that defined a generation of action films. From the screeching tires to the heart-stopping races, this film takes you on a thrilling journey through the underground world of street racing in Los Angeles.One of the strongest aspects of this film is its gripping storyline. The narrative is tightly woven, keeping the audience engaged right from the opening scene. The characters are well-developed, each with their unique personalities and motivations, adding depth to the overall story. Moreover, the film expertly explores themes of loyalty, friendship, and the blurred lines between right and wrong, making it more than just a typical action movie.The races in this film are nothing short of spectacular. The choreography and attention to detail in these sequences are astonishing, making every gear shift and nitrous boost feel incredibly real. The adrenaline-fueled races are complemented by a heart-pounding soundtrack that perfectly captures the intensity of the moment, enhancing the overall viewing experience.The cast delivers outstanding performances across the board. Vin Diesel shines as Dominic Toretto, exuding charisma and intensity in every scene. Paul Walker, as Brian O'Conner, delivers a compelling performance, capturing the struggle between duty and friendship flawlessly. The chemistry between the cast members is palpable, adding authenticity to their relationships and making the emotional moments resonate even more.In addition to its gripping story and thrilling races, ""The Fast and the Furious"" is a testament to great filmmaking. The direction is sharp, the cinematography is dynamic, and the editing is slick, creating a visually stunning movie-going experience. The attention to detail in capturing the car culture and the underground racing scene is commendable, immersing the audience in this adrenaline-fueled world.For me, ""The Fast and the Furious"" is a perfect 10/10. It's not just a movie; it's a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time. Whether you're a fan of action films, car enthusiasts, or simply someone looking for an electrifying movie night, this film delivers on all fronts. Fasten your seatbelts and get ready for a wild ride because ""The Fast and the Furious"" is an unforgettable cinematic thrill that will leave you wanting more.Thanks for reading the review.

No rating,One damn fine movie!,"I'd heard a few conflicting comments about ""The Fast and the Furious"" and I wanted to see it anyway, so I dragged along a friend. We were blown away! This is one fantastic movie!From the cars to the actors, the adrenaline pumping drag races or the overall impact of the realism, it's hard to say what we liked the best.The story was amazing, taking us right into the underworld of illegal street racing, and into the lives of the main characters, especially Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian Spilner (Paul Walker). A lot of comments that I'd heard about the movie thought that the little mottos of the movie were pathetic (things like ""I live my life a quater mile at a time"" and ""It don't matter if you win by an inch or a mile, winning is winning"") If they were delivered by an actor with less screen prescence than Vin Diesel, they might have sounded corny, but as a part of the overall movie, they made sense and added to the character of Dom Toretto.I gave this movie a 7/10.

Crap plot, lame acting and terrible dialogue add up to a waste of Vin Diesel's time.  I really enjoy seeing Mr. Diesel on the screen, but this film did nothing to advance his career.  I do hope that he's more selective the next go around.  I gave it a 3 of 10 for the cars and racing. It was probably too high...",deadsenator,"Feb 16, 2002"
9,Fast and Furious...a real boy's movie,"Here's one for the boys!  This is no chic flick and really is great fun. OK, the acting's not great, but the pace is good and the cars are brilliant.

Rewatching the 2001 film The Fast and the Furious, I find myself appreciating it even more. I've said this before, but I still think this film is the best entry in the series. The cast, characters, and plot all work so well together to sell the fun and drama, creating a cohesive and engaging experience.One of the things I enjoy most about this film is its simpler approach. The story revolves around street racing and undercover investigations, with a focus on realistic driving rather than over-the-top stunts. I like that it's less reliant on CGI and the driving sequences feel more authentic. This grounded style makes the action more believable and immersive.I appreciate that the film doesn't ask me to believe that cars can fly, or that fistfights on planes with never-ending runways are a thing, or that battles between cars and submarines are legitimate. Sometimes, less is more, and The Fast and the Furious proves that by keeping the action and drama within the realm of possibility.The chemistry between Paul Walker and Vin Diesel is fantastic. Their dynamic adds depth to the story and makes the characters' relationships feel genuine. Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster also deliver strong performances, rounding out a cast that brings charisma and energy to the screen.The plot, while straightforward, is compelling. The blend of high-octane racing scenes and undercover cop drama keeps me engaged from start to finish. There's a sense of raw excitement and tension that still holds up, even after multiple viewings.Overall, my rewatch of The Fast and the Furious is a mostly positive experience that reminds me why I fell in love with the series in the first place. The film's realistic driving scenes, strong cast, and effective storytelling make it a standout in the franchise. It's a film that I can always come back to and enjoy.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.5

No rating,Good movie,"Great actors, great cars, bad plot. The movie leaves you hanging in the end. But the cars were awesome.. I love that orange supra. The movie is good and gives you an adrenaline rush with its fast cars, Racing, and very well done stunts. But I think the producer ran out of time to get all that he wanted to get involved in this movie. A lot of the main characters were shady. It will leave you guessing in the end.",ILovePaulWalker,"Jul 26, 2001"
2,*puke*,"A true mystery for the rest of society to ponder: how this movie could possibly be so popular, with its preposterous plot and truly awful acting. I'm really not sure which is worse, but I do know this: STAY AWAY FROM THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS.",X-9er,"Jan 2, 2002"
9,Go for A Ride!!!,"One of the reasons I go to the movies is to be entertained & get away from reality - the Fast & the Furious truly sucked me into another world that I wouldn't even have thought existed and I enjoyed the movie for what it was...fast cars, action packed scenes, more fast cars, Paul Walker's good looks & Van Diesel's hot pumpin' biceps! Bring it on, I say! This is one of the best adrenalin rush I ever got sitting down!",catherina-2,"Sep 21, 2001"
2,A perfect metaphor for L.A...,"In that this film can be described in three simple words: Big, Loud and above all, Pointless.The story was barely beyond one-dimensional (the ending was so so telegraphed, it defies description) as was the acting. Paul Walker find another profession or you will end in the roles that Wings Hauser would turn down.On the upside, there were the car stunts, which were stunning and my marks for this film is because of those stunts only.2 out of 10 for the stunts. A flat zero for everything else.",TomPaine-3,"Sep 23, 2001"
9,The Fast and the Furious Rocks!,"I was really looking forward to watching this movie and I was not disappointed.  It was awesome!  ""The Fast and the Furious had some of the best car chases ever filmed.  Paul Walker did a great job as the undercover cop, he has a bright future in the movie industry.  Vin Diesel was awesome as Dominic, he just looks cool and he can kick butt.  This movie has everything women, fast cars, guns, and a kick butt soundtrack.  This is a must see for all action fans and if you want a adrenline rush this is the movie to see.  Rob Cohen did a great job with this action masterpiece.  I give ""Fast and the Furious"" ****stars and two thumbs up!",tuckernutz,"Jun 23, 2001"
9,An adrenaline rush,"The Fast and the Furious is fast, furious, and FUN.

No rating,FINALLY!! A film that lives up to it's title,"Film fans may have been disappointed last summer after Snatch, Shaft and X-Men were all released, yet failed to live up to their respective titles (c'mon, think about it). This year however, we finally have a film whose title we can rely on, for director Rob Cohen has served us up something both fast and furious.Brian Spilner (Walker) is an undercover cop assigned to infiltrate a street racing gang suspected of highway robberies to help pay for their expensive parts. Despite losing an invigorating race against the gang's head leader Dom Toretto (Diesel), Brian earns his respect by saving him from the police.Under pressure to close the case, Brian gets drawn further into the underground world as he falls for Dom's sister, leaving him facing a choice between his new lifestyle or his job.Based loosely around a magazine article about late night Japanese racing gangs, F+F explodes onto our screens with a ferocious race scene within the first 15 minutes. The awesome filming style of Cohen leaves us on the edge of our seats as the sheer pace of the cars scream past the camera. Cohen's hook is just the beginning however, as the entire movie is dominated by souped up cars that make Gran Turismo look like go-karts.Star of the show however is the gravel-voiced Vin Diesel as Dom. Here is one screen tough guy that you know has the brawn to back his words. When he tells Brian that if he breaks his sister's heart, then he'll break his neck, there's little doubt over whether he means it. Diesel's terrific performance comes off the back of last year's success in Pitch Black and it seems Hollywood has finally found a new hard man.The plot is slightly thin on the ground, but that is more than made up for by Cohen's work behind the camera and Diesel's in front of it. The hundred minutes are choc full  of nutty stunts, gorgeous girls, fast cars and cool lines  if ever there was an antichrist of chick-flicks then this is it.After a summer of big budget flops and box office disasters, F+F took just a weekend to make back it's costs in America. The race scene should be worth your money alone, but if that's not enough, then the chance to see Vin Diesel, a star in the making, should be: and for once you won't be disappointed by the title.8/10",KerryW,"Sep 6, 2001"
1,I hated this movie,"This movie has continuity mistakes coming out of everywhere, it has a cliched and predictable plot, and wooden acting.  If you are the kind of person that has less than 5 brain cells and likes ogling hot chicks or fast cars, then you might get some enjoyment out of it, but if you have the intellect past that of a 5th grader, then I hope to God you're mature enough to realize how much of a crock this movie is.",dustin44444,"Feb 1, 2002"
9,"Enjoyable, Fast, Exciting, Horse-power.","Contrary to the other post I have seen on this movie, I enjoyed it. I have to admit that it was definitely predictable at some points but other parts did keep you guessing, especially if you didn't read movie inlay/plot sumary. I'm sure many will agree though, anything it lost in predictability it made up with sheer horse-power and speed. The cinematography techniques used in this movie to enhance the viewers experience with the speed were excellently designed and implemented. I was especially glad to see a movie about fast cars and racing that didn't break down into some romance or deep-felt-drama. It kept its side topics light and its main plot prominant.I recommend viewing this movie, it was worth the £3.75 rental charge.",chaos-addicts,"Mar 17, 2002"
1,Jesus christ,"Oh my god, what a load of garbage. The single most cheesiest movie of 2001.

8,"Finally, a great new action flick!","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! Although it obviously exaggerated the street racing scene, The Fast and the Furious presented a refreshingly different type of movie. The engine sounds were so real and sensory that I felt like I was really there. And the cinematography was especially well done (the scene with the train where the film built to a crescendo). Perhaps its the dank greens, but I really got a rush from seeing this film!Go see this flick!",weeatphish,"Jul 5, 2001"

No rating,the stupid and the furious,"Why did they make a movie of this? Your'e probably saying to yourself: to entertain people. I can understand that, but the movie has no plot no interesting charcaters or anything, its all about racing. Understandable. At least they should've had more American muscle in it besides the Charger. If you want to make a racing movie, make a documentary instead.",rott21,"Nov 15, 2003"
8,Lot of action and lot of cars !!!!,"There's a lot of action, a lot of cars, and it's a lot of fun to watch. Please don't take Fast and Furious as a serious piece of drama when you watch it. As a thoughtless action film featuring fast cars, watch it.",neelakshbansal,"Jun 8, 2021"
1,The king of the car films??,"SOME SPOILERS CONTAINED!The fast and the furious.... If this title is told many people think about the coolest film on earth, the greatest cars and the greatest drivers. I don't know yet why though. I am personally into cars. I'm also interested in mechanics and electronics in general and I do know about that topic so don't tell me I have no clue what I'm going to talk about. The film is made for 6-year-olds. There are ""cool"" (in my point of view pretty stupid) paint jobs, roaring engines and of course NO2! And then there is Vin Diesel who plays cocky Torreto. So they race illegally and the young cop is sent out to investigate the racing. The racing is nothing spectacular. 400 meters straight line, the best built car wins or whose engine can manage the most turbo pressure or nitrous in other words. In total there are only few races throughout the whole film and it's rather boring to watch them. The cars the characters are racing could not be as powerful as real drag racing cars so the handling should be relatively easy as well. That fact already doesn't make the racers heroes in front of my eyes.But racing is acceptable. The worst part of the movie is Torreto's gang truck robbing. It is so unrealistic and stupid that I don't have words for it. Every thinking person can understand how lame it looks. You can't hold on the truck with nothing to worry about when a truck is traveling about 100 km/h. And just how it looks. Truck drivers don't really do anything to get rid of them except the last one who starts shooting the gang. And finally the whole story limps. It's very stereotypical and overall boring. I'm not gonna spoil too much but basically the undercover working cop merges into Torreto's gang and eventually starts defending Torreto. In the end he still founds out that Torreto is involved to truck robbing and tries to put the end to that. He also flirts with Torreto's sister. Some gang members speculate he's a cop but Torreto doesn't take that seriously etc. In other words quite boring story.All in all I'd say that Fast and furious is a weak movie, unrealistic and quite boring. I don't know how this movie is so highly respected because for me it really doesn't look anything special.2/10",christhjian,"Dec 31, 2010"
10,Definitely in my top 10,This movie is great and so nostalgic to me. Everyone looks so young and vibrant and everything about this movie is just great. It has so much heart and the direction is smooth as hell. Definitely one of my favorite movies of all time.,TheGravyTrain05,"Jul 6, 2021"
8,Not Since the Road Warrior...,"This movie was a trip.  I never expected to have such a wild ride and so much adrenalized fun.  The main reason I went to see this movie was Vin Diesel - who is not very well know - yet - but I am pretty sure he will be. He has an incredible voice (he was the robot in The Iron Giant, a highly recommended favorite of mine) and a charismatic presence that reminds me of a young Marlon Brando.  He also played Riddick in Pitch Black which I plan to review eventually.Don't get me wrong, this movie does not make my top 10 or anything close. The story is pretty generic, young-undercover-cop material with only a not-too surprising twist or two.  Some of the acting was a little strained and weak which can often tank a whole movie (for me).  But this movie did something to me that I haven't felt since the 2nd Mad Max film, The Road Warrior... it raised the bar on visual action and ""the need for speed"".  It wasn't cinematography either - to me (I am not an expert) - but something incredible happened in the way this movie was edited, filmed, and scored. It was just a thing of beauty.  The sounds, the motor, the pitch, the beat, and then being jacked inside the engine; to spit through the fuel injection, feel the power of combustion and then be ejected out the tail pipe as the car roars away from you... breathtaking... and all that is just the rush of the car lurching in to first gear on go.I was expecting to recommend this movie just so you can get a handle on who Vin Diesel is and how great this guy is gonna be in movies in the coming years (in my humble opinion).  I didn't expect to O.D. on adrenaline and walk out of the theater ready to rev the engine right out of my poor little Mitsubishi Galant's frame.  I warn you - seriously - be careful driving home after watching this movie.  For me, doing 42 M.P.H. in a 35 on the way home felt like I was standing still.  It was painfully frustrating.  After being reasonably disappointed by Pearl Harbor and The Mummy Returns, this movie has restored my faith.Normally I walk out of a movie feeling like I know when a director has made a great movie. I have to say I was confused when thinking about the director on this movie. I haven't even gone and looked up who it is - I usually do and try to keep the names and credits straight when I know a great director or at least one I recognize and/or like. But I guess that is what I am trying to say here; I did not get that feeling this time. I somehow - do not - feel like it was the director that delivered this incredible ride to me. Somewhere between the hyper-speed action, incredible music/sound, and the charisma of Vin Diesel I want to believe this movie hit its mark regardless of the director. Or maybe they knocked a damn good movie up two notches beyond what the director envisioned.",Jeremy Farrance,"Jun 16, 2002"
No rating,I thought it was a good movie actualy,"I personaly thought this was a rather good movie with all the needs for a good film.

9,Intense! And pretty much a roller coaster ride.,"Obviously, the plot centering on an undercover cop infiltrating a biker gang or a fast-car gang, in this case is really nothing new.  It's the delivery that matters.  And boy do they deliver!  This film is a showcase for performance parts and will no doubt make mechanics drool.  The actors definitely did very well with what they had to work with.  On the technical side, cars that were able to speed away after popping it's header's nuts from over-pressure was a bit too much to swallow.  But putting technical expertise, quality and angles of photography, degrees of socially redeemable values aside...Was it a fun film to watch?  You bet!  I believe I got more than my money's worth.  I'll be watching it again just for the fun factor.",rude dog,"Jun 29, 2001"
1,The horror!,"I finally saw this on Starz this weekend. Boy am I glad I didn't pay to see it at the theaters.EVERYTHING about this movie is terrible. You would think that if they were going to make a movie about street racing they would at least get that part right but not in this case. The depiction of street racing is completely moronic (these guys are doing 160 on crowd lined public streets for minutes at a time, idiotic.) Apparently as little research went into the topic of the film as went into the ridiculous script and the hunt for actual actors (saying this cast were bad actors would be a slap to the face of bad actors everywhere.) So, THIS is the movie that made Vin Diesel a ""star""?! This movie goes to prove that his horrible acting in Pitch Black was no fluke, he really is as wooden as a 2x4.
1/10 (too bad there is not a 0/10 option)P.S. I really thought it would be a LOOOONG time before I saw another ""big"" movie worse than Battlefield Earth, but this POS only made me wait one year and makes Battlefield Earth play like Citizen Kane.",Heresy,"Aug 4, 2002"

8,"Walker and Diesel give good performances, and great stunts help this movie a lot","Vin Deisel and Paul Walker give good performances as cop and street racer, and the great stunts and action help the crummy story line. Walker play Brian O'Connor, undercover cop who is trying to bust street racers in L.A. Dominic (Diesel) is one of them. However, as Brian is sucked in to the street racer world, he and Dominic become better friends. One thing Dominic does not know about Brian is that he is a cop. As war clashes between Dominic and his rival Johnny Tran, the cops start closing in on the street racers. The story is really stupid, but the great stunts and action make up for that. Vin Diesel is great in his role and new star Walker, is great as well. In Dominic's words ""It doesn't matter if you win by an inch or a mile, winning is winning,"" ""The Fast and the Furious"" comes out to be a winner, by one inch.*** out of ****",danthemovieman,"Oct 26, 2002"
No rating,Excellent!,"I saw the preview for this a while back, and it looked not so good.  Vin Diesel playing the same part as usual, and a lot of cars.Good advance word of mouse persuaded me to give it a go, and I am real glad I saw it.  It's a really good film: exciting, great music, some great action, decent acting.  The plot...well, there's some holes there!  Don't think too much about that, just enjoy the ride.",briginsh,"Jun 27, 2001"
1,One of the worse movies ever!,"This movie reassured me of the fact that, people are sheep!  This movie is god awful, it has no story and the acting is so bad!  It's not exciting in the least. There is no pacing; there is no atmosphere, nothing.  I watched this movie with an ex-girlfriend and listened to her go on and on about how ""hot Paul Walker and Vin Diesel are"" and ""isn't that car so cool, wow there going fast..."" blah blah blah.  I'm sorry, I guess having taste means that movies that have ""cool cars"" and ""hot guys"" or in my case ""hot girls"" are just not enjoyable.  Yet, this movie made a lot of money and there even making a sequel.  Being a young actor/film maker in drama school, I guess maybe I'll write a script about big shiny things and explosions and it will out gross Titanc.  All I need is Vin Diesel to star now...oh and I guess what was really funny was when my drama teacher showed this movie as how NOT to act and make a movie...that was the most enjoyable part to this rubbish. Save your money, and your brain cells.",Wrestlord1,"Dec 13, 2002"
8,From the times when physics were still a thing in the fast & fruious series...,"Just finished watching it again... Awesome! I wonder why this movie doesn't have a better rating... Really it's awesome, it's the reason why there have been 9+ other Fast & Furious Movies added to the series! But to be honest this one is really by far the best and I also like that this one is from the times when Fast & Furious wasn't fames for riduculously unrealistic stunts and physics that are a joke. Truly the new ones are so overdone, especially because of the physics... But this one! This one nails it in so many ways and it feels so mach better watching it!

5,OK film - did it encourage the 3 guys who died last month racing on my freeway?,"I didn't want to see his movie, but my friends really wanted to see it bad. It was sold out, but we got into the 12:15am show time and the theater was packed! AT 12:15!! I don't understand what the appeal of this movie is. A bunch of fast cars? Fast cars does not a good movie make.The dialogue of this movie was terrible. There wasn't anything interesting said the whole time. My friends (who LOVED the movie) tried to defend it saying that they talked like real people talk. Well, if I want to see real people talk I'll go to the barber shop or something; somewhere where I don't have to pay $8.25. Such lines as ""It doesn't matter if you win by an inch or a mile, winning is winning."" and ""I'll have the tuna fish,"" are the most memorable, and believe me they really sucked.The plot hardly got in the way of the blatant attempt to make a movie just for the reason of a bunch of cars going really fast. And audiences couldn't WAIT to see a bunch of cars going really fast. Maybe these people should watch NASCAR or something, then they won't have to worry about ignoring some piddly plot. If you want to see a GOOD movie with cars see Bullitt.",howardbrown,"Feb 1, 2012"
8,Point Break on wheels !!!,This one was far better than Gone In 60 Seconds. At least you care for the characters. The plot is pretty much the same as the one in Point Break (undercover cop becomes friends with the ones he has to bust) but what makes it so fun is Rob Cohen's direction and the action sequences. The whole racing scenes are well worth the price of admission. You feel danger and excitement on every action-packed part of this movie. Vin Diesel looks cool and strong.

9,"if you like fast cars and fast women like me, then this flick is hot!!","The plot is a little cliche...the characters are not the most deep or developed...but who the hell cares!  this movie is about fast cars, lots of action, and big bad ass Vin Diesel with some hottie chicks beside him (and Paul Walker for you ladies out there).  The story has been done before (think Point Break with drag racing instead of surfing and there you go), but its done well for what it attempts to accomplish: fast and furious fun! No other movie has ever given me such an urge to jump into my car and put the pedal to the medal...unfortunately, I drive nothing like the cars in the movie, so I don't go anywhere when I floor it.  But let me tell you, the cars in this movie are smoking!  The action is fast paced and explosive, and the story built around it may not be Oscar caliber, but it sure is entertaining.  I would see this movie again anytime, even for the rush of the racing scenes alone. But even as a total package, the movie does one thing perfectly that few movies lately have accomplished: keeps me entertained from start to finish.",blade99,"Jul 2, 2001"

The amount of BS special effects and CGI. I don't want to make comparisons (because the intention was not the same) but this is a bit like comparing the masterpiece ""Jurassic Park"" of Spielberg to JW: Dominion. But that's what you get when you change the subject, or worse forget it, because you want to make it about saving the world.Anyway! The point is: this movie is a historical piece of my generation, like a lot of other things I mentioned. Like some other reviewers wrote, don't try get deep in the thin plot, but understand the importance and the impact it made for young highschoolers and their (my) generation.PS.

9,Furiously Moving Up My Top 10,Great Movie!! Although the ending was pretty predictable all the twists and turns made it seem that it wasn't going to happen that way Characters are developed nicely and the action is never far off.. I'm Going To Go See This One Again!,jeffgotslapped,"Jun 26, 2001"
No rating,totally ruled,"I can't really say how much I liked this movie.  The action was great. Every race scene was amazing...especially the first one you see, since you don't know what to expect.  The acting was pretty good, too.  I didn't expect great acting, but I was a little surprised.  Acting didn't compare to the cars, though.  If you like cars, then you'll love this movie.My friend and I watched this movie stoned.  Since he was driving, let's just say it was a very high-speed ride into town after we left.  That totally ruled, too.",j_rolls_84,"Jul 25, 2001"
1,Very Disappointing!!!,"I must say that I was more than disappointed with this movie after renting it.  I rushed out to rent it based on the four star review given by my nephew (who's only seventeen). That should have been a clue right there. This movie is for kids!!!  It seriously lacks realism, intelligent dialogue and has no plot that is worth following.  It seems that this movie was made simply to show off a few fancy cars, which may be the only thing worth looking at in this movie.  Don't look for any award winning acting or a story here.  The only beneficial outcome to this movie experience for me is that I didn't shell out twenty dollars to buy this movie.",Capman2002,"Jan 17, 2002"
8,I love hot cars and testosterone...this is the film that launched a franchise.,"This film was fantastic back in the day and it still seems to hold up to the test of time. This was one of those action packed summer films that got everyone excited and eventually launched a whole fast and furious franchise.The story begins with an undercover cop trying to break in to a tight knit crew of street racers who are pulling high speed heists of semi-trucks on the California freeway system and being lead by the tough but principled Dominic Toretto (played by Vin Diesel). Our undercover cop Brian (played by the now deceased Paul Walker) must first win Don's respect. The two eventually develop mutual respect and as we get to know Dom's whole crew Letty, the only girl and Dom's old lady, Jesse who is brilliant but ADHD has really prevented him from excelling at school, Vince who is a hot head but known Dom the longest...and Leon who is the most underdeveloped but stable character in the group. Then there is Mia, Dom's younger and much more attractive sister...who also catches Brian's eyes.This is less of a cat and mouse and more of a love letter to racing...and a life of speed. I appreciated the elaborate thefts and the joint taskforce's difficulties in finding the real culprits before the truck drivers start their own vigilante justice.This is and was a great film. If you are at all interested in an action adventure film built around cars and honor among thieves...this is the film for you.It has a decent soundtrack, a decent romance, great cars, decent heist story, but what sets this film apart is the camaraderie of the crew and the mutual respect between Dom and Brian. Very testosterone heavy...but I for one liked it.",cgvsluis,"May 29, 2023"
1,There's 90 minutes I won't get back...,"Point Break, with cars instead of surf boards. And really stupid drivers. Only not as good. And totally lacking in moral compass.",rwmccauley,"Mar 8, 2003"
8,Street racing at it's peak and good acting,"This is a fast paced movie about illegal street racing.  There is an interesting sideline plot involving other illegal activity, but the cars and the acting are the real winners.  Portrayed in style the cars show us the subculture of street racing and a general love for speed.  Vin Desil just shines in this movie... If you haven't developed a love for his acting you will, he hasn't been in much but he has captured notice of even Speilberg. Flics: pitch black (decent sci-fi), broiler room (good illegal trading movie) and few others.  Most of the other acting in the movie is first rate which allows you to stay focused throughout.  Although this movie does not sport a lot of big names this movie may provide us with a few new stars in the years to come.",gcarroll,"Jul 2, 2001"
8,"Great movie, but...","I went in wanting to see this movie, and it delivered on everything I had hoped for.  It did have a reasonable plot, and what it was lacking for in plot it made up for in character development.  It had style and great actions scenes.  The story never got boring, and I stayed interested until the end.  I am sure that eveyone leaving the theater with me wanted to burn rubber as they drove home. (The difference being, I can, in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd!) What is lacking in this movie is any intelligent explanation of the science behind the speed.  Throughout the movie we learn 2 things.  1, nitrous makes a car go faster, and 2, you have to press the button at the right time.  I dont think I ever heard anyone in this movie mention the size of the engine for any of the cars raced.  Diesel, who again does a great job - contrary to those who assume big muscles mean no brains and automatically pan him - does give a top to bottom on his father's car, but it is never raced.  I guess we have to assume these are basically japanese compact cars that are painted nicely and mod'd out to the max, and that's the only reason they come close to matching the speed and power of classic street-rods. Still, I really would have liked there to have been more explanations of why Car A is faster than Car B, and known why Car B's driver needs to use his wits to win. Of course, the writers must have known, it doesnt really matter.",chase_pc,"Jun 24, 2001"
No rating,no it didn't,First of all there has to be something wrong with you.  this was a great movie.  Just because it was so good my father went out and bought the video and dvd.  And dad doesn't buy anything that is for dvd unless he thinks it good.  so I give it a 11/10.,Jessicle,"Apr 16, 2002"
1,Pure Crap.,"Terrible acting, plot, music was pretty bad (with the exception of the Organic Audio song included in the score), underdeveloped characters, poor script, lame one-liners, crappy cinamatography. Vin Deisel's acting was sub-par and dissapointing at best. Drawn on filler scenes quickly became monotonous. Cheesy love story with no substance or point. I give it a 1/10",rbbrfsh,"Feb 10, 2003"

I'm sorry but I'm just not impressed with this movie at all. I felt like I was watching a 2 hour car commercial for a Honda Civic. Good cinematography, bad acting, bad plot, bad direction. At least I didn't pay for my ticket.",xperiencethecoop,"Jul 28, 2001"
9,An excellent CAR movie,"I've read a lot of reviews saying they hated FnF because it had a shallow plot, only fair acting, and (gasp) even to many cars in it. People, this is not American Beauty or Magnolia. It's a car movie. Thus, when preparing to see such a movie, dismiss plot, character depth, and storyline as a non-issue. Then, if it turns out to have those things, you can be fairly amazed. If it does not, that is fine too, for you got to see a bunch of beautiful cars going at high speeds on city streets, which was well and often pulled off in the movie. If you can't deal with movies that aren't oscar contenders, don't see movies like this. jeez.",alternity2k,"Oct 5, 2001"
8,A rebuttal of Theo Robertson's critique.,"The user comments by 36-year-old Theo Robertson of Isle of Bute, Scotland, are sort of valid, although he is very dismissive and critical of TFATF's plot and ""product placement.""  Like it's a bad thing.  Perhaps living on an island in Scotland does not equip one to understand or fairly ""criticise"" a southern Californian car-cult movie.  And he's 36, ""...too old to enjoy TFATF by about...oh, twenty years?""  I am 61 and I thought it was a fun movie.  In New Mexico, we know A LOT about custom cars, low-riders and high-riders, and we understand how (and WHY)one might put tens of thousands of dollars into creating a really boss machine.  Sure, TFATF is pure science fiction, the science being the cars and the fiction being the likelihood of scores of custom race car afficionados being able to commandeer a ""deserted"" street for a midnight race.  But yes, the car cult does cross race and ethnic lines, because it's all about the cars....  And so what if the film has a lot of ""product placement""?  Personally, I didn't even understand half of what the characters were talking about when it came to custom engine parts.  The movie does one thing very well:  it entertains.  Obviously. There's a very successful sequel out now.  Compared to other movies in its sub-genre, The Fast and The Furious deserves an 8 or 9.",Vedek,"May 25, 2004"
No rating,I loved it!,"I absolutly loved this movie.  Think about it...hot guys, GOOD actors and actresses, hot cars, and intense action, what more could you ask for? Remember street racing is fun.  It's common.  Not rare.  There are hot guys. Just sit back and enjoy the movie.  I promise it's a great one that shows you what really happens just with a bit of a Hollywood twist.",jemmiesix,"Oct 13, 2001"
1,The WORST movie ever made in the movie industry!,I saw this movie last summer when it first came out and it is definitely THE WORST movie I have EVER seen in my life! Even with the hot sexy Asian guys! There was no plot at all! It was just a bunch of people driving cars. What the f#$% was the point of the movie???!!!! If you want to see fast cars you can just go to a NASCAR race or something. There was absolutely NO PLOT in this stupid movie. Just fast cars. I can't believe I spent $5.00 to see this stupid piece of crap. I'd rather eat my toes than ever see this movie again. A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME.,queenofdystopia,"Mar 17, 2002"
8,I enjoyed it...,"Okay, here we go.  I like to consider myself and intelligent individual, so when I was reading comments I was surprised to see such things as "" if you have an IQ of over 80 stay away from this film"" and other comments like ""the film spent too much money on the cars and couldn't afford good actors"" (or something to that notion...).  I personally am the type of person that appreciates a good film with a good story line, great actors, and deep underlying concepts.. but give me a break.  Not every movie is made for that reason.  The reason I enjoyed The Fast and the Furious is quite simple... it has something for everyone... well, almost everyone, there are always the people who can find something wrong with it.  It has fast cars, actors people like to see on the screen along with some fresh faces, characters that people identify with, and an action packed storyline.  What more could you want?  Some say the dialogue wasn't so great... okay, what exactly would you say when you wanted the tuna fish sandwich?  The dialogue fit in with the situations they were in... you couldn't expect more.  So, to sum it up, I liked the Fast and the Furious for the simple reason that it was an enjoyable, action packed film with likeable actors and dream-like cars.",SweetAsCherries,"Jun 6, 2002"

The race scenes were great. I also enjoyed the cast. I think we should expect big things in Vin Diesel. He is a great actor that I think will soon be in BIG demand. Not to mention that he is great to look at. I plan to buy this video to keep with my favorites!!",dimille1011,"Feb 11, 2002"
No rating,Wow,"If you like action movies with fast cars, loud pumping sound tracks and suspense that just won't let go then this is a movie for you. The race sequences blast the car movie into the 21st century with a new, gritty, streetwise angle on car culture and street dragging.Vin Diesel turns out another fine performance as the charismatic leader of a street car 'team' at the cutting edge of road car technology. I couldn't help but admire this anti-hero and the honourable loyalty portrayed by his tight nit group of desperados.Okay so there's very little in the way of 'message' or 'social comment' but that ain't what this movie is about. It's not even attempting to pamper your intellect. It's only intent is to get your adrenaline flowing and to stop you breathing which it succeeds at admirably.Go and see this movie, hold on to your seat, hit that NOS button and don't close your eyes until the final, white knuckle ride which will leave you breathless and stunned.Just don't forget that it's only a movie and drive home carefully. This is easier said than done, as I've never seen so many wheel spins and tyre smoke in the theatre car park. 10/10",anaveragejoe,"Sep 23, 2001"
2,Fast and the Furious? How about Lame and Curious...,"Well folks, I thought I'd see an entertaining film..  What I saw instead was The Fast and the Furious...  This movie should have been Gone in 60 Seconds, maybe it should have been put out of its misery with a Bullitt...  Hmmm, Deathrace 2000 would have been more humane...Anyway, I thought his movie would have brought back some of my own feelings of blacktop mayhem (hmmm, should I copyright that?  Blacktop Mayhem.... Could be next summers Fast and the Furious, eh?)...  Tooling around town in my turbocharged Daytona, sometimes I get the same feeling I used to get when my ground pounding '69 SuperBee belched fire and roared thunder from its 383 Magnum...What I got instead was a lame excuse to show a bunch of imported pocket rockets burning up the road...  The street race scene, supposedely a 1/4 mile race (but never actually stated to be such) took much, MUCH longer than the accelerated film speed would indicate.  Heck, it seemed like a full mile...  I've seen races at Belmont run faster than this!  Oh, wait, and we're supposed to believe that our hero is able to operate TWO computer interfaces for his fuel management system and GPS locator (okay, that's a joke, but hell, so is his movie) while he's blasting down the road at over 140 mph, FOUR abreast!  Not me, baby, I'm gonna have MY eyes glued to the road and those OTHER idiots!I almost, ALMOST got interested in this movie when they started to try to develop a plot.  Okay, so Brian's a cop, he's undercover, and Dom and Trang are under suscpicion for truck hijacking...  The Feds are involved, they want the hijacking stopped before the truckers start arming themselves for vigilante justice.  Boys and girls, trucker vigilante justice (hmmmm, another nice phrase for a summer movie) would have been MUCH more entertaining - as witnessed by the scene when one of our hapless hijackers is pinned down by a faceless shotgun wielding trucker...OH, and wait... At the end of the movie...  Well, I won't spoil it (the movie itself does a passable job of doing that), our ""hero"" performs an action that is SO out of character, that is SO anti-reality as to cause one to sit in one's chair with his mouth hanging in disbelief...  Are we to actually believe that a cop, sworn to uphold the law, who's every movement has been scrutinized by not only his superiors and the FBI is going to act in the way he did after the final action sequence?  I think not.Save yourself a lot of grief and a little expense.  Do NOT buy this movie unless you see it on the $5.99 rack.  Wait for it to come out on cable... Trust me...",WxMan_II,"Jan 28, 2002"
9,TRU,"I saw this movie on the opening night which was an experience itself. Every wanna-be street racer in Jacksonville who has more money than sense was out front of the theater showing how loud they could rev their engines. Cool. This really is an excellent film about street racers. Incredible racing scenes, an involving plot, but best of all, more gorgeous cars than you can shake a Civic at.  You probably do need some knowledge of cars before you go see this movie, to get the full effect. 9/10 on my scale.",dfashe,"Jun 22, 2001"
3,Not so good,"Not impressed with the writing at all.  The character development was weak and all in all a dissapointing film.  Vin D was good and Paul Walker was somewhat beleivable, but the scene where Walker tell of his undercover ways was just pathetic.....The movie should have been re-written at least 12 more times.  The car scenes were great and the action was solid.  No sequel please..............",kevin.mann-3,"Jun 25, 2001"

8,A nice bit of fluff,"I must admit I had avoided this film for quite a while, then I happened to catch part of the end at a friends place and decided to give it a go. If you are after a film that will make you think while providing you with a new and interesting look at the world, then this is not the film for you. If you want a film that you can just sit down a watch for alittle bit of fun then I say this is it. Because lets face we've seen the plot a thousand times before and it's still as predictable as ever, but the film doesn't pretend to have a twister of a plot it's very clear that cars are it's focal point. It's like every other film, if you walk in with certain expectations that aren't met then you'll be let down. Expect nothing from Fast and the Furious except a laugh and some pretty cars and you will be quite happy. In all a nice bit of fluff.",rockin_robyn19,"Apr 23, 2002"
No rating,ONE FURIOUS THRILL RIDE!,"I haven't been able to get to the movies this summer to see stuff like ""Tomb Raider"" and ""Swordfish"", but I'm glad that caught ""Fast and The Furious"". This was one of the best action movies that I've seen in a long time. This movie had tight cars, good acting, great plot, and continuous action from beginning to end. This tells the story of an undercover cop who has to infiltrate a group of illegal street racers who also may be involved in a highjacking ring. But things get complicated when he develops a close friendship with the leader and falls in love with his sister. I loved every minute of this movie, even Ja Rule's cameo. I also liked the all the racing scenes. This movie is one of the best thrill rides of the summer...and it's a furious thrill ride.",quentin_2006,"Jul 5, 2001"
3,"Sort of enjoyable, but incredibly stupid","This is one of those eye candy type of movies.  Great stunts, special effects, sound and cinematography (and lots of cool cars, if you are into that.)  But the story was a version of the Point Break story, with extra helpings of stupidity and inplausibility.  The characters are VERY thin, which fits right in with the rest of the script.  Amazingly, the DVD of this movie is quite well done, with excellent dts sound and a widescreen video. Lots of extras too, although I didn't bother to look at any of them (like I really want the director's commentary on this crap!)  I give this one a 3/10 for the eye candy, but don't bother to turn on your brain if you watch it. Just enjoy the show.",drsecond,"Feb 25, 2002"
8,Fun Movie With Plenty Of Action,"A fun movie that started a franchise.The story unfolds like an action crime story, and gives us a lot of action scenes and a solid plot. The plot is not complicated, but it doesn't need to be.It's the atmosphere and the characters that matter, and that's done pretty well.The movie is a real movie from the early 2000s that actually works like a 90s action crime movie. That's actually what makes it good because movies like that aren't pretentious, they don't teach us lessons, they're made to entertain us, and that's something The Fast and the Furious certainly succeeds.The cars in the movie are fantastic and anyone who likes fast cars and action will have something to see. They have built and tuned a bunch of cars and they are really fun to see.The stunts are excellent and well directed.Movies from the 90s and early 2000s have a distinct look and feel, and that makes them truly special.A fun, fast-paced movie that's definitely worth watching.",dk777,"Mar 20, 2023"
2,This movie sucks!!!!!!!,"Real quick here, this is pure crap.  I haven't seen anything this bad in quite a while.  The acting was a joke, there was no plot to this testosterone nightmare, and frankly, if action is what you're craving, then by all means, see ""The Matrix"" or ""Last Man Standing"", but steer clear of this mess.",huggy_bear,"Feb 21, 2003"
10,The Best of the Series,"For those who were alive and conscious when this film came out, know how special it was. Now, in 2023, with the new film coming out and them already having visited space in F9 (lmfao), this one becomes even more of a treasure simply because it is REALISTIC. The heart, the story, the characters, the plot twist - we actually related to all those things and felt for the characters. The films after that are contrived and superficial.This is where it all began and this is where the heart of the series will always remain. To the younger audience it may seem corny and of poor quality compared to the CGI used in the subsequent films, but what's grounding here is that most action/car blow ups/car wreck scenes are real, and it takes a true film buff to appreciate that.This movie is more than just an action flick, it is the birth of a family that Dom always talks about. It's nostalgic. It's heroic. It's a gem.",ap-40139-19855,"May 29, 2023"
9,Nostalgia,"This movie was my favorite movie growing up as a kid. Ever since i was little i loved watching this move. This move is a good film to watch if you are into the car scene as much as i am and also if you like the action genre. Paul walker did an amazing job on this movie, this movie is the reason i first got introduced into him. I soon became a fan of his. The scenes are pretty well done although at some parts you cab tell the voice audio was added in after wards. The music was good and always fit the scenes perfectly. This movie in my opinion was the best one in the entire series. The 7th one has a pretty good place in my heart too seeing it was the last film Paul walker worked on before his passing.all i can say is that this movie has aged well and is one of if not my favorite movie of all time",giovannys-78044,"Oct 28, 2015"

5,Doesn't Hold Up,"I was in high school when this came out. Back then I thought it was amazing. Watching it now....you would think that this was a straight to video production. Any scene that involves Paul Walker is just cringe worthy. People always give Keanu Reeves a bad wrap for his acting abilities, but Paul Walker is just terrible in this movie. The only saving grace is the action sequences. I also enjoyed the big brother subplot between Dom and Brian. The acting is what brings this movie down for me. I'll rewatch it in 10 years and reminisce how we used to drive cars ran with gasoline.",volleyer,"Jun 27, 2021"
9,"Fast, Furious, And Freakily Good","You don't have to be a car freak to see this movie, because it'll turn you into one. Forget about story lines, script and reality for a second. Just sit back, and enjoy the ride. Everything in this movie looks good. The cars, the people, even the backdrops. But it manages to pull it off without coming across as too cheesy. It's an unshamefully flash, fast film which deserves to be one of the year's most popular flicks. In two words, ""great fun"". Get yourself down to the cinema now!",rich_jc,"Oct 6, 2001"
4,"As a series newcomer watching for the first time in 2024, I found this surprisingly boring.","For some of this movie's runtime, I found it kind of charming, but it got really tedious at a point. I hope Vin Diesel and Paul Walker get better as the series goes on - both gave kind of awful lead performances here.It probably doesn't help that I find cars boring and street racing stupid. That should be enough to turn me away from a series like Fast and Furious, and it has for 20+ years... but I'm fascinated by the way the series as a whole started small and morphed into something else. It's a progression I want to experience, but starting off with this first movie (as one has to do)... it was rough!The racing scenes are pretty boring, the performances are sometimes pretty bad, and the narrative is a dull kind of ""undercover cop falls for the people he's supposed to take down"" thing that's been done before and done better.Sign me up for the more over-the-top entries that verge away from racing. I think I'll enjoy them more (I saw Fast Five years ago and found it better than this... the only other movie from the series I've seen in isolation is Tokyo Drift, and I remember finding that one more watchable too).So, the original The Fast and the Furious... it's not for me, but I am keen to keep chipping away at this series, because it's been a pop culture blindspot for me for too long. The start of it all proved to be surprisingly lame and boring though, in my opinion.",Jeremy_Urquhart,"May 3, 2024"
9,Great movie!!!!,It's a great movie but something in it reminds me of the old car theft movie with Charlie Sheen (29 seconds??). Doesn't know the English name for it.

No rating,Kept My Motor Running,"The plot and conflict of ""The Fast and The Furious"" is nothing we haven't seen before.  Halfway through I realised two of the leading characters were looking mighty similar to Steve McQueen and Ali Mac Graw in ""The Getaway"". But there was no bitch-slapping here.  The audience cheered when Michelle Rodriguez ""Girlfight"" threw her one and only punch, and she held her own even though her part was minimal.  This movie kept me entertained, gripping my seat, and saying ""wow"".  In an industry filled with CGI effects, this was an action packed stunt movie, and to me there's no comparison between the two.  A great ride.  I really have no complaints, zero.  I don't think anybody went in looking for Shakespeare, and we all left exhilarated.",medfly81,"Jun 23, 2001"

Partially because of the forementioned reasons, but also the camera-techniques and technology surrounding the races are one of a kind!

For one thing Vin Diesel is one of the worst actors to ever walk the face of the earth. Another thing, anyone who watches a movie just to see some nice cars needs to be shot. There really was no story. There was nothing going on. Just car races and stunts. If you watch movies to see fast cars and bad acting then this movie is for you but if you want to see a true piece of art i recommend you stay as far away from this movie as you possibly can.",Sleepless_128,"Aug 13, 2004"
3,"Dude, this movie really sucked!","Sorry to add yet another ""pan"" of this turkey, but it is so bad that it deserves all the abuse that can be heaped on it.The plot isn't even worthy of a WB TV series.  The characters are not developed at all.  One would think that a movie of this ilk would try to explain the racers' motivation, history, basically why they are so fixated on hot-rodding Japanese cars that were intended to be reliable, overpriced, boring transportation for young women (i.e., Honda Civics).Furthermore, to my recollection nearly all the cars raced were front-drivers, making the film's ""Holy Grail"" of a ten second quarter mile ludicrous.

9,The Fast and the Furious indeed!!!,"What a rush! This is the best movie of the summer, without a doubt. Fast cars and hot girls is the main theme of the movie. So the plot may be a bit weak, and some of the lines are tacky, but I'm talking about non stop action. Great stunts and car chase scenes, along with awesome camera angles. They don't ruin the film with any CGI's, it's all real. After leaving the theater the parking lot was roaring, people were gunning their engines and racing off. I wanted to speed out of the theater doing 140mph...a very excited 9/10",jono19,"Jun 23, 2001"
3,The Dull and the Boring,"Why did this become a box office smash?  It has action, it has fast cars and it has no intellectual value whatsoever.  Not to mention, it has Paul Walker and Vin Diesel--who will appeal to the female audience.  OK, so it has the potential to be a slam-bang, entertaining action flick...but I wasn't entertained.  Many will be blown away by the stunts.  But I found them to be far from spectacular.  The movie does keep a fast-pace--almost in the style of an MTV music video--but it can't seem to escape from dullness.  Director Rob Cohen, who has actually directed some good movies in the past, tries too hard to be flashy.  The soundtrack, though full of great songs, is out of whack.  The songs seemed to have been chosen at random.  And of course Cohen felt this is going to appeal to a predominantly young audience, so he jumped at any attempt to insert a song from Ja Rule or any other popular rap artist into each scene, whether it's appropriate or not.As for our two leads, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker--ever consider acting lessons?  The two of them are stiff as a board.  In one scene, Diesel is telling a story about his father's death and he doesn't let out the slightest hint of emotion.  Walker's got the looks, Diesel's got the bod.  I guess that's all they need to qualify!  Standards are getting lower and lower by the minute, in the world of cinema.  Michelle Rodriguez unfortunately has a very small role.  Too bad, because she seems like she has real potential.  I haven't even seen her debut role--which everyone was raving about--in ""Girlfight,"" but she has great ability and a strong presence, and I'm sure she can rise to the top if given the right outlet. BTW, she's also from Jersey City.  Representin'!!!!  The dialogue is downright awful.  The characters are flat.  The plot is far from compelling and sometimes predictable, with tired action cliches planted here and there.  How many movies are we gonna see where the hero ends up falling in love with the villain's sister?And I think the movie would've worked better if it took itself less seriously.  ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" was no gem either, but it was campy and it was meant to be campy.  And it was done with a tongue-in-cheek approach, with some very funny moments of comic relief.  ""The Fast and the Furious"" actually tries to be A-class entertainment, but it doesn't even deserve to be in the D-class.  There are some nice shots of scantily clad babes, and that's the only reason why I'm not giving this movie a rating of 1.  If you're an automobile fanatic or is this is simply your kind of entertainment, have fun.  If not...be prepared for the Dull and the Boring.  My score:  3 (out of 10)",mattymatt4ever,"Feb 1, 2002"

No rating,"I really enjoyed this movie. Action, romance and high speeding cars are a must see.","I thought the comments on this movie were not really fair to all those fast cars movie lovers (I must include myself as one).

2,The Fast and the Fatuous,"I think I lasted about 40 minutes before I ejected the vid. Sexy men are not enough for a movie, and I wasn't that interested in the fast cars.

10,THIS NOW FALLS INTO THE NOSTALGIA REALM,My car club was asked to help premier this movie at our local regal cinema. We were parked on the sidewalk right in front of the box office. There was so much hype. It was electric and the crowds were loving the idea of the cars to go along with the premier. The movie was and still is amazing. We helped premier the next several movies when we were in the area and not showing up and down the east coast. Those were great times and this movie embodies that.,Dhouser809,"Nov 13, 2018"

8,Very interesting movie with a lame script,"This was a compelling movie with interesting characters that suffered from a lame script.  It was fragmented and full of cliches both in dialogue and scenes---sort of a composite of trite subplots.  However, Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, and Michelle Rodriquez provided some spark.  Brewster is too beautiful and had some pretty sappy lines, but she was fun to look at. The cars and race scenes were cool.  The plot could have been good except for the stupid denouement which once again had some good action scenes based on lame ideas.",barhydt,"Apr 19, 2002"
No rating,The best movie on the shelf,"WARNING- DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE..IT REVEALS SUPRISES THAT YOU DONT WANT SPOILED..!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!(this warning is required by IMDB in order to place a review)Fast and the furious is about an undercover detective(Walker)who is trying to make his way into the underground street racing world becouse some trucks have been getting hijacked by cars that have police believing belong to some people in the street racing circut. Now along the way he befriends the ""MAN"" of the street racing word (Diesel) named Domonic Torreto. Now the detective has become friends wth torreto and starts denying the fact it could be torreto who is hijacking the trucks. Now he also falls for torretos sister Mia along the way movie. AND THE CARS!!! The cars are awesome. So i say this is a deffanite 10. This isan action based film with a touch of romance and a very little bit of mystery. But i loved his movie and feel It was one of the best of 2001. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone. The action is faced pace and i like how it was realistic in talking and emotions and all that. The roles were very beleivable and the acting was good. The bad guys are hard to tell at first but you know by mid movie. The only thing that could make the movie better is if a video game came out about it. But overall Fast and the furious is a definate hit.",ExtremeGMR2,"Jan 21, 2002"
5,Mediocre at best,"I'm watching the whole series (I only saw 1 and 2 when younger). I liked it for what it was when I was 15 or something, but even then I knew it wasn't particularly good.Besides the awful acting and mediocre at best dialogue, I have to say It was good (just that, good) for a while. All the set-up was fun, even if dumb of course, and the 2nd act was good, creating tension for Paul Walker's character.And then... they dropped the ball. They made a scene that could've cut a lot of boring minutes of this movie, and justify the ending at the same time and yet they keep going, wasting all the tension just to have a stupid last motivation for the characters to be where the writers wanted them to be. All this in pursuit of an unnecessary and overlong ""Hollywood"" 3rd act that deflated it for me. Overall, I think it's ok for what it was trying to do.",eddmurua,"May 17, 2024"
8,Now this is what I call entertainment,"First of all: The Fast and The Furious does not have a good story. The plot is very thin and the dialogues are terrible. Now, the question rises: is it therefore a bad movie ? The answer (for me)is NO! The main reason why this is quite a good movie is the MTV ish style in wich this movie is recorded. The style is fast, with a couple of very nice camera movements. besides that, this movie offers great cars, great action and a fine soundtrack. Therefore, this movie offers exactly what it pretends: great, non complex entertainment.So, if you are looking for a movie without a very complex storyline, but with great visuals and great entertaining value, this is the one.8.5/10,",adrian-87,"May 30, 2002"

9,One of my favorites films of all time,"The Fast and The Furious 
 After watching every single Fast and Furious movie in the series thus far, I can say for sure that the very first original Fast and Furious movie is still the best. The story goes from undercover cop trying to find illegal street racers robbing trucks of millions of dollars in electronics to the undercover cop growing close to the racers and trying to help them get away from the cops.
 This movie is very fast paced and an in your face thrill. The stunts they do with the cars are incredible and keep you very engaged and waiting for what's to come. All of the characters in the film are easy to relate to and makes you wonder which character you would be if you were in the film. The best duo is Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. In the beginning they are enemies hunting each other but by the end they are good friends helping each other out.
 Being a car guy myself, I have always loved car movies but this one just never goes away. I'm not sure if it's the action-packed scenes filled with police chases or the realistic street races that keep you on the edge of your seat. Although there are some insane car stunts in this film, the street races are very real and show how sometimes street racing goes good and sometimes it goes horribly wrong.
 The only thing about this film that I didn't like was some of the cars. Nearly all of the cars used were your typical European import cars. They could have branched out to some cars that many people don't see as often, and I would have been even more interested in the cars.
 There is truly something for everyone to enjoy in this movie even if you aren't a car person. There is thrills, action, love, hate, adrenaline, and a little bit of everything. I have watched this film with lots of different people and I have yet to hear any of them say they didn't like it because they can easily connect with one of the characters.
This movie got me hooked on horsepower at a very young age and still to this day whenever someone asks me what movie I want to watch, I always say The Fast and the Furious. Every time I watch this movie, my adrenaline starts pumping every time there is a racing scene and by the end I just want to go jump in car and race! 
All in all, this is one of my favorite movies of all time and I will never get tired of watching it. I highly recommend this film to anyone, especially if you like street racing and/or import cars.",hembreedg,"Oct 9, 2018"
8,Modern day classic,"This was a decent original movie that launched the career of Vin Diesel. This movie came out during a period where Hollywood was releasing remakes and disaster movies.

No rating,It serves it's purpose,"The thing about a movie like ""The Fast And The Furious"" is that you can't really trash it too much. Why? Because it is everything that is stated on the label. Look at the cover of the DVD. That is what you get. An Gen-Y action movie starring cars, Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, and more cars. It's fast. It's furious. Sure, many plot-holes appear and the movie seems to take a little too much liberty with the plot (a lot of loose-ends) but the movie is fun. It serves it's purpose by providing pure escapism. As someone who HATES reality-tv, it's nice to pop in a movie like this, kick back, and forget my problems for 110 minutes. The movie moves fluidly and just as fast as the cars do. The plot, despite having many flaws, is extremely strong for it's type. Basically, Paul Walker plays an undercover cop who is trying to bust a group of hijackers to earn his ticket into the FBI. He hits the streets to blend in as a street racer and try to nose out who is behind the job. He gets close to the top-street racer Dominic (Vin Diesel) and soon he is faced with the decision of keeping true to his pal, or ratting him out for his chance at the career he has always dreamed of. It's basically a pop-corn movie. Don't hold too much too it. As long as you can get over the lapses in logic -- Why didn't the trucker just stop, reload his gun, and shoot Vince? Because it makes for an adrenaline pumping action sequence (that's why!) -- you'll find yourself enjoying this movie.7/10",Incubus_Reborn,"Jun 16, 2003"
4,Jon Monsarrat review: worse than Gone in 60 Seconds,"I like action movies. If stuff is blowing up and there's some hand-to-hand combat, who cares if there's a plot?This one, though, is really bad -- cheesy but unlike Conan the Barbarian not in a good way, and takes itself too seriously. The stunts are not interesting enough to make up for it.As a sample: why do the badguys drive cars that glow with green lights?Who should see this film:-- Those whose favorite film was Gone in 60 Seconds-- car racing buffs who've heard their favorite car is in the movie-- those who like the action in TV wrestlingI'll give it a 4 out of 10 which is generous in my opinion.",johnnymonsarrat,"Mar 29, 2002"

8,The beginning of reckless fun.,"Ever since the first Fast & Furious films came out, I never had a look at them like they're untouched new millennium movie gems. Back in April 2015, I've seen Fast & Furious 7 and instantly loved it so much that it's favourite movie of that year! When that movie became a monstrous box-office smash, I have planned to watch the whole franchise from the very beginning. With that said, It's time to review The Fast and the Furious, a solid start of the movie franchise ride!In the movie, we have the legendary Paul Walker and Vin Diesel who both did fantastic performances throughout. I also have to mention that the variety of tuned cars in this movie is pretty unique. We have the Supra, the Civic and more which can be perfect for car lovers (like me). Speaking of cars, the car chases and races are quite fun to watch. Although there were less than I expect but it's still fitting. The music by BT is another thing that fits well in the movie, as well as the songs. They give us the music theme of tuned car racing. Finally, the pace is in an acceptable speed of over 100 mins, just the way I like it.Now that I watched Fast & Furious 1 & 7, the journey goes on as we head on to 2 Fast 2 Furious! If you haven't seen the films and if you like to watch them, hop in the car and get ready to burn rubber!Film Score: 8/10 - Great",bigconoruk,"Jun 5, 2015"

1,Simply Put One Of the Worst Movies Of All Time,"Here is a brief summary of the movie: Take a bunch of complete idiots off the street give them the keys to some cool looking cars have them drive them around for a few hours and throw in some crappy dialogue in between.Boy it is beyond me on how crap like this gets made. The story didn't make sense, the dialogue was horrible, acting also horrible, and there were many mistakes throughout the film. I respect other peoples opinions on this movie however different they may be from my own, but some of the reasons people like this movie to me are completely stupid. If you are planning on reviewing this movie please base your opinions on something substantial no I dont mean, ""Dude those cars are cool.""In conclusion don't see this movie I swear I felt myself getting dumber ever second I was infront of the movie screen.",customrig,"Jun 29, 2002"
9,"Hot, Spicy, and Furiously Fast","When the movie started, I was grab into the movie. The vision, Paul Walker, and the cast was dramatic. Everything was perfect, but the only problem was that I thought that the movie was cut and cut so much that the movie wasn't exactly portray liked I thought it was. I knew the plot, but the people who edit this movie cut out so many wonderful parts and takes that the movie was more liked rated G (no sex just a bunch of drama). One comment, PAUL WALKER looks good!! Really good!!!! He was the part that made me came to see this film!! My friends were screaming and yelling, ""He's so hot"" during the movie!! I couldn't stopped them from disrupting the others who were there. The cars were phat! What I don't liked about it was how it portray the Asian people. We're not liked that!! WE're not slutty, pervert, nor  evil (well, most of us aren't). That was the only part I was offended by. The way they made the Asian people dress was so entirely gross. I mean I can't even think they think we're liked that!! Anyways, the movie went by so fast, I didn't even see Paul Walker get any ""action"" with Jordana Brewster. It was a shame that the writers didn't really get into the ""Brian Mia's relationship"" because I thought that that was an interesting ""part"" to know. Well, anyway, the movie was awesome, the cars were da bomb, and it has incredible special effect. For those that didn't saw it, go see it for the action, cars, or my personal favorite, Paul Walker. He look so hot and so damn sexy in that movie!! He will totally take your breathed away!!!",baon_08,"Jul 8, 2001"

Some of the dumbasses I know have tried in vain to defend this crappy film by using excuses like ""the car chases were cool and the chicks were hot!"" If I want to see car chases I'll just watch Nascar and if I want to see hot chicks I'll just pick up a victoria secret catalog, and then I won't have to sit through an insufferable piece of crap that's not even worth the film it's printed on.",Jedi Scissorhands,"Jun 27, 2002"

You have to be in the right frame of mind:  If you can check your brain in at the door and just want to sit back, relax, and watch things crash, this is a fine summer popcorn movie.  Vin Diesel is on a good streak (after Saving Private Ryan, The Iron Giant, Pitch Black, and The Boiler Room) and it will be interesting to see what comes next.  ***",JRColvin,"Aug 2, 2001"
No rating,"I Wasn't Supposed To Like This,But I Did!","Anyone who sits down to watch this movie should be looking for 2 hours of pure,forget your problems,entertainment.  Shakespeare it ain't!  However, it is a loud,action-packed diversion and it is lots of fun.  And I,being long out of my teens and a Detroit muscle car enthusiast to boot,wasn't supposed to like it!The plot is a bit on the thin side,but it is basically just an excuse to bombard the viewer with a cool,thumping soundtrack and lots of shiny,fast,little cars.  I found myself liking these characters,particularly the girls.  Both Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriquez did a fine job as very strong young women,each in her own way.  Vin Diesel was likeable as a character that was reminiscent of a Hollywood version of Jesse James or Robin Hood.  Paul Walker did well in his portrayal of the young undercover cop,who is torn between love and duty. I also found Chad Lindberg's portrayal of Jesse,the young genius whose potential is never fully realized,to be touching.  Certainly,having the talented Ted Levine aboard,as the voice of reason,lent an air of credibility to the whole proceedings. This man always shines,even in the smallest roles.Some of the plot was disturbing,such as the treatment of truck drivers,but it was apparent that the world of modern day street racing was well researched,by writers and actors alike.  The terminology was up to the minute and if all else fails,just holler,""NOS!""

4,A teenage punk kid's wet dream,"The Fast and the Furious, I remember in 2001 this was the must see movie. I was in high school at the time and I remember the weekend that it opened strangely enough, and I remember the Monday at school, all the guys were just screaming how cool this film was, how ""badass"" it was, it was so ridicules. So, I decided to steer clear of the fast and the furious films, it just seemed like a waste of time. But recently one of my friends told me that I should give these movies a chance. So I decided to go ahead and see what they were about, plus I had a coupon for a free rental and there was nothing else better to watch it seemed. So I watched the first two fast and the furious films this afternoon, and for the first film, I have to say that it lived up to everything I would've expected.Brian is a cop in LA and is going undercover into the deep dark pimp my ride world of street racing. He meets the head of the LA races, Dominic, who has a gang of people who are loyal drivers and race for money, also a sister who Brian falls for, what a shock, huh? But there's bad news, there is a rival race gang in the area, The Fast And The Furious became quickly from an action movie to a mystery thriller of who's gang is trying to get the major pimp your ride engines for money. So Brian of course starts to like the gang and wants to become one of them, what another shock.When it comes down to it The Fast and the Furious is the most predictable and horribly written piece of a film you could think of. I don't understand how others, besides a teenage guy, could get into these films. I shouldn't have rented the sequels, just because now I have to watch them to get my money's worth :P But I think it is just silly all the major over the top special effects, it has a pointless plot as well as it's sexist. I'm not saying that to be a pain in the butt, but all the women in this film were used as mostly sex objects, they had no development. But I guess that's what to expect from a film like The Fast and the Furious. Oh, well, at least I could say I saw these films.4/10",Smells_Like_Cheese,"Nov 30, 2007"
8,Fast and Fun!!!,"An awesome mix of cars, actors, and excitement.  If you like cars, you will be impressed to see the variety this movie provides.  From new imports to old hot rods, this movie has it all!  Plan on calling a cab after this movie, the roads will be crawling with ""street racers"" in training.",blossom_rose21,"Jun 25, 2001"
9,Not just the cars....,"In this movie, I enjoyed not only the cars, but the men as well. Vin Diesel steals the movie from Paul Walker. Walker still makes out in the movie. This movie does NOT suck. The actresses in this movie are lucky to have been able to work with Vin and Paul.",ValandVin,"Aug 29, 2002"
1,It was good the first time I saw it...,"...when it was called Point Break.  Paul Walker is by far one of the worst actors ever and the only difference between this movie and Point Break was cars over surfboards...next time be creative.  If they have time to change the name for the sequel, I have a good idea, ""The Poorly Written and Predictable.""",indoflea,"Dec 11, 2002"
8,"Not the best, but pretty great start","The Fast and the Furious has been established as one of the most popular and ambitious movie franchises in history - showcasing a memorable cast of characters, astonishing action set pieces and a fun lighthearted tone, it is rivaled perhaps only by the MCU or Star Wars as one of the most long lived and continuingly solid series.Admittedly, it gets far better in the later installments, with action scenes and effects that could only have been dreamed of - but this initial entry was a very solid start regardless.It isn't a very story driven piece, and it doesn't set out to be (though later films focused a bit more on that), yet it's very fun and memorable, and gives great motivation to the suspenseful and fast paced action scenes.Overall, a great film with incredible effects and cinematography that started out a very fun franchise. Just don't take it all too seriously!",martinpersson97,"Apr 20, 2023"
1,A scandalous praise of dangerous antisocial behaviour,"I saw this movie in sneak preview, otherwise I wouldn't have bothered watching it.I didn't expect a lot of it... it was even worse.The whole movie does nothing else than giving people the idea that purpously putting other people in danger can be in any way justified.I know several people who have lost relatives to a-holes driving dangerously fast just for the heck of it, and this piece of crap is nothing else than an insulting kick in the face to their pain.To add insult to injury, the story was worthless and the ""acting"" doesn't deserve the name.only one possible rating: zip.",Seeker-11,"Sep 21, 2001"

I'm not the biggest racing movie fan, but i loved the movie.  Its a great movie, and well worth the 9$ i paid to see it.  The only thing i can honestly say that disappointed me about the movie was that it was a little too obvious where they cut a scene or two... but it didnt take away from the movie that much.",D.

1,I cannot fathom why people like this piece of tripe,"Without a doubt, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The dialogue is horrendous, the characters are woefully under-developed and nothing was believable about the entire movie. The best way to describe this movie is that it is movie with cars upon which someone tried to add a plot. However, they failed miserably. The ending is absolutely implausible, for there are no reasons to justify it. We have no reason to accept the behavior of the main characters or their reactions/bonds with each other. I do like the various actors that had the misfortune or lack of common sense to be in this picture, but that is just not enough. So many people loved this movie and while it is possible to restrain myself from arguing with them, I find it very difficult and taxing since this movie was total garbage. I am sure I like movies they do not like, and to each their own, but for me, it just doesn't get much worse!",joshuastephen4,"Jun 10, 2002"
8,"The Fast and the Furious was so good, I felt the need to register and share my views of the movie, thats how good it is","Don't let anyone fool you, the Fast and the Furious is a wonderfully entertaining movie. If you saw the trailer and though that it looked like a fun roller coaster ride styled action movie then you are absolutely correct. The best summation you could give of the film is that its like two hours of what you see in the trailer. It's seriously one of the most accurately advertised and needless to say one of the most fun and entertaining movies of the year.The racing scenes have been cleverly filmed and edited together in a way that gives you a false sense of motion with lots of first person views as cars race down the street. In addition, just about every scene in the movie looks really sharp thanks to nice lighting, some visual effects, and just plain good camera work. The direction of camera work for the most part is very traditional in the sense that each major scene is proceeded by a few seconds of a `set up' shot that gives you a feeling for the size and surroundings of a scene locale. The majority of the dialogue shots and racing shots are of course third person, however, many of these shots are extremely tight giving you a very strong sense of being there.
Vin Diesel's performance is convincing and very entertaining. He's extremely enigmatic and seems to have that quality that some actors like Bruce Willis have. That quality of coming off as being an extremely cool person who you just know you'd be best friends with. Paul Walker's performance while somewhat wooden, really isn't bad at all. In fact if you really stopped and thought about his character's motivation Paul's on screen apprehension and uncertainty early in the film actually fits his character. Stack that up against his wide eyed and completely commanding on screen presence toward the end of the film and you've got the complete emotional stages of his character that realistically depicts a man in his situation. The rest of the main cast really deserves a lot of credit too. Sure they might not be a lot well known actors, but I'd have to imagine that a few of them will be after a few casting agents see this movie since there really isn't a bad performance in the movie.The writing and dialogue is fairly decent. Sure it isn't the most original story ever, but it does a great job of delivering a plot through the use of a lot of action. The dialogue while a bit awkward a couple of times is for the most part well done.In the end, you won't be disappointed in The Fast and the Furious if you like action movies, cars, or Vin Diesel. The story is decent, the sound and visuals are fantastic, and you'll walk out of the theater with a big smile and the undying urge to drive really reckless while listening to loud music. The PG-13 rating is a very liberal one by the way, people shoot and are shot by guns on screen, some language, some slight skin, but since the movie moves so fast and is so loud, you really think you hear and see more than you actually do. Great movie!",ironmacd,"Jun 23, 2001"
1,A turd with wheels,"I am amazed that this movie has managed to pull a 6.2 on the IMDB average! What a piece of garbage.  Horrible acting, stupid gen-x extreme sports nonsense, and a bunch of fast but hideous cars make this a real stinker.  If you want a car movie, at least have one where the cars look halfway decent, as opposed to a bunch of tacky colors and splash graphics.  It was about like watching the demo at the front of a poor racing video game.",lngjon,"Jul 30, 2002"
No rating,I loved it...,"When I first saw the previews, I thought it sounded like another lousy car movie. The only reason I went is because I love movies and my brother and my cousins wanted to see it so I went along. I came out of the theater happy that I had gone in. I enjoyed the movie. The action is awesome, the actors were great, and the movie was overall fun. If you're into cars or you just want to go to a fun movie, this is a great one to go to. Don't over analyze it, it's just for entertainment.",Ferret_17,"Jun 24, 2001"
8,An unexpected surprise,"""The Fast and the Furious"" is a movie that surprised me big time because I didn't think I would like it. It didn't look all that great when I saw the previews of it, and I was dreading that I would have a miserable time watching it when some friends talked me into seeing the film with them. By the end of it, I was incredibly surprised at how much I liked this movie. It's not one of the best movies ever made, but it kept me interested from start to finish. ""The Fast and the Furious"" is about drag racing in L.A., and focuses on a young undercover cop who falls into a group of professional drag racers who just might be the same ones who've been participating in a series of truck hijackings. The young cop tries to get to the bottom of this by becoming close friends with the leader of this group. Here for once is a movie that features car races and chases with the use of real cars, not special effects. It's at its best when the action takes place behind the wheel, and these scenes keep you on the edge. Plus, it has a story that works because it's interesting. Paul Walker (as the cop) and Vin Diesel (as the group leader) are given good material to work with, and both actors play their characters well. You get to know these two guys, and you can't help but wonder what's going to happen to them in the end. That makes ""The Fast and the Furious"" an even better film. Good acting, good story, and good action make this film a surprise winner.*** (out of four)",jhaggardjr,"Jul 29, 2001"
10,Better the second around!,"I just recently saw this movie again when I rented.  When I first reviewed this movie, I gave it a A-.  Now, this is still good, but, it's better if you watch it again.  What I forgot to add from my first review of this movie is that movie has great special effects, a great soundtrack, and great music (composed by BT, who would also compose music for ""Driven,"" ""Go,"" and ""Under Suspicion.""  If you're in need of a good movie and great-looking cars and wonderful cast (the great Vin Diesel), then check this movie out.  Also, the ending was still pretty lame.

1,The WORST,"I know that no all the people like the same. I'm fan of horror movies (most of the people can't stand the good horror movies) and I have to discuss about it very often. I understand that there is people that doesn't like this kind of cinema... But please, the movie we are talking about is, from an objective point of view, bad. The only thing that I can accept from the movie are the cars... and I'm not fan of the cars... so, no much interest for me. So, I don't like the cars (but accept that beautiful cars are there), the plot is miserable, the acting is pathetic... the movie itself isn't good. So my question: Why does it have today (21 Oct 2001) 6.7? I think that the people who have vote... like the cars and that is enough for them to give TO the movie a 10... AND IT IS  UNFORGIVABLE. Well now a personal opinion. I'm fan of Depeche Mode... and in this movie is the worst cover of STRANGELOVE... a beautiful song that have been injured by this movie (or the singer who made the cover...)

8,Action junkies and thrill seekers apply here.,"As night falls on the streets of L.A., souped up cars, driven by souped up kids, illegally race at incredible speeds. That alone is more than enough to keep the cops busy, but it appears that a number of robberies on moving trucks could well be the work of the speed racers. Time for someone to go undercover, someone with a flair for speed and daring do heroics.........The title says it all actually, from the very first sequence to the pulsating ripper of a finale, this film really is fast and furious. Dumb in substance and morally dubious in to the bargain, it is however one of the finest exponents of the action/thriller/crime genre of modern times. Owing certain debts to Point Break and Stone Cold, director Rob Cohen has crafted a technically adroit picture which is an assault on the eyes and the ears. Cars tear around, crash bang and wallop, thru the camera, under trucks, in front of speeding trains and on it goes, with no real let up till the end credits roll. There is a plot, it's thin, but it does have a story from which to race around. The cast flex their muscles and pout respectively, with a little bit of eye candy for either sexes to admire from their comfy chairs. Boasting great stunt work mixed in with very capable CGI, The Fast And The Furious deserves much better regard than it currently has on some internet sites. Why? Because it does what it tells you it will do from the title, and as dumb as it is, it's the best kind of dumb to loose yourself with. 8/10",hitchcockthelegend,"Apr 28, 2009"

It's way, way better than the second F and F.Of course, Paul Walker and Vin Diesel contrast each other. Vin is a big guy and Paul isn't so big...this makes Paul look like a ferocious chihuahua and Diesel a giant rottweiler.I recommend this movie for every Vin Diesel fan, and everyone that is a fan of fast cars.Another thing about this movie was that it was so popular that the police had to actually do more work to keep the kids from speeding.Anyway, the Fast and the Furious is for you if you like action, romance, mystery, and adventure...",green-diamond,"Mar 14, 2006"
9,simplify things just a bit,"One word...FORMULA. This is Hollywood. Break it down and it is simply a western plot with cars races substituted for drawing guns, 18-wheelers for stagecoaches, and a whole lotta ""this town ain't big enough for the two of us"". Anyone expecting an original plot must be oblivious as to the state of American film. Accept it for what it is and be fortunate that it is lacking in pretensions. It is not titled, ""leisurely-paced, intellectually stimulating plot with rice burners"". It is FAST and it is FURIOUS, delivering what it promises.The movie is founded in reality, whether the movie-speak comes across accurately or not; this culture exists across the US. Rent the DVD to read the article the script was conceived from and see more details about this particular group of people. The ability to take your mothers leftover civic and dump a few grand under the hood, resulting in power and freedom, unites many different races and cultural identities in the street racing world. Even within the one ?team? in this movie there are several different cultural groups identified including women, Latino, African-American, redneck, and WASP.Rob Cohen has succeeded in creating a movie where the cars are given life. They are characters in the film along with the actors. And for those complaining of realism, a majority of the cars used in the movies are real cars raced by their owners who were extras in the movie, thus, one must conclude that this must be based in some sort of mechanical reality?But hey, that's just my take on it.",shea-8,"Feb 21, 2002"

1,Terrible movie and really stupid.,"This movie is stupid and the people in it don't know any thing about cars for when you shift you lose power not gain power. This is a poorly done movie just for the people that think that foreign cars are the best and fastest. This a sad excuse for a movie I think. The people really don't know how to drive or control the All-American cars so they have to go to little foreign cars with no power at all. This movie is just not very good, and any all the real All- American car lover would say that it's not very good and stupid. I think that ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" is a way better movie than this.

1,"""I need NOS, lots of NOS cuz my car has no engine""","What can I say? Slow cars, bad acting, terrible music, and cheezy looking action scenes. First off, there is nothing ""fast"" or ""furious"" about a Honda or any of these tacky looking cars. The only decent cars in the movie are the Ferrari, F150 Lightnig, and the supercharged Charger. The day when an old $3k RX7 can beat a $140k V12 Ferrari will be the day cows fly. The acting was terrible. It's like watching a movie with robots. There is no character development and they are all about as lively as stones. The music is just terrible for an action movie and the actions scenes have absolutely nothing realistic about them. It is quite apparent that no one involved in the making of this film has ever been to or knows anything about drag racing or cars.

10,Great film for what it was,"Sometimes I'm constantly amazed to read reviews by people who have so obviously gone to a movie they either didn't want to watch or knew wouldn't really interest them. To these people, I say give your money to charity or something, I've never understood those people who have so little to do in their life that they go and see every movie ever made then complain about 90% of them. Life is like that, I happen to think Star Wars sucks, so when a new Star Wars movie comes out, you know what?! I DON'T go and see it! TF&TF is like this. For those who enjoy cars...no let me rephrase that, for those who love cars, this is a great film. It really makes ""Gone in 60 seconds"" look like an excuse of a car film - they raid a Ferrari garage and we see about 5 seconds of actual DRIVING? WHAT WERE THEY THINKING! Not so in The Fast and The Furious, thankfully. The riced out cars may not be to everyone's tastes, but owning a powerful turbo vehicle myself, they actually captured my imagination with the audio - the vehicles sounded immaculate with audible induction noise, blow off valves and sweet exhaust notes throughout the movie. The black muscle-car near the end of the movie absolutely thundered in Dolby delight in my cinema, and was awe inspiring. With a decent home theatre setup at home, not much impresses me these days but I was blown away by the audio at most times in this film. It reminded me why I still bother going to the cinema. Visually the movie was fine, the stunts were well executed and the camera angles engaging. You don't go to an action movie to see involving dialog, you go to remove yourself from reality and have a damn good time doing it, and I felt TF&TF did this well. The fact it was about a subject close to my heart (cars) just added to my personal like for the film. My wife, who dislikes a lot of films I enjoy, also loved the film - which surprised me seeing it was so obviously a male oriented film. Yes the plot was a bit weak, the dialog a bit shabby at times, and the acting a bit forced. The corny ""I live my life a quarter mile at a time"" was almost laughable, but taken in context was bearable. But at the end of the day, this was a fantastic movie for car freaks - the same crowd who will spend $50 on specialised videos JUST about cars, with no plot, no Dolby surround, no multi-million dollar budget. If you take this movie for what it is, a fast action romp around the car racing scene, then it does its job admirably IMHO. I think those thoughts are backed up by the huge haul it has done at the box office, and I'm even thinking of seeing it again, something I've not done since I was a stupid teenager :) Go see it, and grab it on DVD - I know I will.",Rextacy,"Sep 24, 2001"

No rating,WHAT A RUSH!!!,"You know, I've been noticing a trend.  These past few summers, at least one action flick stands above the rest.  ""The Matrix"" for 1999 and ""X-Men"" for 2000.  After seeing this, without a doubt, ""The Fast and the Furious"" is THE best action film of Summer 2001!I began my weeklong vacation in New York just before the weekend this movie was released.  I was lucky enough to catch one of the first showings with a bunch of my cousins from all over the country.  We were having a family reunion that weekend and we agreed that ""F&F"" was the film we needed to see as part of our celebration of togetherness.  And in light of the fact that we were all guys (not to say that girls won't enjoy this film), we all knew we were in for a real treat because the movie deals with one subject of fascination to many young males: street racing.The opening highspeed carjacking sequence showed us that everything from then on would be pure hype and adrenaline.  It didn't seem to me that this film has a solid plot, save for the storyline of actor Paul Walker's character and his mission to probe and catch the carjackers from the opening scene.  But that hardly matters if you came to see this movie for pure popcorn entertainment.  If you worship cars and love beautiful babes, then you'll love ""F&F""!Through intense and often exhilarating speeding visuals, director Rob Cohen does a great job in giving the audience a first-hand experience of what it is like to actually sit behind the wheel, turn on the engine, and literally go VROOOMMMMM!!!!!The actors perform pretty well with their tough but enjoyable attitudes. Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez are perfect and sexy as the girlfriends of Walker and Vin Diesel, respectively.  Diesel has such a formidable and commanding onscreen presence, and I'm sure that the box office success of ""F&F"" will only further catapult him to Hollywood superstar status.  And rapper Ja Rule has a short but memorable cameo appearance as a contestant in the film's first superhype drag race sequence.
For its amazing street racing and the coolest cars on the planet that I've ever seen, I vote for ""F&F"" to be the must-see action flick of 2001.  To those other so-called ""racer"" films like ""Days of Thunder"" and ""Gone in 60 Seconds,"" I've only got this to say: EAT YOUR HEART OUT!",jagaforce,"Sep 10, 2001"

10,Best of the Series! No question!,"I'm surprised this has one of the lowest ratings of the series!
What makes me love this film above all the others? Well, there's a few things:This is the original, the best! Before Hollywood took it and threw into unrealistic scenarios and laughable over the top action sequences.This movie at its core is about friendship and the close bonds the main characters hold for one another. Lengths a person will go to for those they love.It keeps things simple, street racing, robbery, fist fights and racial feuds. Why do audiences need cars jumping from high rise to high rise and over the top villains with pointless back stories and agenda's?It's realistic (to a degree) has impressive actor chemistry, makes you care for the characters and their close bonds. Fun storyline, high stress action sequences. You really don't need more to create a great film, if written and executed correctly.On a side note I will say, at this time of his career, Paul Walker, cannot act. Thankfully he improved on his talents as he worked in the series more and more. Which is more than you can say for a lot of ""pretty"" men landing high profile film roles in the industry today.10/10 loved it 18years ago and love it still. You cannot beat the classic, the original The Fast & The Furious.",lita-ann88,"Jan 18, 2019"
3,The best of the worst,"The Fast and Furious series is brain-dead and shallow in plot, yet this is the best of them. However in typical early 2000's movie making, they focus too much on the action, corny cliche lines used for the promos and a pointless love plot and disregard anything that resembles character development or a narrative.The female characters have no use in this movie. It's all part of being PC. The. Brian-Mia subplot was unnecessary and, if removed, would have made the movie better and no one would have questioned why there wasn't a love interest. The doting looks at the camera/Brian are cringeworthy at best, too.Same goes with Letty. She barely says a word throughout the movie and is simply there to get out of a car, look cool and make a partially-sexy pose for the slo-mo camera shot. Pointless.I know this was written by a car magazine 'journalist', but surely he knew what was cliche and could have avoided it or at least added something that we hadn't seen in every other 'fast' action movie aimed at 20somethings?",yorktown_hawk,"Jan 21, 2022"

8,A Good Popcorn Movie,"My Rating: *** out of ****. Its safe to say the Fast and the Furious is not an intelligent movie. However, that does not mean it is not entertaining. This is definitely escapist entertainment, or a popcorn movie like many people like to call them. Vin Diesel is impressive, he has a presence when on screen and he doesnt screw up when delivering his lines. This performance elevated him into stardom and I can definitely see why. Paul Walker is only adequate though, he pales when hes next to Diesel. Jordana Brewster makes Mia into a very appealing character. Michelle Rodriguez is once again playing a tough girl. Rick Yune is effective as the bad guy. Fast and the Furious does have a few bad lines but that is expected in some summer movies. Mostly the dialogue is fine. The car races and chases are well shot.

Neither as fast nor as furious as the title implies or as the later films (though the failed truck robbery is harrowing & character driven), it truly establishes the family vibe so often referenced later on, & the bro-y, sweaty chemistry is surprisingly strong.",matthewssilverhammer,"Jul 14, 2018"
4,Not all that good.,This is my first time diving into this series and we begin with the very first movie.Unfortunately this wasn't all that great.The story was boring. The acting was mediocre at best.Kind of makes me scared to see the rest of this trilogy.,keyshawn-51559,"Apr 30, 2022"

8,weirdly one of my favs,"I have a weird love for this movie. Maybe its the fact that I grew up re watching this it with my siblings, but after years of the Fast and The Furious franchise this is the movie that gave us the most. The new movies, where all of these characters seem to be invisible and in most occasions gravity does not apply to them suck. In my opinion The Fast franchise should've ended after Paul Walker's passing. In a way it felt weird to watch the following movies after his untimely passing. All in all this movie will always be one of my favorites, even when it is not the greatest.",marwillreview,"Jun 17, 2021"
10,the classic that started all,"This movie embodies the tuning and custom subculture that already existed in the 90s, so vin diesel being the petrolhead and his gang, and paul walker as the newcorner who learns about cars. Is perfect, the movie not only shows the drag races that already everybody knows, shows that custom cars were part of alot of people, being a movie obviusly theres a cop and bad guys plot, but the movie is better when u enjoy the fact they used many cars that custom people already know and the action is fun.",Cinema2kMendoza,"Sep 20, 2021"
4,Technically and Ethically Flawed,"Rather than just bashing this film (albeit well deserved) let me start with the good points. 'The Fast and the Furious' has good production values, cinematography, and performances. The director does a decent job at maintaining pace and the story does offer some character development. Where this movie hurts itself is: 1) Apparent lack of a technical consultant. In the first race scene, Walker's car begins spewing nuts, bolts, and washers from the dashboard (?). Apparently he has plenty of spare parts in places they should not be. In the same race he burns out his cylinders and yet is still able to outrun the police. This movie is filled with such technical flaws (I won't even mention hitting a semi head on and walking away without a scratch); 2) The good guys are a crooked cop and a thief who hijacks trucks. The bad guys are truckers who defend themselves and Asians.; 3) The film-makers should have seriously set aside their own prejudice.-- Although the technical inaccuracies frankly will not bother many at all (hey, if it's entertaining, why not), it's basic asinine concept of protagonists and it's expressed prejudice make it something I cannot recommend. There are several stellar reviews for this movie on this page that rate this movie as good to great. Just take a look at the number of copies of this DVD which are available and the cheap asking price. This should give you an indication that this is a movie you will not want to see again and that at least a few of the stellar reviews are from people wanting to get rid of their copy.",Ariel_Ronnie,"Oct 14, 2008"
9,Pretty Good If You Ask Me,"i have seen the three movies; so i know what i'm talking about. although Tokyo Drift had the best story, i have to give it to One. it sparked the whole thingI'm down with the bad plot, even i felt that.but that doesn't stop the movie from being totally cool, it's as simple as that.sometimes, i think all i care about is racing scenes, but i see the dominant stuff in everything, and frankly, that movie was good although the before-credits end was a bit awkward and strange.the after-credits ending was cool too, except the ""I Live My Life A Quarter Mile / Hour."" line was somehow corny in my opinion",swinger0071,"Oct 22, 2006"
2,Old Fogey Test?,"A boring Friday night with nothing on normal steam-powered telly so I part with three pounds and fifty pence to watch ""The Fast and The Furious"" on digital pay-per-view.After it was all over the only positive thoughts in my mind was that enduring the movie 'on-demand' I had saved myself at least a tenner and had no physical evidence to dispose of in the local landfill. I had spotted this film on a supermarket shelf when it entered the DVD charts (early 2002) and I was tempted to buy. Yup I was nearly suckered by the hype about car stunts and babes. Fortunately I spent my money on routine groceries and as it turns out it was about the same quantity of cash spent on writing the plot.Well fair do's in the end you do get some fast shiny car stunts and cliched Hollywood babes but nothing more noteworthy than the cheap US TV-movie standard car stunts and Hollywood babes you can stumble on channel-hopping Sky. You will not witness anything new or groundbreaking here. It does not get that fast and not particularly furious. At least to my eyes. On the other hand maybe this is the benchmark movie to test if you are an old fogey. Clearly from other reviews this must all look so different to the target early teen market. The only thing missing from this movie is ""The Logical Song"" by Scooter booming out of glossy hot-hatches as they pelt down the road.Now there is a thought. Someone should make a Brit-movie remake with the aforementioned Supertramp track, visits to Halfords for the custom go-faster stripes, gold plated multi-coloured speaker cable and clip-on girth-boosting chrome tail pipes. Fat slags in Novas munching chips instead of Californian babes and Steve Coogan as the lead role. Call it ""The Fat and the Spurious: Grim up North"".The Fast and The Furious. Without doubt the worst movie I have paid money to see in recent years.G Cactus",glowingcactus,"Sep 23, 2002"
No rating,The Fast and the Furious... by far the best movie I have seen all year...,This movie is by far the BEST movie that I have seen in a long time!  The whole movie is action packed and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time!! What a RUSH!  These cars are fierce!  I already have plans to see it this coming weekend for the 3rd time!!  An absolute MUST SEE if you like cars and racing!  Not to mention that the ladies were behind the wheel also!!

8,What a surprise package!,"I was surprised at the comments of the previous user, i loved this movie!  I have to say that im a definite movie buff, but fast cars, action sequences, macho cops, girls in skin tight clothes coupled with brainless actors dont appeal to me.  Thats the impression i had of this flick.  Every guy i spoke to said that they LOVED the movie.  I had NO inclination to watch it either, until my twin made me see it and i was shocked.  Not only was all the stereotypes that i previously mentioned tastefully avoided, but those that were included were executed with style!Excellent!  Vin Diesel was brilliant as Dominic not to mention on the top of my sexiest guys list! Paul Walker could have given a stronger performance, but i think that was mostly due to the script and not a reflection on his acting abilities.  The script is filled with humour and great wit.  What a pleasure to watch a movie, have no real expetations and come out smiling!  I have already seen this movie 3 more times and am not at breaking point yet. I was also thrilled to hear that there is a sequel in the making.
Great Movie - again! See this, there's something for everyone.  Romance, action and not forgetting...the beautiful cars!",sweetrupturedlight,"Apr 25, 2002"
3,Funniest Movie of 2001,"This was the funniest movie of 2001! This is the epitamy of ""dumb humor"". It spoofs such movies as Point Break with its incredibly stupid lines, horribly horrible acting, and 3-minute racing scenes for what should take about 10 seconds. Paul Walker is the worst actor ever to have stumbled his way into the big-screen and that's what really made the movie work. Vin Diesel, a decent actor, chooses the comedy gem that brought him to mainstream humor venues and later got him into the less-funny XXX. I reccommend it for everyone with a sense of humor who can laugh at things like this.That said, this was complete sh*t. Zoolander, I believe, was the funniest movie of 2001 if I remember correctly, and this was the dumbest. Avoid unless you want something to laugh at for its stupidity. If you take it serious, 0/10. If you don't take it serious, 6/10.",Krog__,"Aug 11, 2003"

4,Wonderfully Dated,"2001's The Fast and the Furious was the film that launched a billion-dollar franchise. After seeing the film it was remarkable that it went past one film. It was a more low key film considering how ridiculous The Fast and the Furious franchise became, it was more a crime film with street racing and was pretty much a remake of Point Break. It was a wonderfully dated film because the soundtrack was filled with techno, Ja Rule hip-hop and nu-metal.",freemantle_uk,"May 16, 2021"
No rating,"If you want Racing, it doesn't get any better than this!","I went to see the movie on the first day, with much, much anticipation. I walked in 15 minutes prior to start of the flick, and I could not find 2 seats together since I went with my brother. After 5 minutes of going through the theatre and sitting down, public relations announced that our show is sold out. What I came to realize, is that night that wasn't the only one. EVERY SINGLE SHOW FOR THE 3 DAY WEEKEND WAS SOLD OUT. Doesn't that tell you something? This will be the sleeper hit of this summer.The Fast and the Furious is a mix of adrenaline rushes, compelling racing story, and the overall ""good"" bad guy lead. Vin Diesel rocks as Dominic Toretto, the man of racing in L.A. I've seen everything Diesel has ever done, and every time he exceeded my expectations. Paul Walker is Brian O'Connor, the undercover cop trying to crack a truck-jacking case. I've seen Paul in a couple of flicks, and even though he's no great actor, I don't think I could imagine anyone else who could do it. These two and the rest of the cast are half of what makes this movie. The other half, is the cars, and the driving, which is downright terrific, Gone in 60 doesn't stand a chance. Overall, the movie made me jump in my seat,  speed up my heart beat, and I have to admit, cry. I came out of the show in complete awe, not for the acting, or the story, but for the overall content. I saw it all three weekend days, and must say, it only got better.If you're a fan of driving, cars, and great young actors, this is definitely a movie for you and I highly recommend it. Do not listen to all these big time critics like Ebert & Roeper. These guys aren't us, and can't tell us what we like. So finish reading this, get into your car, pick up your friends, and go see The Fast and the Furious. You won't regret it!!!",simont9,"Jun 24, 2001"
10,I thought it was great,"I have read a lot of reviews on The Fast and the Furious, and most of them were negative.. I saw the fast and the furious twice and I thought it was a really good movie, despite what anyone says. Many people say the actors were crap and didnt act well, but what do you expect? It's not supposed to be going for academy awards here. Its only a low budget film anyway. As for the actors, what is there to say in a movie about cars? ""I love you, I hope we'll always be together?"" I dont think so! The script was very realistic if you ask me.The fast car racing was great, and the cars were even better. If you're not into cars then don't see the movie.. I thought the movie was really good and if you like fast cars, street racers and any of the actors whether they are male or female then i definately recommend you go see this!",Nicole_Nico_87,"Oct 16, 2001"

3,Extremely laughable surge of hormones,"Now, I have a question: Why did people even bother to see this movie? Come on, this is so bad it makes the first Rugrats Movie and Lilo and Stitch look like Lord of the Rings and The Spy Who Loved Me. I know I'm not the type for this kind of movie, but that's not going to let it off the hook. This film is loaded with despicable one-liners and a horrible soundtrack. I don't even know the plot. It's just about a bunch of racers in L.A., and one of them is an undercover cop who's looking for a bunch of hijackers or something like that. It's nothing to take you away. Oh, and starting the movie with two guys arguing about a tuna sandwich? Ooh, that's genius.
Even if that wasn't enough, the cast sucks, plain and simple. Rick Yune delivered a very good performance, but the performances of Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Michelle Rodriguez, and Vin Diesel (Blech) are pretty bad. This film is nothing but a bunch of street homies showing off their sports cars to impress a bunch of stupid girls. In fact, the title of this movie should be something like ""Raging Hormones"". There are its good points though. The effects of day changing to night are cool, the settings of L.A. for the first 20 minutes or so are pretty good, and the race scene is captivating. But most of the other action is pretty lame. There is some stuff to grab you, but nothing to entertain you. I can't believe I stayed up until midnight watching this when I could have been doing something more fun, like dusting mothballs off my clothes or washing dishes. I think I'd rather watch a movie called ""The Telemarketer"" than go through the living heck of watching this monstrosity again. Please spend your time watching a real movie like Star Wars, the James Bond movies, or Lord of the Rings. I think the only believable reason anyone would watch this would be to laugh at how bad it is. My rating for this: 2 out of 5.",marshall89,"Dec 22, 2002"
8,"Indeed a wellmade macho movie ! And, as such, simply perfect.","This movie was exactly what I expected, a macho movie. For that, it was indeed very, very good ! Just like the trailer looked.It had even a little bit of a story, which I didn't expected at all, people had charisma and personality (even the women), the script had good dialogues and some very good jokes, and there where quite a lot of really good stunts and effects.I felt well entertained.

8,The Fast and the Furious,"This was a solid movie. Sure, it was super cheesy, the acting was questionable (It gets way better later in the series), and the plot was kind of funny, but other than that, I really enjoyed this movie, it was the one that started it all, a saga currently 20 years in the making. I have seen all the movies, and it is cool to look and see the original crew, Dom, Letty, Jesse, Leon, and Vince. I mentioned the plot was kind of funny, but the story was great. I loved how Brian was an undercover cop but in the process, he became close with Dom, his sister Mia, and most of his crew. The ending made the movie, it was great, and it was that point that set up the entire Saga.I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to watch it. It is a great movie to watch anytime, and it also opens you up to an entire Saga of movies.**A lot of people don't know this, but there is a Credit Scene at the end of the credits.**",kaden_lewis,"Jul 1, 2021"
9,A commonly underrated movie,"This is one of those movies that i start liking when i watched a 2nd time. Maybe the actors are not the best but they are suitable for the characters. This movie is not about telling a story, is about values and friendship, knowing who we are and what are we willing to lose for those values.The fast and the furious is not an usual action movie, not like ""2 fast 2 furious"", the second part of this one, that is actually the most crappy movie i could ever expect after watching the previous part. Maybe all the bad of ""2 fast 2 furious"" has been attached(unjustly) to the first part.Also a lot of races and speed with tuning cars. I highly recommend this movie for tuning lovers.",riverfrank,"Jul 11, 2006"
4,The Fast and the Furious (2001),"Directed by Rob Cohen. Starring Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, Matt Schulze, Michelle Rodriguez, Chad Lindberg, Thom Barry, Ted Levine, Rick Yune, Johnny Strong, Noel Gugliemi. (PG-13)The FBI and LAPD send Walker undercover to infiltrate a crew of racing enthusiasts that pulls off highway heists, ends up befriending their leader (Diesel) and getting romantically involved with his sister (Brewster). So...""Point Break"" with fast cars replacing surfboards, except this one might actually be even dumber (plus, director Cohen is no Kathryn Bigelow). Drive-in fodder souped up for exploitation cinema's modern era; would eventually spawn a long-running franchise, but in retrospect, feels refreshingly quaint, even grounded. Granted, the script ignores logic and reality at regular intervals, but the stakes are reasonably low and the stuntwork usually seems to exist in the real world. Ardent fans of shiny cars and street racing will probably enjoy it to some degree; for anyone else, it's no better than a way to kill time and appreciate the absence of Tyrese Gibson's witless-cisms. Rapper Ja Rule has a bit part and also contributes a song or two to the ear-splitting soundtrack.45/100",fntstcplnt,"Jan 31, 2020"

4,Dumber than dumb!,"Dumber than dumb! This is the movie that spawned a dynasty of sorts and encouraged numerous little boy and girl racers the world over to turn up the gas. It's a crime caper with a fetish, not just for sleek, fast cars, but for handsome men with buffed up torsos, (the 'attraction' between leads Paul Walker and Vin Diesel makes this possibly the most homoerotic movie of its decade). Ironically, and tragically, Walker himself was to die in a motor accident several films down the line.There isn't a frame of this nonsense you can believe in and the driving sequences, which make up most of the movie, are the stuff of fantasy. Nevertheless, enough boys, (and girls), with a penchant for boy's toys loved this enough to make 'The Fast and the Furious' movies one of the most successful franchises of all time. Give me ""Bullitt"" anyday.",MOscarbradley,"Jan 3, 2020"
No rating,The Lame & The Slow,"This movie was a major dissapointment. This has to be one of the most dis-jointed films I have seen in a while. Too many seens that do not tie in together and you get confused Eg The Asian gang stuffing the owner of a parts store with oil because of some engine that seemed to important.The film also fell in deep spells of slowness. The beggining had a standard car race and until the truck scene there was nothing really else.
Some people call the film 'Point Break on Wheels'. Well Point Break may never go down as a hollywood classic however least it had some story line with scenes which fit logically. It was also more of a adrenalin rush than F & F.F & F was overated and over hyped. Should have went straight to video. Its too bad because there really were some nice cars.",Javert-5,"Mar 30, 2002"

The action sequences are amazing and I just love the whole racing world that they have in the film. I love the character of Dominic, I love how loyal he is to his family and friends. I also love the character Brian, and how he is loyal to Dominic despite everything. Letty is also a great character in the film and I love just how badass she is. She is a take no nonsense badass chick and I think that is just great. This is a great movie overall that is made to be an entertaining action movie. The plot is pretty good overall but what I think is the best part are the action sequences.

2,Sick Of Dinky Cars,"It is all a matter of taste. But, am I the only one who finds these stupid little 4 cylinder cars to be obnoxious? They look like they came out of a cheesy Gamera film. And they sound like a retard trying to sing an opera. A God-awful buzzing noise. I frankly don't care how fast they are, or how much boost they run. If you have 10,000 dollars laying around, you can make almost any vehicle do anything you want. This film just glorifies what I can't stand - white guys, and other non-blacks, trying to act tough and hard with their gay, little, girlie cars.This trendy feckfest, and the two movies that followed, loves make the dumbest comparisons. A 4 cylinder car running nitrous and/or turbo should not be compared to a single cam, pushrod V8 with normal aspiration. Most horsepower figures should not be trusted either. How were the dyno sensors calibrated? How was the engine treated at the time of testing? If you want an example of V8 turbo, look at the Sledgehammer Vette'.Around 900 horses and 254.76 mph.

NOW!","David, Film Freak","Oct 29, 2001"
2,Not a complete waste of time,"""The Fast and the Furious"" is not a good movie, but I must admit, I watched it all the way through.On the plus side, many of the actors and actresses are relatively attractive; Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez are entertaining; some of the action sequences are somewhat entertaining; and the Dodge Charger is cool.On the negative side, the plot is silly at best. Brian lacks any credibility as a law enforcement officer, as do his silly ""superiors,"" and his motivations for anything other than spending time with Mia are a mystery. Dom's motivations are a mystery as well. I suppose the audience is supposed to believe that although he's something of a master criminal and has invested himself in a life of crime, he's OK with lying, and deceit, and police infiltration...Also, the characters lack development. Characterizing them as multi- dimensional would be generous; many cardboard cutouts are more interesting. Lastly, the dialog is entirely lacking in authenticity.I suppose some might think the cars are cool, although I don't know who those folks might be-- perhaps those that dream of nitrous oxide injection systems, and of spending tens of thousands of dollars on cars that sound like angry gnats...If you're looking to fill a couple of hours of your life with a mindless, nonsensical, semi-coherent action movie, this may be the perfect choice. Otherwise, you could most likely find something more worthwhile to do with your time. ""The Fast and the Furious"" is not recommended.",wpkolkho,"Sep 10, 2016"
9,The Gift of Elegant Trash,"Roger Ebert once wrote that there are ""good"" bad movies and there are ""bad"" bad movies.   But once in a while there comes along a truly ""great"" bad movie--a B-picture so desperately trying to claw it's way out of the confines of it's genre that you have to give it credit for nothing if not sheer guts.To call Rob Cohen's ""The Fast and the Furious"" a ""great"" bad movie is a heady compliment indeed.  There have been many attempts at films with similar subject matter that simply fall into the category of ""bad"" good movies (with Renny Harlin's recent car wreck ""Driven"" coming to mind as a picture of great means yet dubious end).  The tale of rival street racers in Los Angeles, ""The Fast and the Furious"" sets itself apart with a strong sense of style and thoroughly exciting racing sequences.In his past works, director Rob Cohen has displayed a journeyman-like quality behind the camera, making very professional, albeit serviceable films that have never been able to free themselves from the manacles of genre (""Dragonheart"" and ""Daylight"" are but two such examples).  But in ""The Fast and the Furious"" Cohen brings a heretofore unseen visual panache to the proceedings, turning a film that could have been a mindless exercise in action histrionics into an exciting, sardonic (yet admittedly still mindless) ride.The film worked for me on a very visceral level, and the expert camera and effects-work were aided by a first-rate sound mix that added a great deal of intensity to the whole affair.  Vin Diesel gives a performance that is all steely-eyed machismo and throaty growls in the place of syllabic speech. But it's a perfect fit for Paul Walker, who strikes all of the right chords in a role meant to register, I suppose, as Keanu-Lite.
Audiences will scratch their heads as motivations shift, loyalties twist, and logic is all but beaten into submission, but ""The Fast and the Furious"" is undeniably entertaining.  It is garbage of the highest order, a ridiculously fun pastiche of genres, stock characters, and well-made set pieces.You may be groaning at the film's idiocy, you may be cringing at it's over-the-top action, but I can almost guarantee that you'll have a smile on your face while doing it.",Ethan-24,"Apr 28, 2001"

I have to say the beginning of one of the most favorite movie series ever. Timing is everything and the chase and race scenes are packed with so much action it will leave you on the edge.

No rating,Slightly Dated But Still Enormously Fun.,"A surprise hit of its year whose unexpected success spawned a franchise that continues to churn out sequels even to this date, The Fast and the Furious is the sole reason why both Vin Diesel & Paul Walker are a household name today and even if it seems a bit dated now, it's still capable of delivering a cinematic ride that's thrilling & fun for the most part.The story of The Fast and the Furious is set in Los Angeles and follows an undercover cop who's assigned to find the gang responsible for stealing expensive electronic equipments, and uses his cover to infiltrate into this world of illegal street racing but soon begins having doubts about where his loyalties lie as he becomes increasingly enamoured by this lifestyle.A finely directed film, the dialogues of which may sound a bit corny now, one of the reasons why this street-racing thriller works is because of the testosterone high it provides with the high-speed racing & chase sequences it packs in, which wasn't an everyday phenomena in movies back in those days, in addition to the plethora of style it oozes from the first frame to the last.On an overall scale, The Fast and the Furious is an exciting blend of an interesting storyline, kinetic direction, energetic camera-work, fabulously edited chase sequences & top-gear score that's fun, enjoyable & entertaining for the most part, while the committed performances by Diesel & Walker do provide the boost it required to propel itself beyond mediocrity. Definitely worth a shot.",CinemaClown,"Sep 2, 2015"
2,Turbocharged Shopping Trolley,"Despite some good action sequences - no, sorry, strike that - a good action sequence involving a bike/car chase toward the end of the movie, there's little to recommend ""The Fast and The Furious"" to anyone with a central nervous system.Vin Diesel tries his best but his performance is lost among a tribe of glove puppets and stick figures. Paul Walker looks great but makes Josh Hartnett The Wooden Boy look like Laurence Olivier. Michelle Rodriguez scowls and pouts so much that she actually looks like a bulldog for most of the movie. Jordana Brewster gives Katy Holmes a run for her money in the WET AS FISH stakes and Rick Yune is woefully miscast as a villain. Yune looks even better than Paul Walker but has all the acting ability of a packing crate. He needs to spend more of that money he made being pretty on acting lessons.Director Rob Cohen clearly hopes that layering on the surface glitz will distract an audience from the dull plot, thinly spread characterisation and unrealistic stunt driving in this movie. Well, he's wrong. If, however, you actually like video-game driving action, Mattel Hot Wheels and lots of barely-dressed girls draped over every available surface, this movie was created for you.You sad, sad individual.",extravaluejotter,"Dec 31, 2006"
9,Fueled With Pure Testosterone,"Muscle Cars and Vin Diesel...now that's what I call a hero sandwich! I don't know why anyone bothered with a plot here.  This is a movie meant to exist on stunts and bravado alone. One thing though, Vin is a much better actor than he was allowed to be here.  He showed more range as the anti-hero in Pitch Black than in this car chase flick.",Lursa,"Aug 3, 2001"
5,"It was good for a while, but it ended up mediocre.","I'm watching the whole series (I only saw 1 and 2), so this is the first one. I liked it for what it was when I was 15 or something, but even then I knew it wasn't good.Besides the awful acting and mediocre at best dialogue, I have to say It was good (just that, good) for a while, which was surprising. All the set-up was fun, even if dumb of course, and the 2nd act was good, creating tension for Paul Walker's character.And then... they dropped the ball. They made a scene that could've cut a lot of boring minutes of this movie, and justify the ending at the same time.And yet, they keep going, wasting all the tension just to have a stupid last motivation for the characters to be where the writers wanted them to be. Again, they didn't need the dumb Hollywood 3rd act because by the end of the second they had the characters in good position to finish the movie. But they wanted more chases, and races, and cars blowing up, and they made a bit of a boring flatter ending.It's ""ok fun"", 5 points.",educallejero,"Mar 24, 2019"

10,Fast and furious all the way,"PLEASE DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE YET TO SEE THE FILM, THE ENDING IS REVEALED IN THIS COMMENT...The Fast and the Furious, the underground sleeper hit of 2001. Not everybody saw it, but most of those who did see it loved it. Starring Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, Paul Walker as Brian O'Connor, and the sexy Jordana Brewster as Dominic's sister Mia, it centres around the escapades of Dominic and his ""team"" of car enthusiasts, who fix up cars when not racing them at breakneck speeds down a ¼ mile stretch of road. Gone are the American muscle cars such as the Viper and the Corvette, replaced by the computer chipped, NOS screaming Japanese super cars, like the Toyota Supra, Honda Civic, and Nissan Skyline. Such beautiful cars blend well with the great cast, as they are as much part of the film as the actors are. The amount of camera time they are given is just enough to show you how powerful and brilliant the cars are, but not too much to suggest they're only there for advertising sakes (like the ridiculous amount of screen time given to the Fed-Ex label in Castaway (2000), which spoils the film). Vin Diesel lives the part of Dominic, a brilliant driver who ""lives his life a quarter of a mile at a time"". His performance is as beefy as you'd expect from the actor who played killer Richard B Riddick in the 2000 hit Pitch Black. He delivers his lines with a style that suggests his character; a nice person when not racing, but deadly serious and all for himself when strapped into his vehicle. Paul Walker is just as good as the undercover cop Brian, hoping to pin a serious of jaw dropping robberies to Dominic. As he learns more about Dom and his team, he falls for Mia, also a great driver, and the lifestyle of fast cars, guns and women. As the film gets near it's amazing climax he struggles to keep his mind on why he's here; to catch Dominic Toretto and put him behind bars. But as they grow closer to each other it gets harder for Brian to do so. Anyone who loved the high speed chases in Ronin, The French Connection, or Bullit, will love the stunts in The Fast and the Furious. From the opening attack on the lorry, with the three sexy Civic's floating on their green neon light as they swerve and cruise around the truck, to the first race and the last race, the action is filmed so cleverly it seems impossible that cars could do what they did. The Civic that slides under the lorry as they speed down the motorway in the pre-credit sequence is simply amazing, and the adrenaline buzz from the first time Dominic and Brian race is great. It all flows so seamlessly between the racing, the stealing, and the normal life of the characters that you don't know what to expect right up until the end. The final scene, however, is outstanding. When Dominic tells Brian midway through the movie about the car he and his father built, a 1969 Dodge Charger with ""900 horses of power"", it's presence is overwhelming, and when he says he's never driven it because ""it scares the shit outta me"", your spine tingles. Dom then pulls it up to the start line he used to race on. He and Brian (driving a Supra) both await the green light, and when it arrives, and Dominic floors the throttle, the car pulls up violently and makes more noise than the cinema could handle, as it screamed off down the road at a shattering speed. But as they get toward the end, the movie stopped for a split second. If Dominic hit the train, and died, then it would become a bad ending to a good film. Neither hit the train, but then Dominic smashes into a truck and flies into the air. Again, if he had died it would be a bad ending, but he did not. The final choice, which fell to Brian as the police sirens got louder, was whether to let Dom go. He does, telling him ""I owe you a 10 second car"", and signifies a great ending to a brilliant film. From start to finish The Fast and the Furious is a NOS powered adrenaline rush, with beautiful actors, scenery, and even more beautiful cars. The start of the final race will live in my memory for a long time still.",tomchiz318,"Jan 4, 2002"
10,AMAZING MOVIE!!!,"I loved this film. I cant understand why anybody wouldnt! But let me guess,the people who didnt like it were white guys from the midwest, RIGHT? As a bi-racial person in my twenties here in Los Angeles, this film was fantastic. It was one of those films where you want to watch it after its finished all over again!!! Besides, everybody in the film is GORGEOUS. Its one of my favorite action films ever, and usually im not a fan of action, but this film was SPECTACULAR!",tequieroselena,"Nov 18, 2001"
No rating,It was Great!,I am not really into cars and all that stuff. I like horses and things with four legs not four wheels.

I watched it on TV and I fell in love with the movie.,mrusso0154,"Sep 7, 2002"
1,So unbelievable,"I watched the first ten minutes and just thought it was so stupid, why go through all the stupid stunts trying to hijack a semi if they had done a little bit of homework the easiest way is to take out the emergency red air line simply locks the brakes on. One hit from a shotgun mission accomplished. Really Dumb",glenjue-20890,"May 19, 2019"
8,I loved it,"This movie is about illegal street racing (people who build or design their own cars to race them) and how someone within the racing world is robbing truckers.  I am a fan of cars, racing, and all that jazz. So this movie was a great way of bringing this underworld to life. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Rick Yune, Michelle Rodriguez (even though her role was small) and Jordana Brewster gave a solid performance. The soundtrack was excellant with every scene. This movie is stellar if you love cars, racing, and music.",Krystall_Mechelle,"Feb 1, 2002"

9,Great Movie!,"I think this movie was great. It showed a lot of adrenaline. Great acting by Vin Diesel. I think that he was discovered and became really famous because of this movie. Michelle Rodriguez is a good actress too, but her skills in acting were not really shown because she only had a few lines in this movie. The cars they used in the movie were okay because in Asia, Honda Civics are a big thing. This movie is recommended for people who like cars and action and for teenagers who are a big fan of Vin Diesel.",pinksimone_08,"Oct 30, 2002"

Okay, so the story-line is thin, and the movie has an open ending(which i love because the now can make a sequal!), but the sound of the cars and the total entourage was perfect!! This is the way i would have liked it over here in Holland, but the car-culture is not as dramatic as is in this movie over here- as is the weather!! I found it most entertaining because i completely lost myself in the movie- the movie didn't bore me throughout the 1 hour 45 min. I went for four times to the movies and now own it on DVD. Thumbs up for more of these kind of movies!!",horrornight,"Feb 26, 2002"
No rating,True reason..,"This movie, to me at least, was awesome. I believe that the only reason that all these people are doggin it is because they are jelous. There is no way in this world that any of them could have done what these actors and actresses have done to make this movie come to life, and as for that Keanu movie that everyone said that this is a remake of, what the hell is Austin Powers than? Because those plot lines did'nt just come out of thin air (James Bond anyone??)...But I will admit that the only bad thing about this movie was having Ja Rule playing a role..not only did he suck, but it was just humiliating to watch..besides that, I loved it and can not wait for the sequel to come out and show us just what happened to Dominic and Brian.",peopleschamp_15,"Jul 19, 2002"
1,This has got to be the worst franchise of all movie franchises,"This has got to be the most awful and stupid movie franchise of any movie franchise imaginable on EARTH. This movie is so stupid, you get better material out of ""Moving"" (with Richard Pryor) than this trash. Well for one, culturally they get the Spanish people wrong. They make it seem that Visigoths (basically a Germanic tribe that conquered Spain, giving us last names like Ortiz and Gonzalez) are not white. Second of all this movie stupidly assumes that Visigoths are the only people in the Spanish word who use the word ""bro"" and ""sis."" Even WORSE, that Visigoth women are the only broish women on earth. When that honor goes to Italians and Spanish (non-Visigoths), Delgados and Riveras. They're the ones who say ""bro"" and chill with guys and wear Jordans, not Sanchezes. Yes I say this because of Letty Ortiz. This movie is the dumbest stupidest movie on the face of the earth. If you want something more realistic watch ""Moving"" with Richard Pryor. This movie is stupid. PURE STUPID!",robert-macc,"Apr 3, 2016"
8,"Ok, OK","My rating:8 out of 10 My explanation:  Alright, the plot did suck, i'll give you that. But look at the rest of the movie its perfect.  If you're not a teenager i doubt you will much like this movie.  Every teen i know loves this movie. The quotes are memorable, and for an athlete/racer, inspirational.  I happen to do track, and before my races, the quotes such as ""winnings winning"" and ""another one bites the dust(yeah i know its a song)"" really help me get pumped.  The soundtrack helps too And to prove i know a little something about movies...this movie is kinda like American Grafitti, its got music all the way through it supporting the plot.  When the music stops, something bad happens. Acting, i thought vin diesel was good, however paul walker sucked.  But thats just me...well i'm done ranting",Lzrdman86,"Jul 29, 2002"
5,Good race scenes lift a fast-paced thriller,"Here's a throwaway popcorn flick that manages to be engaging thanks to the central storyline, that old chestnut of the detective going undercover and becoming friends with the man he's supposed to be sending to jail. The old, old plot is given a new spin with a fresh cast and an interesting backdrop – illegal street racing. Given the MTV expectations, the film is as flashy as you would expect thanks to director Rob Cohen, packed with pumped up loud music to drive to and enough testosterone to fill three football fields. Still, have no misconceptions: this is a high-octane thrill-ride and professes to be nothing more and nothing less.The film certainly satisfies on the action front, with some madly exciting car chases and stunts, although there is a definite lull in the action around midway which is a bit surprising. Thankfully things finish off with an expertly done, extended set-piece involving a truck and an amazing car crash to finish things off (ludicrously spoilt in the trailer). Even cooler, the DVD allows you to rewatch the stunt from EIGHT different camera angles, a feature which has made the format for me.The characterisation is a bit thin on the ground but the two leads are strong: Paul Walker does nothing wrong as the young undercover cop, and Vin Diesel manages to be effortlessly cool and a natural born leader again after PITCH BLACK. The supporting cast is ho-hum, but it is interesting to see DIE ANOTHER DAY's Rick Yune without all that makeup on. Not a perfect movie, but fast-paced and interesting enough to be worth a look.",Leofwine_draca,"Jul 11, 2016"
10,this is the best car movie of the year,"First of all, before this movie i didnt really care and wasnt really into cars. Now that i have watched the movie, i love cars. I thought this movie deserved 2 thumbs up because it was interesting and theres lots of action pack in it. I liked this movie alot because it gives you a look and feeling how it is like to race and to have people race against you. I especially liked how they made a movie only about street racing. I would rate it 10 out of 10 because it has alot of action pack and it doesnt take awhile before the movie gets into the action, in this movie it starts right away. I think whoever loves old or fancy and fast cars will love this movie and i loved all the cars in this movie especially the black car in the end.(the one vin disel was driving)",the_lost_boys3,"Sep 24, 2001"

So if they told you what happened to the guy that got shot, or if (Paul walker) was still a cop, or even if him and the girl got together! Then what would the sequel be about? It's called a CLIFHANGER and it's suppose to be like that, your supose to make up the ending on what you think happened.

2,Shoddy remake of the 1955 classic,"Never watched any of these before so I thought I'd give it the old college try.Oh dear. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. This cinematic abortion looks like it was made in the mid-90s with a mid-80s cast, a mid-70s plot, and a mid- 60s colour palette. Unmitigated cretinosity. Contains many memorable lines, including:'This doesn't feel right.' 'Aaaaaah, my arm!' 'Yeah, it's funny how that works out.' 'I like the tuna here.' 'Let's go for a little ride.''He went to the car wash.'Move over Shakespeare, the pros have arrived!

9,LOVED IT!!!!,"If you like cars, action and heart pounding experiences then you'll love it! The characters are so real and easy to see their point of view.I love the camera work it gives you a feel of the movie. Chills run down your spine as the character presses on the gas and slams on the brakes and when they change gears. This movie is WONDERFUL!",lil_ATX_chic,"Mar 11, 2002"
3,Underwhelming from Beginning to End,"Set in Los Angeles, The Fast and the Furious follows Paul Walker's character, an up-and-coming street racer whose cocky antics land him in a race he loses. After saving Dom (Vin Diesel), who is in charge of a small group of racers and owns a garage, the two become good friends. Paul Walker is actually an undercover cop trying to get evidence against these racers as many of them attack trucks on highways and steal their cargo.What sounds like an exciting plot is ruined by lackluster pacing and, at least for me, a lack of excitement. Cars, guns, tits, a pointless shot of two girls kissing, beer. It's all the kind of things that fourteen year old boys tend to masturbate too. And that's not to say the film is childish (which, let's face it, it kind of is) but it is built to appeal to a crowd that I don't belong to. The actual racing of the film is drag racing, which does not translate to exciting pieces of action. Driving in a straight line toward a finish line and pressing a button for nitro is not fun to watch and I felt the opening drag race between Walker and Diesel had some pretty poor directing. It looked obviously sped up and I can understand it was done that way to actually allow us to see the cars, but it looks pretty stupid.As far as characters go Brian O' Conner (Walker) is as boring as they get. The romance between himself and Dom's sister could be interesting for character interactions if the characters themselves were worth anything. Dom himself is cool if only because he's supposed to be. You can easily dismiss every character here as none are truly worth remembering.And then there is the pacing I mentioned before. It starts off moving at a decent clip but slows dramatically in the middle. The final twenty minutes are a mishmash of endings with a climactic scene on the highway followed by a climactic chase through the streets of LA and finalized with a climactic (and pretty pointless) scene of drag racing. There are some loose ends that needed to be tied by the end, but it's done pretty poorly and doesn't feel organic. It just feels like the writer wanted to jump from here to here to here with nothing to lead to that next scene.The Fast and the Furious is pretty dumb and juvenile, with really nothing to offer aside from a few sweet cars. It's a lackluster film that you'd be best off watching on TV.",sn319,"Dec 6, 2014"

10,The first and the best,"The first movie of the successful saga is probably the best one. We are introduced to the main characters and to a world most of us had only heard of.

You won't leave the theater or your living room without feeling some kind of emotion.I was fortunate enough to watch this in one of the best movie theaters in the country so I could enjoy the sound effects in all of their glory! However, as a petrolhead, I have to forget how many times they change gears (9 times? Really?!) to properly enjoy the movie about special cars and a large family (in the truest sense of how a family should be).The cars are also loud actors who are given to the right characters. The actors really studied and embraced their role to a point where we can feel their emotions and identify ourselves with some of them. There is a real chemistry between them and that is a very positive thing in this type of movies.10 out of ten to the best movie of one of the most successful sagas ever launched by Hollywood.

And if you are a guy who likes fast cars, look no further. Sure the dialogue is cliched and the plot is amateurish, but who cares! A film like this allows you to forget its flaws as you are so wrapped up in the cars, the women, and the chases. Vin Diesel is great as always, Paul Walker was kind of stiff but then again most cops are. Now I loved Michelle Rodriguez in GIRLFIGHT, but here she was mainly used as eye candy. The chase sequences are some of the best I've ever seen, easily putting films like GONE IN 60 SECONDS and even THE FRENCH CONNECTION to shame. It offers little for women, old people, and those who follow all the traffic laws. But be warned: this film may cause you to drive a little faster and more reckless.

10,Best film ever. Some comment are SO WRONG!,"I loved the film I have only watched it 3 times but the first time I saw it was yesterday so I suppose it is quite a lot. All of you people who say that you didn't like it because it had no plot obviously don't know what you are talking about. And people who say that it wasn't supposed to be an interesting movie and that the best line was ""I'll have the tuna"" also don't have a clue.Of course this film had good cars pretty girl and gorgeous men but then what film doesn't! Saying that it hadn't been thought out. Have you even listened to the film. One line which I love and has obviously been thought out is said by Domonic(Vin Diesel)who is a brilliant actor for any1 who says hes not ,and that was :""I live my life a quarter mile at a time ,nothing else matters.....for those 10 seconds or less I'm free"" That is actually how some people feel about racing and whatever they do.This film is NOT about fast girls and fast cars it is about what life is like for people who do this in real life. It is about how people feel about their team and about friendship because come on the cop gives up on his job for his friends and his love. If you go in expecting it to be fast girls and fast cars then you will see it as that but if you go in with an open mind you will see that it is the best movie ever made. The cars girl and men are all just bonuses to the brilliant storyline! GO SEE IT AND YOU WILL LOVE IT LIKE I DO!",Lisa-Michelle,"Mar 30, 2002"
3,Great preview = bad movie,"When I saw the preview I thought it should be a great car movie.  Problem is the preview looks great, but the movie is awful.  There is a couple of good scenes in the movie, one involving a truck, and the other which I saw on the preview.  Give me a L and a, and a m and a e and you got lame. This film is so lame if it were a dog they would shoot it. The casting is terrible, all the thieves look like they came out of a boy band.  No one could hijack a truck the way they do it  with out every member being squashed.  Hey, a small Honda is not my fantasy racing machine.  Maybe people shoot lower for what they expect in a car.  The lead girl in the film looks homely. Watching a car on nitro go in a straight line does not excite me into believing that is great driving.  I see that everyday next to the highway I live by.  Except for two stunts in the film there is no furious car chasing in this film.  The script is a bunch of situational scenes put together with no overall story to tie the film together.  This film is so bad its not worth renting.",mm-39,"Jun 26, 2001"
No rating,A great movie,"Well i think a girl is the last person i'd let review this movie unless she's living in the fast lane.First of all i think for a movie at this budget it is very well done. Second the acting may have not been great but i don't think it was terrible.Third I just enjoyed it  instead of being typical and saying like oh this movie sucks or what not.I didn't produce it or have to go through the shooting and i'd respect this movie cause i think it was very good at  portraying the racing scene.See i myself race a Honda CRX,so i know you'll think oh yeah he's liking it just for the cars well yes and no.I thought this movie had better cars then the movie ""Bullet"" though i think that movie was better i am not gonna be one of this sterio typical movie geeks and say oh it's not as good as the old on,well the fast and furious that was made in 1954 isn't good ladys and gentlemen.And bullet did have a better plot but this movie was raw to show what we kids do on the street.And for the  lines that the actors use? well this is like real people and not fancy talk so if you can't stand that enough to not see this movie then well you've got to just watch it.I'd say on a scale one to ten this was a eight and that is  playin it straight and not being typical a to a guy flick like girls are.",bryan2rocco,"Aug 10, 2002"

This is a believable film that tells the story about family trying to make ends meet and maintaining the trust they hold so close to their heart. Paul Walker gives a great performance that fits his character perfectly. I love how you watch Paul Walker fall in love with Mia and struggle with his identity. He knows that his place is with Dom, but find himself displaced and trying to hold on to his old life as a cop. As far as fast and furious movies go this is by far one of the best ones.

10,pretty damn good,"I thought it was awesome-it was everything i expected it to be. People who say it was bad must have been expecting some beautiful film with great actors and an in depth plot. u obviously expected wrong. in all the ads it always showed exactly what it was, a movie with guys cars and violence. not bad violence, really. it was entertaining. of course the characters werent developed and the plot was a little crazy. thats how it was meant to be.",mswoosh13,"Jun 25, 2001"
4,I`m Too Old For This,"I guess being born 36 years ago I`m too old to enjoy THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS by about .... oh twenty years ? It would be flippant to criticise something that was produced solely for MTV addicts so I won`t mention that Rob Cohen`s direction is just a feature length music video where the chicks are too fit to be true or that when someone walks around they do so in sexy slo mo , or that the soundtrack is intrusive , or that the cars are too fast to be realistic or that the multi ethnic problems of street culture are ignored . In fact that is a valid criticism as the bloods , crips , underclass and middle class students all get together and no one seems to have a culture issue . Vin Diesel is another valid criticism . Am I alone in thinking that he`s the only leading man in film history who rivals Steven Segal as most unconvincing actor ever ? Oh and I have never ever seen so much product placement in my life . Aren`t there any laws against this sort of thing ? By a very strange irony I have a FAST AND FURIOUS T-shirt . Ironic in the sense that I wore an item of clothing for a film whose existance only seems to involve advertising products",Theo Robertson,"Mar 20, 2003"
No rating,In order to like the movie you have to understand STREET RACING!,"I myself loved the movie. The intense car races and good looking guys. I loved the plot and there was a plot for all of you who said there wasn't. Maybe you should watch it again, and if your too ignorant to watch it again so people like me can prove you wrong then I guess you already no your wrong. Now if your one of those people who have nothing to do with street racing then by it's trailers you should have known it wasn't a movie for you. Which it other words means you wasted $8 or $9 bucks and your the only one to blame for it. The whole movie was summing up exactly what happens when you street race and when your apart of that crowd. So I suggest if you didn't like this movie don't even attempt to show up to watch street racing because if you do your most likely going to be watching "" The fast and the Furious"" again.",strawberryboricua,"Jun 29, 2002"
10,KICKS A$$,This movie kicked some serious ass to the max :)  People keep saying it had a bad plot and all...it didn't...everyone that said that is probably over the age of 25 or married  or something.

8,High-Octane Entertainment,"The summer of 2001 was filled with a countless number of action flicks that for the most part were successful.  ""The Fast and the Furious"" was one of them.  Some of the previews for this movie which have Limp Bizkit's ""My Way"" or Ja Rule's ""Furious"" playing in the background can lead you to expect a no-holds-barred film with relentless action scenes that are made to get the adrenaline pumping.  ""The Fast and the Furious"" for the most part has all of that.  The acting here is pretty good despite the fact this is a summer action film.  Vin Diesel is already on his way to super-stardom as is Paul Walker.  The racing scenes are excellently done but look a lot more like something out of a really hot Playstation 2 game, as someone pointed out earlier at this site.Now for the bad parts.  The storyline sucks mainly because we saw it in another movie that was released nearly ten years before ""The Fast and the Furious"".  That movie was ""Point Break"" which just so happened to star Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves.  The plotlines for both films are almost identical.  I'm going to do this in comparison style with ""The Fast and the Furious"" first and ""Point Break"" second.  ""The Fast and the Furious/Point Break"" both have rookie cops(Paul Walker/Keanu Reeves) going undercover(LA street racing scene/LA surfing scene) to find the culprits behind several daring heists(truck heists/bank robberies).  The cops both fall in love with someone close to the suspected ring leader(Jordana Brewster/Lori Petty). The endings for both films pretty much leave the door open for sequels but is more likely with ""The Fast and the Furious"" than it is ""Point Break"". None of these complaints however, really had an effect on my viewing pleasure.  Lastly, what the hell happened to Ja Rule?  His performance seems to be more a lot more of a cameo than a small role.  He's only in one scene in the whole movie(the first racing scene) and I expected him to at least be in more scenes.    Well ""The Fast and the Furious"" gets an 8/10 despite the absence of Ja Rule.",dee.reid,"Jan 24, 2002"
5,"Just rent ""Point Break"" instead","""Fast and the Furious"" is largely a re-hash of ""Point Break."" The idea behind both films is similar: undercover cop infiltrates youth subculture to bust a faction of it that's committing real crimes. In ""PB"" the guy blending into the scenery is Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves), who you'd easily mistake for a surfer. Johnny U. is actually interesting, actually seems to have a past, a life, a personality. But while ""Fast"" protagonist Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is heroic and likeable, we're never told anything about the guy. He wants to make detective, and so is doing his undercover tour of duty busting some auto mechanics turned bad. That's about all we're told, though. His character is defined by the circumstances he's in, not by the person he actually is.  Character and plot isn't exactly director Rob Cohen's number one priority here of course. For sheer high-speed thrills, ""Fast"" delivers the goods. Cohen saves the best for last. Three big high-speed chase scenes close it out. The finest of them, also the best action scene I've seen this year, is another hijacking involving a tractor/trailer. This time the trucker is ready for them, though. An exhilarating mixture of cross-cutting, directing and stunts, this was expert filmmaking. Then the film's creators find a way to keep it going, plotting a race car versus motorbike sequence, followed by a good old-fashioned old-versus-new drag race with railroad tracks serving as the finish line. Of course, there's a train coming at high speed. That's good stuff. By the time it's all over, you really feel like you got your money's worth. For me though, without a strong plot to push it along, it's all a waste.  Women in the audience might be disappointed that only one girl (Michelle Rodriguez of ""Girlfight"") gets to race (well, she wins anyway). The primary use this film has for women is showing them scantily-clad, putting themselves up as trophies for the winners of these races. Using women as props is nothing new to the action genre. Still, going into ""Fast"" I had hoped for better. Haven't we come to a point in movie history where it's safe to expect something for everyone? Whether you're a chick or a dude, you're unlikely to identify with any character in this.
Even a movie as dumbed-down as this tries to grow a brain now and again. One such moment in `Fast' involves Chad Lindbergh's character, Jesse. He's a genius about anything automotive. He builds the engines legendary street racer Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel, who's real name would've worked better) puts in his cars. He says the only reason he didn't go to, say, MIT, is that he suffers from A.D.D. With Jesse, the film raises the question of how a great mind may or may not be going to waste simply because he couldn't pay attention in class. He represents an entire demographic of kids with great potential on  the fast-track to nowhere. Who to blame? A society too dependent on social classes, diplomas and college degrees? Does a lack of direction justify choosing the criminal path? The film opens the issue, but has little to actually say about it.  ""The Fast and the Furious"" commits one too many transgressions against my sensibilities to recommend it, even on the strength of the action sequences. But do see ""Point Break"": more action, more style, much more of a plot, and better characters. It really is the whole package and besides, surfing is still cooler than street racing.

5,Rather weak crime movie with superficial street racing elements,"In an ironic sense, this movie is like much of the car tuning business these days. That is, cheap and fake, like the plastic hood pin replicas you attach on the hood with foam tape. This movie has plenty of things to make a car enthusiast cringe; the way which this movie bunches car tuning, street racing and organized crime tightly together isn't exactly the most pleasing approach. The stuff about double-clutching, failing to use proper terms and very loose involvement on events in a race gives an impression the writer gained all his knowledge about race driving out of a five-point bulletin list on how to drive a Nascar racer. Finally, the movie practically drops out of street racing premise after 1/4th way through.The street racing theme is only a facade to a substandard crime movie. It's soon obvious the movie is more about blasting away with guns than racing on the streets. Making a distinct good guy - bad guy -scenario and thus having the police to sanction the main character's actions, the movie did not have to deal with the legal and moral issues of street racing or the dangers involved. Pure street racing as such would probably have been too difficult a subject to the writer and too controversial for the producers, so they put guns, explosions, hi-jackers and an oriental gangster mob into the movie, none of which really belongs (well, except perhaps the gangster bunch, but they were made OTT, big time). The race scenes aren't that well made either; they're about driving a straight line and when to hit the nitrous (or Nnnaaawwwzzz as it's called in the movie) for victory. It's not about who's the best driver, it's about who has the most $$$'s under the hood. There's not enough car stuff to keep enthusiasts interested, the plot pretty much sucks rocks through a garden hose and the bulk of the movie is generic crime movie material. The latter half of the movie is almost completely disconnected from the first, the two elements (racing and crime) support each other in a truly superficial way, and the dialog is awkward.",Karri_Koivusalo,"Apr 27, 2006"
No rating,Bad script; worse acting; top movie.,"BAD SCRIPT, WORSE ACTING, TOP MOVIE.If you've seen the film, you'll know that there's little more I have to add. If you haven't, you probably won't be surprised. A movie involving lots of fast (and expensive) cars was never going to be very deep, with probably little money left over for decent actors or scriptwriters after paying for the cars and stuntmen.The film sets out to be a commercial, high octane (excuse the pun), loud and colourful one, and it is, and is no more. It's not SUPPOSED to have any sort of intellectual appeal; appeal is based on excitement. Whether or not this is any bad thing is up to the viewer, but personally, I enjoyed switching my brain off for an hour and a half and enjoying some good-old-fashioned stupid excitement. 7/10",bimmo,"Aug 9, 2002"
10,"Awesome, awesome movie!!!",The Fast and the Furious is my favorite movie! I love both Paul Walker and Vin Diesel. I think the movie has a great story line and great acting. It is a very fast paced action movie with a very interesting storyline and as the plot unfolds you get deeper and more into the movie. The cars in it are really cool and I think the movie can to appeal to all action movie lovers! It is also a movie that can be enjoyed by people of many different ages. I have seen it many many times and will continue to watch it often and share it with all of my friends. This is a movie that I would highly recommend because I really enjoy it!,krazee54,"Sep 1, 2005"
8,"Great car film, lacks in thorough plot but theres been much worse!","the film is one of the best car films ever, but yes as everyone seems to to say it does lack a decent plot. being a high concept film it doesn't need, or meant to have a really thought out plot. The visual side is very entertaining and the car stunts are awesome and unique. One to see if you love cars. One not to see if you think an undercover detective visiting the street racing scene is pathetic... ?",fat_boz,"May 7, 2002"
5,Mostly made for Car people,"It was okay but I think it's more made for people who are into action and cars. I watched it and vin diesel was the only character I found interesting in the slightest, he played a really cool and somewhat interesting character and he was relatively funny. The story is pretty good and added slight Intensity and allowed the story to have more value than just an action flick but it still wasn't an overly special or deep story. The action was relatively cool but I personally couldn't really keep interest in it, honestly if you love the driving parts of the movie cars and you like gang type characters then I guess you'll love this. The final half an hour was really good though.",popyoshi-36312,"Feb 26, 2023"

5,"The good, the bad and an ugly movie","Rob Cohen's ""The Fast And The Furious"" has been a box office hit, but is just a disappointment. It's much sight and sound, but like switching through the TV channels with a remote control with no contents at all. There's no hint of a story, just something about some bad young guys driving around in very fast cars, doing illegal and cool things like car races, tuning their turbo killing machines and doing very male stuff like beating the s*** out of themselves. There are some pretty girls as well in sweaty black t-shirts and a good guy who's in fact an undercover police officer who's searching for something and falls in love with the girls of the gang.Director Cohen's doesn't care at all about a script, a good story and good actors, he's just interested in the straight, fast and loud action of popcorn cinema, and you're getting a lot of that. There are dozens of well-shot car chases, showdowns, gun and fist fights, etc., but it all remains a heartless spectacle with too many stupid dialogues that should be only used in a Spinal Tap movie. The villain is bald and bad and played by Vin Diesel, the hero is blond and bright and played by Paul Walker, the other gang members have beards and are shouting like hell, and the girls are just there for completing the crew. Even the conflict of a policeman investigating undercover and becoming fascinated by a counter culture isn't developed well and explored at all like in William Friedkin's ""Cruising"" or Katheryn Bigelow's ""Point Break"" - it's just one more vague cliché presented on an assembly line, fastly running of course.If you like some mindless highway action you might find some good and entertaining scenes in this movie, but there are lots of better movies built around car chases and vehicle action - check out cult movies like the groovy ""Vanishing Point"", Steven Spielberg's ""Duel"", Walter Hill's ""Driver"", Norman Jewison's great ""Rollerball"" or the odd ""The Cars That Ate Paris"" by Peter Weir. ""The Fast And The Furious"" mainly quotes scenes from these movies and from other car chasing classics like ""French Connection"", ""Bullitt"", the ""Mad Max"", ""Terminator"" and ""Lethal Weapon"" series, and even James Dean's legendary car race in ""Rebels Without A Cause"" is ripped off here. But all in all you're just asking what it is all about and will find the answer in Shakespeare again - much ado about nothing.",Mikew3001,"Jun 28, 2004"
No rating,My opinion of The Fast and the Furious.,"At first I thought this would be a rip-off of Gone in 60 Seconds but I was so wrong. This film is the bomb! The cast are excellent and makes the film even better. It has a good storyline that works well. The chemistry between Vin Diesel (Dom) and Michelle Rodriguez (Letty), Paul Walkers (Brian) and Jordana Brewsters (Mia) was believable. This is a great film and I look forward to the sequel.",CharmedDarkAngelBuffyFREAK,"Sep 1, 2002"
10,Get Ready to Race!!!!!,"Since this movie came out, I had no intentions to see this. This movie looked like a dud in my eyes. But, since the fourth one came out with mainly positive reviews, I decided to take my chances. This is one of the better racing movies you will ever see. I enjoyed watching this film.This film is about street-racing. Basically, a undercover FBI agent hooks up with a street racing gang to find criminals and love. The thing is, he enjoys street racing more than being an agent.Tons of people are saying that the acting is terrible, but I disagree. Vin Diesel played what he does best, a macho guy, and Paul Walker did a really good job. I will also say that the two girls, Brewster and Rodriguez are hot.If you like hip-hop, you will like the music. You will feel your energy rate soar through the roof along with the transmission.

It made me wish I was in the movie, playing out the same real life scenarios with the actors. It was invigorating. Plus, it's a great movie that girls and guys can watch together.

5,Hackneyed,"Although decent, this movie was better the first time I saw it back when it starred Keanu Reeves, Patrick Swayze and was named ""Point Break"".  To quote my friend, ""Undercover cops?  Asian Gangs?  What is this, the 80s?""Basically, this movie appeals to the MTV crowd which needs to be stimulated every few seconds by bright lights and loud noises in an effort to maintain their short attention spans.  There were several glaring errors in this movie that led me to believe that it was written by a film student who tried to take his spice up his loser adolescent years by trying to portray the teenagers who put thousands of dollars worth of rims, subwoofers and the like into their $500 car.  I'm sorry Mr. Writer sir, but this hackneyed movie does not justify your youth, back when you worked for minimum wage and later spent it on a new muffler.First, truck drivers are union and the merchandise is insured.  Therefore, drastic measures are not needed to rob trucks.  Have you ever seen ""Goodfellas,"" when Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci robbed the truck?  Although my memory is fuzzy, I can be sure that they did not use harpoons.Second, a Ferrari will never race any tuned car.  I know people who have Lotuses, Porsches, and Corvettes, and they refuse to race them.  Why? Because by virtue of owning an expensive sports car, you already showed the person up.The list goes on (including the fact that the actors are in their mid-twenties, and the people who actually do this kinda stuff for fun usually mature out of it by the time they hit 19.)But there is one positive:  The movie had a good ending, even though it was a rip-off of Point Break.  In fact, if A.I. had an ending half as good as Fast and the Furious, I wouldn't have wanted to vomit on my new shoes.",stalemilk1,"Jul 17, 2001"
10,Fast and The Furious is just plain awesome,"Fast and the Furious is a great movie for those who like fast movies that you can't pause in the middle of a scene to go get a snack. It has awesome and fast cars, the cars themselves could keep you watching this movie. Of course you have to consider that I am a young girl who thinks Paul Walker is the hottest guy on the planet and loves action movies. I think some sorry to say, but boring adults who only like those incredibly boring movies that has to explain every detail 10 times.",kookookalee,"Aug 1, 2003"
2,Overrated and over-hyped,"I believed all the hype when The Fast and the Furious first came out as everybody was talking about how awesome the movie was. Upon hiring this out on video I felt totally cheated. The Fast and the Furious is one of the most overrated and over-hyped movies I have ever seen. As far as I'm concerned this is just brainless, action packed, testosterone fueled eye candy designed to attract teenagers who need lessons in how to act cool. Following the total disappointment of The Fast and the Furious, I vowed never to watch any of the sequels.If you have seen Point Break (a far more enjoyable movie), you get the idea of what the whole movie is about. Basically it is about a police officer played by Paul Walker (for a police officer in his late 20's, he behaves like a teenager who is too cool for school) who goes undercover to infiltrate the illegal street racing scene in order to investigate a series of hijackings led by Vin Diesel, who is the leader of the street gang responsible for the hijackings as well as the undisputed king of the street racing scene.The rest of the characters are nothing more than one dimensional testosterone filled, swaggering gangster show offs and super sexy bad girls.The Fast and the Furious is peppered with many lame one liners. ""I live my life a quarter mile at a time"", takes the cake as one of the worst one liners.Although The Fast and The Furious is still a popular movie with a large fan base, there is very little to like about this overrated, brainless and over-hyped rubbish. I'm very surprised the franchise has continued on, however I still think that surely it would have run out of petrol by now. Perhaps one day, the franchise will drive off into the sunset for good.2/10",Cinemaniac1984,"Jan 4, 2015"
No rating,Entertaining action,"This was a good, solid piece of entertaining action. By now, you know the advice: Don't go in expecting The Godfather. You have to go in with a ""This is an action movie."" mindset.My only complaint about the movie is that I felt some things were left unresolved, and while, yes, it's only an action film, I do feel that no movie should leave things unresolved. By the end of the film, I didn't really know where the lead character stood with his bosses in the police force or with his would be girlfriend. Having said that, the action scenes are tightly done. Good action, good soundtrack, good pacing. And I highly recommend it if you're in the mood for an action film.",konover,"Jan 27, 2002"

5,Exciting for the racing scenes. The rest of the movie...Not so much.,"The Fast and the Furious tells the story of an undercover cop who infiltrates a gang of street racers looking for the person who's been organizing highway robberies against transport trucks. However, the deeper he gets, the more like them he becomes. I personally think that this movie had potential to be really good, but instead it was just okay.I'll start off with what made the movie worth watching. Cars, cars, and more cars. Anyone that likes fast cars and cars racing and cars crashing will definitely get their share from this film. All of the racing scenes are expertly filmed with the camera examining the engine and the exhaust pipe as the car speeds up. There's also the fact that the film involves cops and robbers, so there's violence and gunfights as well. Unfortunately, that's about it...The plot isn't terrible, but it could have been better developed. It isn't complicated enough. The plot is really simple. I don't want to say that not enough happened, because it did have enough, but there was just something about it that didn't seem complete. And the acting? Well, as you can expect, the acting wasn't that great. Paul Walker looked bored half the time, like he didn't want to be there. Vin Diesel? Well he's just a bad actor anyway. Overall, The Fast and the Furious is a fun action film, but if you take it seriously...It sucks.5/10",theshadow908,"May 7, 2006"

2,Superficial to the Core; Puffed Chests and Showy Rides Abound,"The testosterone reaches critical mass quite early in this ridiculously self-indulgent nitrous oxide orgasm. Paul Walker gets his breakout role as an undercover cop, one with very little interest in actually doing any police work, who falls in with a crew of enterprising gear heads on the midnight street racing circuit. Vin Diesel, the headline costar, takes on his usual character: a growling, flexing, ultra-chill bro with shady connections but an open heart. Neither are particularly likable or interesting.The whole thing is shallower than a toilet bowl, ticking so many ""cool point"" boxes that it mimics a rich, forgettable, three-minute music video. We've got fast cars, gorgeous sex objects, adrenaline-rich action scenes, loud radio hits (juuust a bit dated) and a posh location or two. Not much in the way of meaningful character arcs or deeper substance.It's a true ""what you see is what you get"" experience. Big and dumb and gruff and insecure, with a plot that varies from meaningless to pointless and a versatile cast with nothing to do beyond gripping the steering wheel (or each other) and looking sexy. On this first go-around, at least, the action retains some passing association with reality. Points for that.",drqshadow-reviews,"Aug 12, 2019"
No rating,Loud Lavish and Likeable.,"In the Keanu Reeves, Patrick Swayze movie 'Point Break', A young cop goes undercover as the member of a team in order to root out some crims and things escalate when they move on the wrong gang and start to realise that the offenders are closer to home than realised. It comes down to a choice between loyalty to his cause or to his friendship. In this flashy, loud and heavy petrol head flick it is no different, infact there are more similarities between them than just in the basics. It is a step by step re-hash. If there was to be between them a re-watch choice it would be this one over and over again though. It is gripping, with solid performances and a unique and impressive look. This movie is easily the best car flick yet.A veteran of Pitch Black, Vin Deisel I would say is headed for action stardom. He's a similar character in both but it doesn't matter. Pitch black is an under-rated gem and this by legitimate critics reviews is a worthily rated gem. I think they deserve Sound Design and Cinematography oscar nominations for it, the Limp Bizkit overtures are the only thing really that could do them out of it, they have the worst rep on the globe which is why they are so successfull, the oldies who vote for the academy would hate that.

There's something about Vin Diesel in this movie that gives this movie the finish touch. Without him, this movie will be lost. When a guy named Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) is an undercover cop and goes into the street racing world to find out who is hijacking these trucks with expensive cargo on them. Then he joins a cool L.A. suberb group that is the middle of the racing world.

10,Sweet Movie-You must see it!!,"I thought that The Fast and the Furious was a great movie. Although I did enjoy the cars in the movie, I also enjoyed Paul Walker, who played Officer Brian O'Connor/Brian Spillner. This movie really got me hooked on him. I have also seen Joy Ride with him and liked that too, not just because Paul Walker is in it! I have always been into cars, so when this came out, I was psyched.

5,if only they didn't speak....,"'The Fast and the Furious' is good when it is both fast and furious.  The problem with the film lies in between.  Well, actually the problem with the film is any time an actor opens their mouth and spouts out some sort of inane dialogue.  Paul Walker delivers his lines with the same deadpan, almost non acting approach that has made Keanu Reeves famous.  His voice sounds the same too.  If I had closed my eyes I would have sworn it was Keanu. I was just waiting for him to spout out the words ""Whoa"" or ""Dude"". No such luck however.  Vin Diesel was disappointing as well.  At least acting wise that is.  He does fill in his role well, as he has the right look.  The acting and directing, still, are both horrible.  The parts of the movie with dialogue are horrible.  The parts of the movie with the cars, however, are not.This movie has the absolute best, most high octane and exciting car racing(and chasing)scenes I have ever seen in my life.  The movie excels on this level.  It is a great adrenaline rush just watching it.  I wish the movie was silent with a lot of the car scenes because then we would have had a great action movie.  Unfortunately they bogged it all down by trying to incorporate a plot(a bad one I might add), your standard romances, and you standard double crosses.  It excels on one level, but on the level that makes a movie great, it completely flounders.  It is worth watching to see the car races, especially if you like that sort of thing.  But if you are like me, and you require good acting, good dialogue and a good story, well then you probably won't be that impressed.  5 out of 10.",tripper0,"Sep 26, 2001"
10,This movie was the best!,"My sister had to pay me 5 bucks to watch this movie with her. Afterwards, I had to pay her 15 to buy me this movie! Vin Diesel is totally hot! And Paul Walker was perfect for the undercover part! Michelle Rodregaiz was a perfect Letti, and Jorgana was perfect for Mia. Chad Limburg was excellent as jesse and leon and vince had perfect actors as well. Anything that combines cool cars with hot actors deserves two thumbs up!!",Rhiannon20,"Sep 7, 2002"

I understand how big street racing is, but young Asian men with rich parents acting like gangsters intimidating folks for engines, toting automatic weapons?  Hi-Jacking trucks for stereos? FBI sending in a punk undercover cop to infiltrate a $6 million dollar operation?  Why would they bother?I guess I like Point Break better, and Keanu Reeves is a better actor then Paul Walker (Wait! did I just say that?)  It seemed like Walker was trying to act like Reeves in P.B.

10,"DAMN, I would pick this movie as the GOAT","Imagine as an officer of the law, and you are send undercover to bring an end to the this racing...I bet you an awful load of cash, you will resign and sign up for the racing, it's not Paul Walker's fault, it's just that the racing was freaking addictive. Going undercover is never easy, especially with such affable miscreants.The basic premise is really nothing special. But then again, it doesn't need to be. The point of this movie is in its style. It has fast cars, lots of racing, lots of hot, greased-up babes, muscle-heavy men (and cars) and a killer soundtrack. You don't watch it to be intrigued by carefully orchestrated plot points or tragic backstories or the heaviness of its pathos. No, you watch it to kick back, relax and have a good time.And in delivering that, the movie more than delivers. But if it was just that, I'd probably rate the film a bit lower. What actually elevates this film above its immediate peers and helped launch a huge franchise, is the fact that this film is punching above its weight class and succeeding.It's one of those movies you dream about, talk about and even try to drive like Vin Diesel.

4,a teen boy's movie,"This is a movie which is obviously aimed at the teenage male. Its dialog is far from deathless and it has patches which are memorable -- only for triteness. Nevertheless, I found myself swept up in the races and concerned with whether Vin Diesel would discover Paul Walker's reason for wanting to hang with him. Is Toretto (Diesel)behind the high jacking of the contents of trucks on the highway? The opening scene showed such a robbery but by the time you see all the cars driven by Toretto and his friends you can no longer remember what the cars looked like in that exciting scene. All in all I enjoyed the film and its resolutions (Then again, I watch Patrick Swayze in ""Roadhouse"" every time I can.) But it's no mystery why street races increased in the L.A. area after its release.",rkdoidge,"Jun 6, 2005"

Fast Furious team amazing a good life lesson.The brotherly bond between Vin and his brother and their sister is so amazing.Sharing of their feelings especially when they are angry with each other. Then suddenly you see them in close bond again. Lessons are when a team is a team it continues to embrace each other without pain.

5,Great adolescent speed flick.,"The Fast and the Furious was full of action and adventure - it's just that it was all very implausible with all these young men driving very expensive cars and betting their pink slips on one race. Yet, the main character Paul Walker is driving these expensive machines while deriving his income as an auto parts delivery boy! If I were to rate this movie on action/adventure alone it would warrant a 7-8, but then if you only watched movies for that aspect you should just rent any generic van Damme movie. Somewhat original depiction of the Japanese cars mod craze where cars are chopped and modified by teens to inject some sportiness into bland Honda Civics. Because of the originality of the cars my 14 year old son was glued to the TV waiting for the next ""sweet"" machine to emerge. If you like cars and fast driving scenes this is a movie I'd recommend, but the theme is highly implausible and the hijack scenes are borderline Jackie Chan.",lacorte,"Mar 4, 2002"

4,Terrible,"""The Fast and the Furious"" is basically your standard summer blockbuster - stupid, loud, and lots of explosions.  Amazingly, this movie sinks to depths that most summer blockbusters have never reached.The story surrounds an undercover FBI agent (Paul Walker) who is trying to find out who has been stealing electronics equipment.  This leads him to a group of underground street drag racers.  Despite the numerous plot holes, such as the idiotic way in which the criminals go about stealing the equipment, and Walker's inexplicable behavior, this movie actually could've been good.  The premise is interesting, and the drag racing scenes are fairly exciting.Where this movie falters is the characters.  None of them are interesting, and despite the script's best efforts, they are all two-dimensional.  The performances are awful, with the exception of Vin Diesel, who is merely average.  Walker delivers his stupid catch phrases inconvincingly monotone. Perhaps the script is much to blame here, for I've often believed that good performances are highly influenced by the script, i.e. a good actor can give a bad performance if the dialogue is bad.  Well, anyway, the dialogue is simply some of the worst in any big budget movie I've seen recently.On the plus side, the action sequences are pretty good.  However, this simply cannot make up for a senseless script and horrible acting.  Not really worth seeing, unless you really like action, with nothing to back it up.* 1/2 out of ****",kyle_c,"Jun 6, 2002"

It has been praised for the action sequences, but even those where pretty dreadful with shaky cameras and little drama or inventiveness.I was tempted to quit watching but I was hoping for some redemption but it never came.

8,It's Fast and Furious,Certainly a very fitting title. The movie does not waste any time getting started and continues on fast paced the entire way while also making you root for the characters. The story thrives less on its plot and more on the connection between Paul Walker and Vin Diesel. The secondary characters also fit in perfectly. Looking back this franchise was only made possible by the success of this character development.The scenes with the cops weren't particularly exciting but I suppose necessary to add an element of suspense of how Dom would react when he finds out Brian's identity.Despite its overall poor reviews from critics true fans know it's a classic.,ThereelscoopwithKK,"Feb 11, 2023"

Lots of Laughing gas and tricked out cars going 140+ mph. Although I am not a big fan of imports, I liked to see they did things the right way. Most cars I see like that are all show and no go. These really moved! Granted they had to drop like $80k to get them into the 10's... But there is a lot of work that needs to be done to a small engine to turn that kind of power.My hands were still shaking from the adrenaline rush 20 minutes after the movie ended.

No rating,The Silly and the Ridiculous.,"Completely empty and annoying flick made primarily for teenage boys and men who never totally grow up. ""The Fast and the Furious"" is a headache waiting to happen as undercover cop Paul Walker starts to rub shoulders with a Los Angeles street gang led by Vin Diesel (who has about as much acting ability as a cardboard cut-out). Diesel and his gang (which includes younger sister Jordana Brewster and girlfriend Michelle Rodriguez) are road pirates who hijack trucks in California and Arizona. They go after electronics equipment that they can sell to other street gangs around the city. So many missed opportunities hurt ""The Fast and the Furious"". There is a possible bond between Diesel and Walker ala that of Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino in ""Heat"", but that never does get much time because the film-makers are too busy showing off hot cars and hotter women. The movie is totally void of intelligence and its heart is as black as tar. As loud and as flashy as the production makes itself out to be, it is still amazing that in the end ""The Fast the Furious"" is really a somewhat boring experience.

8,"""I live my life a quarter-mile at a time."".","I have always loved movies which involve fast cars, so naturally I had to see this one. I definitely think that it's better to see it on video than in the cinema. I say this because I DID see it in the cinema, and I was sitting right next to a speaker at the time. My eardrums got a thorough assault, due to the roaring of powerful engines and a pounding heavy metal and techno score. But I still loved the picture. There is no shortage of action here and the performances are rather good, especially the rapidly-rising Vin Diesel as our anti-hero Dominic Toretto. Paul Walker may be listed above him in the credits, but for my money, Diesel is the main man here. The goods are certainly delivered in this film!SPOILERS AHEAD!Walker plays undercover cop O'Connor who infiltrates Toretto's gang of street racers in order to find out if they are involved in a series of hijackings which look like the work of skilled drivers. He at first is unwilling to believe that Toretto may have something to do with it due to the fact that Toretto appears to be a civil type (plus O'Connor is falling in love with his sister). It first appears that Toretto's rival, a violent, and quite psychotic, Triad-type named Johnny Tran, may be the guilty party. But this may be the easy solution. I had seen this picture before I had seen the earlier POINT BREAK, but as soon as I saw POINT BREAK, I could see similarties between the two. As with POINT BREAK, the easy answer is proved wrong and the truth turns out to be what you hoped wasn't true. The ending also has a similarity to POINT BREAK, which I won't reveal here. But these similarities do not mean that this film is not original. Far from it, the story is great with inventive twists and turns and you eventually find yourself rooting for Diesel.The two leads are brilliant as is Jordana Brewster as Toretto's sister Mia. In addition, Toretto's racing team are well drawn (well, three of them are anyway). There's Letty, the tough chick (and Toretto's girlfriend), Jesse, the geeky but lovable mechanical expert, Vince, the violent nutjob (who takes exception to O'Connor) and Leon, the other one (he has very little distinguishing characteristics). A pre-DIE ANOTHER DAY Rick Yune is truly menacing as the sadistic Tran. The cars are also brilliant. The real great ones are the Supra which thegang restores for Walker to race at an Arizona race event, the three black Honda Civics which are used for the hijackings (when did they actually start making cool-looking Civics?) and the black Dodge Charger Dieseldrives towards the end. Toretto states that he never drove the car before because itscared him. According to him, this car has 'so much torque that thechassis twisted when it came off the line', and it certainly proves itself in a final drag race near the end of the film. The music score may not be to everyone's taste, but the film is overall excellent. The sequel's not too bad either!",bannonanthony,"Jan 30, 2003"
10,More Than Just Speed,"I was immediately hooked by the adrenaline-pumping street racing sequences. The film masterfully captured the raw energy and excitement of underground racing, with the engine roars and screeching tires adding to the immersive experience.Beyond the high-octane action, I was impressed by the film's surprisingly strong character development. Dominic Toretto, played by the charismatic Vin Diesel, is a complex and compelling protagonist. You can't help but be drawn to his code of loyalty and his unwavering bond with his family. The supporting cast, including Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner, also delivered solid performances, adding depth and nuance to the story.",kudakwashemukanhairi,"Jan 2, 2025"

Ever wondered why a BMW or Porsche are powerful and won't burn out after 10 seconds? Surely not because they have a NOS installed.Story was thin as supposed, but gave me some good laughs especially in those moments when the movie tried to be serious.

10,Zoom!,"I love this movie. Not because of the cars, they could be driving Volkswagon Beetles for all I care. It was the story that made me care about the movie. Paul Walker plays an undercover detective who is investigating a group of people who street race, they are also suspected of hijacking trucks of valuable merchandise. He becomes friends with Vin Diesel's character...and his little sister, played by the beautiful Jordanna Brewster. The action scenes are pretty cool, I didn't know much about suped up cars, nor did I care about them. I still don't. But it was fun to see how fast they went. The acting is superb, with the exception of Paul Walker. He was the least interesting character. Diesel was good. Michelle Rodrigez who plays Diesel's girlfriend is spunky and has attitude. She's a fine little actress and is going places. As is Brewster, she is just lovely and gave a pretty good performance. They're making a sequel and only Walker is returning. None of the good characters will be back. So will I see it? Two words. Eva Mendes. She is the only reason I'll be in that theater. As for this movie, it's a fast paced adrenaline rush. It's an action movie with good characterzation. That's rare these days. So if you were pondering checking this movie out, you don't have to be a car fan to do it.

The film was for entertainment purposes and how people start the journey of life without knowing each other but ending up being friends as the friendship started without trust.Brian and Dominic were the main team which one wanted to watch how they succeed their mission.We saw the trust in Brian,Dominic and team(secret agents) which is the part one will like to continue watching the movie.Dominic was a unique character who always wanted to be open to others telling stories about the 10 sec and his father's race and all his past stories.Later on at the end of the film,we saw Brian and Dominic doing a 10 sec race will Dominic wanted Brian to be arrested but they after the race he changed his mind by giving him 10 seconds car.",poweraritsocceracademy,"Jan 3, 2025"
3,It's okay,"The racing is a bunch of cars going in a straight line, without much in the way of impressive driving from the characters, but I guess there's not much you really can do to make straight line racing seem impressive. They do make an effort to make it colorful and entertaining, but that leads them to make every car related point of suspense during the race sequences comically unrealistic. It's funny, but not something that caters to my interest in cars.The plot is good, but that's because this movie's plot doesn't belong to this movie. The pacing, structure, and events are all the exact same as Point Break, the only difference being that they cut 15 minutes out of the climax.So, if you're like me and you don't think Tanner pressing the accelerator in his automatic Civic SI after a long day of selling weed to highschoolers is actual racing, then all this movie leaves you with is Point Break but with cars, bad music, worse actors, and worse cinematography. This movie sucks.",Pokyt,"Jun 21, 2022"
No rating,Way 2 Go !!!!!!!!,"It has been a long while since a good racing movie. This is the best I have ever seen.

They r AWESOME.Plot is not bad, considering the things we get 2 see these days.The pace of the film never waver, giving the audience a very fast paced movie. Altogether a good, solid movie.

10,The begining.,"Wow what an movie!
What an acting by late actor Paul Walker & Vin Diesel.
Best thing I like in all f&f series is the way of intoducing new CARS. (Automobile manufacturers.)each parts of movie series are having different Sports cars!
The story tells us how Brian O'Conner meets Dominic Toretto & how their friendship bond evolves further is explained in each part of movie series.",prasanna_d_07,"Dec 5, 2019"
8,The car movie that started a trend and paved the way for so many other movies,"This movie is so memorable and holds a nostalgic place in my heart. It's got such a cool and slick style. And the stunts are off the charts - they're actually impressive. A lot of the dialogue can come off pretty corny and cheesy, but it just adds to the overall charm of the movie. This movie started a whole trend with hooking up cars and that alone deserves praise. Such an iconic movie that paved the way for so many others. The soundtrack slaps and the story is actually decent. I swear though, half of the female extras in this movie are either strippers or mattress actresses lol. And that's not necessarily a bad thing.Overall, it's a really solid movie that's a lot of fun to watch that's equal parts thrilling and exciting. Rewatching this movie for the 3rd time, I couldn't help but have the biggest smile on my face.",Kysugo,"Oct 4, 2023"
3,how is this a classic,"This movie screams boring and generic. In middle school it seemed you HAD to see this movie how good it was. Sure what was like it out at the time but still it's such a boring movie that had some potential.The story starts off by some over the top ""jacking"" of some truck that goes successful. They are in LA back when LA was much more enjoyable to live in. Where as now I wouldn't want to go to California if they paid me.Paul looks kind of out of place. His hair makes him look like some sort of Backstreet Boy reject. The first little while he looks more interested sexually in Vin who they do that thing where you don't see Vin's face for the first few scenes to add dramaticism. I don't know Vin didn't seem right for the movie. He has the look but two things he's too short and of course he can't act to save his life. His chemistry with Paul near the end works but at first almost everyone is so one dimensional in this movie that it's just a chore to go through.The cars look like some 14 year old playing Need For Speed or Midnight Club games first creations.I wonder if Ja Rule regrets being in this movieAt least there's a car explosion or two in this with an over the top use of an uzi which I am honestly wondering if a single magazine can do that to a car.The soundtrack for the movie sucks, it feels like twisted metal 3 which with only a few exceptions such as ""keep rolling"" the odd DMX and Ja Rule song for the most part I'm scratching my head wondering who they are. It's like some suburban kids iPod or whatever was on some burnt CD back when Kazaa was a thing they used. It goes from hip hop, metal to a bit of techno and the songs are so poorly placed at times.Every car relies on nitro near the end of the race. Yet I swear there was a scene saying only people who can't race good use nitro.The pacing of the movie needed some serious work for this to deserve the praise it does. Although the ending worked and the bad guy was pretty boring without ruining anything in this movie with over 1000 reviews for a 20+ year old movie which is an accomplishment as we can count how many movies we forgot or not gave a crap about since then.",talllwoood13,"May 28, 2022"

10,MY. GOSH!!! I just watched The Fast and the Furious (2001) and I am STILL REELING from the experience!This movie is like a high-octane shot!,"The Fast and the Furious is an electrifying, action-packed thrill ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish! The film's breakneck pace is perfectly matched by its stunning stunts, heart-pumping racing sequences, and an unforgettable cast of characters.Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto is absolute PERFECTION! He exudes this effortless cool, this charisma that just draws you in and makes you want to be part of his crew. And Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner is the perfect foil to Diesel's Toretto - their chemistry is undeniable, and their rivalry-turned-friendship is genuinely compelling.The supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances from Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, and Tyrese Gibson. The dialogue is witty, the humor is spot-on, and the drama is intense - this movie has it all!But what really sets The Fast and the Furious apart is its infectious energy. The film's soundtrack is a masterclass in atmosphere and tone, perfectly capturing the essence of the underground street racing scene. And those cars? Oh. My. Gosh. The cars are absolute STARS of the show!I'm not ashamed to admit that I was completely swept up in the excitement of it all - I cheered, I gasped, I even shed a tear or two (don't @ me). The Fast and the Furious is an unforgettable cinematic experience that will leave you breathless, grinning from ear to ear, and begging for more.So, if you haven't seen it, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?! Get ready to join the ride of a lifetime with Dominic Toretto and his crew!",aloismawunde,"Jan 2, 2025"
10,WICKED!,I think that this movie was one of the best that i have EVER seen.  It was so good.  It was filled with action packed thrilling ride.  It allowed us to look at all the actors and see what they're like.  I would recommend seeing this movie a million times.  I have seen it once and plan on seeing it again.  Trust me...it was well worth paying for.,renee14_2001,"Jun 27, 2001"
5,"It's decent at first, but becomes repetitive and the paper thin story does it no favours either","Brian O'Conner is sent undercover to investigate Dominic Toretto and his crew of street racers (who are seemingly involved in numerous thefts of electronic goods from trucks). However, the glamour of street racing and being smitten with Toretto's sister Mia puts O'Conner in a quandary, meaning, at times, he's never quite sure with whom his loyalties truly lie...I've lost touch with this franchise over the years I think the last one I watched may have been the 6th film in the franchise so I've decided to try and watch them one by one from the start and although this first film is touted as one of the best I have to admit to finding it slightly disappointing.There is a story here, but its so thin and practically inconsequential that it really isn't worth discussing or expanding on in any further detail so I'll concentrate on other areas within the film...The acting is hardly oscar worthy, but I felt that the cast did reasonably well with what little that they had to work with; Vin Diesel is hardly the best of actors, but his gruff persona suits the material well and he comes off as being surprisingly watchable here. The late Paul Walker has never been an amazing actor, but again did OK with what he was served up with here. Rodriguez was a ballsy girl and put on a fairly good show, but Brewster was a bit bland (then again hardly her fault when character development was so weak here). A few of the other performers were little more than weak ethnic stereotypes who I couldn't help but feel deserved better.Still where the film works best is in the chase sequences and the racing; at least these scenes are entertaining and provide the film with that much needed injection of pace - TF&TF really suffers when any kind of narrative comes in to play.I watched this film at the cinema when it was released as a very young 19 year old man. My 19 year old self was highly impressed with the film; the chases, the action, the high-octane stuff and the hot girls were enough to effectively blow me away the first time I watched this film. As a man in my early 40's now I need more than that; whilst I have no complaints with what impressed me as a 19 year old; heck these things are still good!! Nowadays I see these things as a compliment and a decent story is needed to flesh out what is otherwise a superficial and inconsequential film which is sadly what TF&TF is when you take away all the gloss and polish.I don't regret watching it again and will persevere with the franchise, but it's fair to say that this is probably one of those franchises that is likely to appeal much more to the younger crowd and much less to those, who like me, are sadly now just about creeping in to middle age.",jimbo-53-186511,"Sep 26, 2023"

4,Pure virtual reality,"Well, I was thinking a lot after seeing this movie. I was thinking why some people like this so much. Then I finally found out. Such movies are successful because they portrait the reality in the way people wish it to be. There are definitely many people who consider fast cars young chicks, adrenaline and all that other stuff around extremely cool. And this is a movie for them. Virtual reality, something that WOULD NOT HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE. The movie accomplished this task, no doubt about it. If you are in a target group - I would say that would be mostly men under 25 - you will probably like it. Fast cars, lot of racing scenes, dynamic music, clipish cinematography, easy-on-the-eyes chicks -  nothing important is missing. You will be attracted by the atmosphere of the movie so much, you will forgive it apparent non-senses, lame plot, dumb dialogues and unbelievability - but gosh, who cares, virtual reality does not have to be believable.All of us who expect movies to reflect reality at least to certain extent, and to portrait some aspects of life in original way, yes, we have to be disappointed. But we are not a target group. And makers of this movie hit THEIR target group big time, I am pretty sure about that.4/10 since I am not the target group.",pivko,"Mar 11, 2002"
No rating,This Movie ROCKS!,"The relationships in this movie ALONE are enough to keep this flick interesting. The fast cars and the fast pace do help, though. Vin Diesel's character Dominic Toretto is a likeable guy (so much more than the tough guy thug that he gets stereotyped as!) And Paul Walker is charming and believable as the in-over-his-head cop who is simply out to catch the 'bad-guy'...until he finds the 'bad-guy' ain't so bad!Yes, it's a tad cheesey, but come on! Fast cars and decent plots don't usually get used in the same sentence often! However, this movie does examine the values of loyalty, friendship and the benefits of not judging a book by it's cover!My advice? See this flick!",homiless,"Sep 5, 2002"

Guys not to fear for you there are beautiful cars, tons of action and enough suspense to keep your lady clinging to your arm.

This movie was fantastic!  Who cares about how realistic everything is? The cars look amazing, the women even better! It is slickly shot and the stunt scenes are brilliant.  Rob Cohen's DVD Commentary is fascinating.  To listen to someone talk so passionately about their movie just heightens the experience even more.  OK, so the dialogue is laughable in parts and the plot is somewhat lacking but does that really matter for this type of movie?

10,"Something has happened here, something very rare.","Something has happened here in The Fast and the Furious. Something that I have not seen for a very long time. What is it? An awesome, entertaining ""movie"". I think we need to take a moment here to look at what is going on here. Most critics are always looking for a masterpiece, or an epic. Movies like Gladiator, which are amazing, but not all movies have to be like this. This movie is meant for sheer entertainment, that is all. If you smile, get into the story a little, think the action kicks ass, and have an all around great fun time, then I think it's a good movie. That's what has happened here. I went to see this movie knowing its a hated piece of work. I mean, look at its raiting on IMDB-4.5/10. That's pretty bad. I think this is a movie that most people won't like. There is a certain crowd that will, and if you like the movie, you're in that crowd. Let me give you a list of the best parts of the movie:Vin Diesel: He is like Arnold for the Millenium. He ROCKS!!!The hot chicks: They are all over this movie, we even get a little girl on girl kissing!The cars: I'm sitting in the theater drooling over the amazing race cars in this movie.The action: It's intense, and NON-STOP.So, do you like those things I just listed? Well then, The Fast and the Furious is a movie you HAVE to see.Let me say it again: The Fast and the Furious is something I haven't seen for a long time. It's pure entertainment. And for that reason, I give The Fast and the Furious a 10/10.",Nick E A,"Jun 22, 2001"
4,"...and I thought ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" was silly!","Let me start off by saying that I have yet to watch any believable car movie in my 33 years on earth. One would think that as time went on and movie technology improves, the car movies would get better also. Not happening! This movie makes ""Days of Thunder"", ""Gone In 60 Seconds"", ""Hot Rod"", ""CannonBall Run"", ""Dukes Of Hazzard"", etc. look realistic. I know it's a movie but how about getting some pros on the set to monitor some of the situations and common terms? I am in the racing business so I may be a little extra hard to please but I'm not that tough. I want to be entertained just like the next person but I found myself being constantly annoyed at much of the movie.   Above all else, N.O.S. is one of many manufacturers of nitrous oxide systems sold in the United States. Their company name is Nitrous Oxide Systems and they are called N.O.S. for short. N.O.S. was never meant to be pronounced as a word. I wanted to put my foot through the TV everytime I heard the word ""nos"". Anyone who knows anything about street racing would know that there are many nicknames for nitrous (the juice, the squeeze, the bottle, the button, the jammy, giggle-gas, the spray or just simply nitrous) but I have yet to hear anyone say ""nos"". I guess I may hear it now that this movie came out but I can tell you it was not that way before.   Another thing, I don't think Captain Kirk ever went as fast as these guys did. The movie made the racers seem as if they hit Warp Factor 8 so I was somewhat surprised that they never made it to the other side of the galaxy during the course of their race.    What was that plate that unbolted itself and flew out of the bottom of the main character's car? I believe that this was another Warp speed type thing. I noticed in the Star Trek movies that when the Enterprise would hit maximum warp, things would start shaking and Scotty would have to tell the Captain that he's giving him all shes got so I assume that when the nitrous was used, these cars experienced the similar effects.   Have you, the reader, ever been in a drag race? No? Well, I have and I can tell you that I have yet to see one or be in one where the lead changes more than one time (aside from an engine failure or crash). We are only talking 1/4 mile here (1320 feet), not a 500 mile circle track race. I realize that this may seem more exciting to the viewer but it just don't happen.   How about that amazing wheelstand that Vin Diesel's car did? It looked like an NHRA Super Stocker leaving the line (taking off). The only problem with that is that he had street tires on it which would never grip the road well enough to transfer that amount of torque to lift the car like that. A smokey, mile long burnout would have been more true to life but then the race would have been no contest; he would have lost by a mile!   I could go on but I don't want to seem like I am being too critical. I have to admit that I was slightly entertained with the storyline. The movie is really geared (no pun intended) toward 14-18 year old males and I can understand that. Not every movie is made for me. I don't need karate and fast paced action to be entertained like our medicated, hyper-active younger generation needs to be.

5,Quickly Runs out of Gas,"Do you like car chases?  I mean, do you REALLY love car chases? You had better if you plan on watching ""The Fast and the Furious,"" because that is all it has to offer.  The movie starts off promisingly enough, but quickly degenerates into a poor copy of 1991's ""Point Break."" All they did was substitute cars for surf boards!  Of course, ""Point Break"" actually went through the bother of explaining Keanu Reeves motivation. Without giving away a small surprise, ""The Fast and the Furious"" never adequately explains why Paul Walker's character wanted to enter the world of racing.  Was he trying to advance his career?  Did he simply love the smell of new cars, and who doesn't!?!  In any event, his motivation, and several other things are left to the audiences imagination.So is this a terrible movie?  No, not really.  Plot deficiencies aside, the racing scenes are really quite well done.  On many occasions the camera moves inside the engine, and we are able to see and hear the pistons roar!  The movie plays like a two hour music video, with a soundtrack that rarely screeches to a halt.  With a deft touch, this movie could have amounted to something.  That's why the films lousy script will make you furious!  2 and a half stars out of 5.",jhendricks97,"Jun 27, 2001"
No rating,I blame the sound,"Too loud.  Any time there's a car (or motorbike) moving anywhere in the frame, we have to listen to a teeth-splintering metallic roar which doesn't get any louder or quieter - it just is.  Like the people who provided the hideous music and rap chanting that makes up the soundtrack most of the rest of the time, the sound effects guys don't seem to understand that the value of dynamic contrast: if the roar of acceleration is preceded by silence, we FEEL the acceleration.  If it's always that loud we just feel a mild throbbing pain around the ears.Most of the speeding footage (there are one or two visual conceits that come off, and that final, utterly unmotivated chase towards the end is, I'll admit, exhilarating) is also all wrong.  It's the modern vice: cut, cut, cut.  If only the director had been willing to see just one of his shots through to the end.  The computer-generated footage of car engines doesn't help, either.-Oh, and the story is one of the most ludicrous I've ever encountered (sample: the roadsters who rob trucks, when they operate at night, are covered from head to toe so that they won't be recognised; when breaking the law in broad daylight, they scarcely wear anything, presumably because they want to be recognised by the audience) ... and I wanted to like the story, I really did.  I even thought the basic situation was promising - as was the look and feel of the world in which the hero found himself.  (Cinematography is excellent.)  But the plotting is irredeemably silly, and what's worse, it gets in the way of the racing and the hotrod ambience and the views of Michelle Rodriguez and whatever else we were supposed to be looking at - just as they get in the way of the plotting.",Spleen,"Mar 1, 2002"

10,Fast and Furious,"The movie franchise ""Fast and Furious"", now famous all over the world, it's scary to believe, started with the 2001 film, which translates from the original as ""Fast and Furious"". And it makes sense. The two main characters, played by Paul Walker and Vin Diesel, appear: one as fast, the other as furious racers. In our country, this work was translated and simplified to ""Fast and Furious"". The name is loud and memorable. Now you can't get used to anything else. But then, in 2001, the film became something fresh and exciting, interesting and loud. It was then, it remains to this day.The picture was directed by the famous director Rob Cohen, whom I personally remember from such films as ""Daylight"" with Sylvester Stallone and ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"" with Jason Scott Lee. The director took a new peak for himself, putting all his talent into a gasoline action movie, where elements of thriller and drama were successfully combined.The picture will delight the audience with excellent plans, plot, good acting. Everything here is successfully combined, turning the film into a well-coordinated seamless story that is limited in time and at the same time rapid in its development. The screenwriters worked hard, giving charismatic characters who became such on the screen thanks to the excellent performance of the actors. Which is remarkable. Almost every hero of the film is still remembered. If the subsequent pictures are mixed in the head with each other, then the first film and its characters are definitely remembered. There is a brave guy - an undercover cop Brian O'Connor, an excellent antihero performed by Vin Diesel Dominic Toretto. The story is built on their relationship. Other characters are also good, played by Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Matt Schulze, Rick Yun, Chad Lindberg. Coolly written characters come to life on the screen and look convincing on the screen.The intertwining of destinies allows each character to reveal himself. We sometimes see complicated relationships within one group of friends, even family. But all squabbles and resentments are necessarily outweighed by a sense of duty and responsibility for each other. And the relationship of young people takes this film to a new level. We will see love and betrayal, true friendship and hatred, dangerous meetings and compromises. This approach to the disclosure of the character turns ""Fast and Furious"" not just into an action movie, but makes the film a crime drama, where the degree of history will increase with each turn of the plot development.But ""Fast and Furious"" would not be it in the quality in which we understand it today, if there were not that wild drive of the streets soaked in neon and nitrous oxide at night. Young people hang out here, powerful motors rattle, music plays bass, their own life goes on. And the main thing is racing. A quarter of a mile, during which there are only heroes and their cars. It was this atmosphere that gave rise to a whole culture in computer games. Which is worth only one series of Need for Speed, which is alive (but according to many dead) so far. There were a lot of other attempts to repeat the success of ""Fast and Furious"" by other creators, but it seems to me that this series hardly has competitors, although the subsequent parts changed their focus, going one way or the other from street racing, but somehow returning to the origins.""Fast and Furious"" was and remains a good movie. He lit several stars at once, gave way to young actors, made them famous. This is a great project that has already passed the test of time. This is the first and probably the most soulful picture in the whole series. Great drama, high speeds, dynamic action and a sea of exciting emotions.10 out of 10.",alekspredator87,"Oct 27, 2022"
5,Point break with cars,"Despite being a great advert for various makes of cars, this is not a bad film. Forget the plot  the cars (and races) are most definitely the stars here. Paul Walker is the young motor enthusiastic with a taste for speed who strives to prove himself to street racing icon Vin Diesel and his gang of race crazy mates, not forgetting his very sexy sister!

It's just plain fun. It has some great action scenes and some great one liners. It's not going to win an Oscar, I can guarantee you that, but it will entertain and it never gets boring. It may be stupid, it may be un-realistic, but it has a reasonably good storyline and it's just fun to watch.

Just like if you don't understand politics then you wouldn't enjoy political movies. The acting in this movie was done almost to perfection. The actors draw you into the movie because they DO talk like people usually do. Now I don't know about you, but I hate watching those movies where when someone is about to get shot, they come up with something crafty and clever to say. That's just not how it is in real life. And Hydrofuzz, if you didn't want down to earth acting, then why go see movies that are based on reality such as the Fast,instead of movies based on fantasy? And this movie is based on reality, trust me, I used to street race, and so did alot of my friends.",big_pun53,"Jun 21, 2002"
10,One of the best adventure of movies,Fast and furious is one of the movies featuring one combined talents that include Vin diesel and many more they took to the track to and the races were one of its kind.The cars were those that have the best engines and were very fast as the name of the movie suggests. I enjoyed this movies so much that i dnt regret my time i sused on this movie. Fast and furious is a mivie which is recommendable to others it features one of the best actors and yu feel the urge to continue watching the police officees were so swift in carrying aout their duties though there was destruction of many cars but the movie was the best.,maridaniset,"Jan 2, 2025"
10,What I thought,"Here is what I thought of the fast and the furious. The reason why I was interested in this movie is first Vin Diesel, he is a very talented young man and I enjoy his work. Second, Michelle Rodriguez, she is also very talented and I loved Girl Fight. Also the preview just ""wow."" The previews are the one thing that motivate me. Fast and the Furious has kick a$$ cars and a great cast. The movie is excellent. I gave it a ten, cuz that's what it deserves.",BriNi145,"Jul 7, 2001"
5,The Original Low Deck Kickstarter,"Ever since the release of The Fast and the Furious in the summer of 2001, the franchise has become one of Universal's biggest in recent years. With over 10 movies in its lineup and countless big names behind it, it's proven to be a marvel as far as down to earth street action flicks go. So how does the original one hold up?In the film, an undercover cop named Brian O'Connor is tasked with discovering the identities of a group of automobile hijackers led by Dominic Toretto. From that premise alone, the general plotline is fairly predictable and goes for a similar theme of family we've seen in other action dramas. However, what the movie does offer outside of its routine premise is its testosterone. Given how pumped up audiences must have been back then, one's adrenaline could immediately rise with all the fast cars, tough men, ferocious women and Vin Diesel. Anyone who has risked motor law to just let out their inner road demon with friends could relate to the muscle bound ferocity shown on screen.As for the late Paul Walker, even though one might expect him to have a cold heart as Brian, his chemistry with the low charismatic Diesel allows for some genuine emotion to come out of an otherwise brainless street action flick. While the other people in his family vary from temper to temper, the heart of it all remains Dom and his sister Mia, Brian's tight fisted albeit tender love interest. With all the struggles Brian has to maintain undercover, this would have to be the more heartbreaking aspect all around, yet the movie never forgets to make up in thrills and gut wrenching drama.So if you're more into the street racing than the film's attempts at human interaction, than the original Fast & the Furious does what it needs to do best: put you into a world where commercialized motor vehicles are like demons on a long road. If the franchise has gone on this long being more balls than brain, why stop now?",elicopperman,"Mar 18, 2022"
8,A genuinely great B movie,"..and I really mean that. I was very pleasantly surprised to find that its scorching visuals and enormous kinetic energy were backed up by a fine, sympathetic performance by imposing Vin Diesel and, overall, what I like to call ""a good heart"" --a film that isn't nihilistic and bitter at the core but has humanity and a sense of values. I had no trouble understanding why our cop hero, himself once in trouble with the law, slowly gravitated away from his chilly bosses and toward the vitality and warmth of the street racers' family unit, with its backyard picnics, protection of weaker members and strong internal loyalty.  I won't go into a lot about the plot, not because it doesn't have one but because you don't need to know: just know that if you get sick of movies where people do bad things for no reason, this one will make you feel better. And do NOT leave before the credits!",angelynx-2,"Jun 24, 2001"
5,Was that Paul Walker or Keanu Reeves?,"Boy, Paul Walker sounds JUST LIKE Keanu Reeves.  I kept thinking of ""Point Break"" the whole time I watched this movie, expecting Detective Brian to ask his superiors ""So you're saying the ex-presidents are surfers?""I distinctly remember seeing the trailer for this movie in front of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and for the first few seconds after seeing Vin Diesel, I was excited about it, but by the end of the trailer, I was a little worried.  So I finally picked this one up at the ol' rental store on DVD and gave it a whirl.Not bad.  Not good, but not bad. Vin Diesel gives a good performance, and I guess you could say Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez do, too, given their limited roles.  But Paul Walker -- what are casting directors thinking when he walks in to audition?  This guy is bad -- plain bad -- and he brings the movie down, down, down.But silly me, talking about the performances of the actors, when this movie is plainly about the performances of the vehicles.  And perform they do. All the driving stuff is pretty fun in a campy sort of way; I especially like the way the different cars tend to drive in some sort of formation, as if they were the Blue Angels or something.  All the racing parts balance against Paul Walker's terrible delivery of his lines to bring the movie up to an acceptable level.",adamp-6,"Jan 16, 2002"

Car movies aren't for everybody, and if they aren't for you then you shouldn't see this movie. But I am a car person...so I LOVE THIS MOVIE!  It is hands down, the best car movie ever made.  Gone in 60 Seconds was a major disappointment.  And it's been a long time since we had a really good car movie.  The Wraith in 86' was the most recent example I can think of.  But anyway...we aren't here to talk about that.  This movie is great.  If I had to give it a complaint it would be the lack of exotic cars.  But if you realize the story of the movie, they aren't really appropriate to the plot.  Again, if you like cars at all, you will love this movie.  What a rush!",Jason60,"Jun 23, 2001"
10,Adrenaline-Fueled Fun,"The 2001 film ""The Fast and the Furious"" marked the beginning of a beloved franchise that would go on to become a global phenomenon. Director Rob Cohen's high-octane action movie brought together a talented young cast, including Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, and Paul Walker, to create a thrilling ride that would leave audiences breathless.The story follows Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), an undercover FBI agent tasked with infiltrating a group of high-stakes thieves in Los Angeles. Led by the enigmatic Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), the crew is suspected of hijacking trucks and stealing valuable electronics. As Brian gains the trust of Dom and his team, he finds himself drawn into their world of street racing and high-speed heists.The film's action sequences are undoubtedly its strongest aspect. The innovative use of handheld cameras and clever editing creates a visceral, immersive experience that puts the viewer in the driver's seat. The street racing scenes are electrifying, with a memorable soundtrack that perfectly complements the on-screen action.While the plot is somewhat predictable, the cast's chemistry and charisma make up for any narrative shortcomings. Vin Diesel, in particular, brings a commanding presence to the screen, making Dom Toretto an instantly iconic character.In retrospect, ""The Fast and the Furious"" was a groundbreaking film that helped establish the ""fast car"" genre. Its influence can still be seen in many modern action movies, and its legacy continues to thrive with the franchise's subsequent sequels and spin-offs.",tawandajisaac,"Jan 2, 2025"
4,You've GOT to be kidding me...,"Cute guys in hot cars, that's one thing, but bad acting and poor editing? Unforgivable.  Not even Vin Diesel and Paul Walker looking all tan and squinty-eyed could save this FLOP.  Walker and Diesel were average (I've seen them both do much better), and the rest of the Team was pretty good, but what was up with the cops and the FBI? Wooden, stale and boring.The day fading into night scene was cute - the first time!  It was like the cinematographer skimmed through the ""Filming for Dummies"" book the night before shooting began.Oh, and Ja Rule in his break out performance?  Puh-leeze.  He should stick to ""singing"" the hooks for Jennifer Lopez and Ashanti.I gave it a 4 out of 10 for the guys and the cars.",filmcrit-2,"Jul 18, 2002"
9,"""It doesn't matter if you win by an inch or a kilometer, the important thing is to win!""","""The Fast and the Furious"" is a great opening film. A crazy movie full of moments that get you pumping. The idea of street racing is so cool! The introduction of what is currently one of the most iconic franchises in the history of cinema is really well made. They have very well introduced the plot of the saga, the characters are fantastic and I love them to madness, especially now that I have seen these films so many times that I know them by heart. Dominic is a badass and I get so excited and played by Vin Diesel is literally an iconic god of cinema. But Brian is my favorite character and I think it's influenced by the presence of Paul Walker, who I love so much. I loved Mia, Letty, Jesse, Vince and the others, too. I liked the fact of inserting a short plot with a simple and therefore excellent writing, so as to give maximum minutage to the automotive action scenes, the true essence of the film. Cohen's direction is good, and so is photography. The rhythm is almost excellent, you will not get bored practically ever, especially for the choice not to last even this saga an infinity of unnecessary hours but to make the visions pleasant and smooth. The music is great and intersects perfectly with the plot and the setting is also great. The costumes are perfect for the film and I especially love Toretto's ouftit. The ending of the film is great. One thing not to be underestimated and that makes the film even more beautiful is the presence of fabulous machines with aesthetics out of the ordinary. After this vision I reassessed the film even more positively, now I really know it by heart, but from how much I enjoy this saga, each time I will watch it as if it were the first..

No rating,"Do it fast, Do it furious","I just wanted to say, I am a huge film freak. I have a great deal of respect for some of the greatest films of our time. I love films that have great twist and wonderful acting. But I am human and I have to love films like this. I might love higher quality films. But I do love big action films and rediculous plots. But the difference is I don't go into a movie like this looking for it to be a classic. I expect stupid dialoque, bad acting, and so on. And that is what I got. AND I LOVED IT. That is the main problem with the major movie critics. They don't see it as a fun, stupid film. I do.      One actor that has had my eye for about a year now is Vin Diesel. He has yet to be bad in anything I've seen him in. Plus, as soon as I saw ""Pitch Black"", I new he was not only the biggest bad ass in movies in the past decade. But he really can act. And I respect him for that.      I can't say the same for Paul Walker. He has always sucked. But I wish that Michelle Rodriquez wasn't in this movie. She just seemed like she was a new version of her ""Girlfight"" character. Her main point in the movie was to look cool and make an angry face at the guys. But I did like Jordana Brewster. I think, with the right material, she could be a great actor.      For anyone who saw ""Point Break"", this film is basically the same plot. Just change surfing into street racing and there you go. But I must say. I like this film a lot more than I liked ""Point Break"". Mainly because I have a personal grudge against Keanu Reeves (minus ""The Matrix""). And, Paul Walker may suck, but he's better than freakin' Keanu Reeves.      The action sequences in the film are all top notch. The first heist scene is very cool. And the last one in the desert was my favorite. Of all the car films lately (""Driven"", ""Gone in 60 Seconds""), this one is definatly the best of them all.      I will no doubt go see it again.

4,The longest ad I've ever seen,"I think I watched this movie for the same reason many others watched the movie: we wanted to see them fast cars. And there were lots of them. The drag racing scenes were definitely the best but after several of them it kinda gets annoying when you're sitting there wondering where the hell did these kids get the money for the cars. Finding out who's been behind the robberies is pretty easy to figure out as well.Ok cars were ok but the relationships between the characters was not believable. I don't think that Dom and Brian connected so closely as to warrant what happened in the end. And the romance between Brian and Mia seemed to have come from no where. I believed  Mia and Leon's love/hate relationship more.If you have time and money to spend or maybe you got a free coupon from blockbuster, go ahead and watch this film. It won't really change your life or make you think but it may make you want to save up for a 80,000 car to drag and destroy. What fun.",cassidycane,"Jan 22, 2002"

4,Hot chicks & cool cars...,"...yep, it's a guy movie all right.""The Fast and the Furious"" is the movie that made street racing popular (at least here in The Netherlands it did) But is it good movie? I think not, i found it pretty disappointing, maybe it was because I set my expectations for it too high.The movie is nothing more then a remake of ""Point Break"" with cars, set in the 00's and is aimed at the teenage viewers. The story is pretty simple and to be honest I didn't liked it, I wanted to see more racing instead of focusing on the undercover mission of Brian. So basically I'm saying that the movie would have been better if it didn't had a story at all!The characters and the atmosphere can be described as ""cool"". I actually like the acting in this one and I'm one of the few people who thinks that Vin Diesel is actually a pretty talented actor that just wastes his talent by playing only cool macho guys. Watch ""Saving Private Ryan"" to understand what I'm talking about. And Ja Rule actually acts better then he sings, but I don't know if that's a compliment.The car scene's are all right but it didn't gave me the adrenaline rush I wanted and the were to little race scene's for my taste. The movie does have it's moments, but overall it's disappointing.All in all only watchable if you like cool cars and fast racing. I just hope that the second one will be better.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Boba_Fett1138,"Jun 22, 2003"
No rating,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ONE,"This movie was the most worthless 8 bucks I spent. Paul Walker (one of today's supposed ""hot young actors"") is so overrated it isn't funny. The man acts like he's reading from cue cards. Second, anyone that puts Ja Rule in their movie isn't actually looking to make something worthwhile, but rather looking to draw as many young kids in, as possible without any effort at filmmaking. The mass public that is teenagers, which have no taste in movies whatsoever, will enjoy it because it has fast cars, hot chicks, and half-ass rappers. This is what films have come to these days. Put some fresh faces and maybe a ""rapper"" (i use that term loosely) or 2, add some lame scenarios and the usual action elements, and come out with a totally uninspiring and predictable film.I'd say more but I've already wasted too much breath on this horrid film.",drewing22,"Sep 27, 2001"

8,N1,"""Fast and Furious 1"" represents one of the turning points of modern action cinema with its adrenaline-fueled scenes, captivating storyline, and unforgettable characters. The film splendidly presents viewers with the passion for speed, friendship, and family bonds.The charisma of Vin Diesel and the attractiveness of Paul Walker are among the crucial factors that connect the audience with the characters. Scenes featuring car races and perilous missions elevate the tension to the highest level, while the film's music impeccably supports these moments.However, the presence of certain clichés and predictable elements in the film stands out as a weakness in terms of originality. More emphasis could be placed on character development, and certain dialogues could have been deeper. Moreover, by providing more information about the backgrounds of various characters, the universe of the film could be further enriched.In conclusion, ""Fast and Furious 1"" offers action enthusiasts a gratifying experience with its action-packed scenes and characters. Nevertheless, addressing the clichés and deficiencies in character development could be considered to thoroughly refine the film.",uhudsavascisi,"Aug 17, 2023"
4,"Hit the brakes, this ride is awful","""The Fast and the Furious"" was never my cup of tea; not in '01 and not today. I do admire the purity of its sales pitch - fast cars and hot babes - but my problem is that the film takes itself way too seriously given the subject matter.Hoo boy, some of the dialogue in this movie; along with the frenzied editing of the racing scenes (I'm guessing they were going for ""supercharged""), it is unbelievably cringe. It's like there's a decent movie in here somewhere, but it just needed to go full camp and avoid the dramatic elements. They do not work.Maybe it's what they did to that Charger that was so offensive. By that point, I guess I'd had more than enough. I would definitely argue that this is an outstanding time capsule of the nascent '00s, with all of the music styles and fashion that that entails (yikes), but I just want to watch Point Break instead.",Mr-Fusion,"Apr 12, 2022"

10,Great movie,"He Fast and the Furious (2001) It is solid decent action film of the film franchise. I love this film it is my third favorite film in the series. I wasn't watching this film for the cars or street races this film is about robbery, as a string of high-speed electronics truck robberies rocks the area. The Team stole $1.2 million worth of major electronics and the cops doesn't have any leads who has done it. There is only one team that could be responsible, Dominic Torreto (Vin Diesel) and his gang of street racers. During the night Torreto and his crew of street racers are driving cars in Los Angeles. Brian O'Conner (Paul walker) a undercover LAPD officer under the alias ""Brian Earl Spilner"", is he assigned to find out who is stealing the merchandise.This is my favorite film, it is an decent Action film about heist $1.2 million and not about the cars. Why I love this film? Because It is clever, intelligent, Entertained, fast paced and not boring film. The girls are beautiful in this team. The Action sequences are real and perfectly done. I love that late Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner and undercover L. A. Police Officer who try's to do the right thing. I am Paul Walker fan and Brian O'Conner is my favorite character of the whole franchise and series. I am saying The Fast and the Furious is better than 2,3 and even 7 so the film is pretty good.",itaimudyiwa,"Jan 2, 2025"
3,"""The Stupid and the Ridiculous"" Would Be More Accurate","This is one stupid movie! I wasn't expecting great art or anything, just a fun summer movie. But this movie is nothing but loud -- yet excitement-free -- car races and a lot of people posing.  The plot is a note-for-note rehash of the Keanu Reeves movie ""Point Break (1991)"" although with cars instead of surfboards & parachutes, and much more ineptly done. (And Keanu, as bad an actor as he is, could act rings around the awful lead of this flick.)  This does have Vin Diesel -- but as good as he is in anything, it's not enough to elevate this mess.  With this, someone has achieved the unimaginable: they've actually made a movie that's dumber, more abrasive and more annoying than the Jerry Bruckheimer version of ""Gone in 60 Seconds"".  This is easily one of the worst studio films of the past year.",Don_Mac,"Jan 7, 2002"
10,Adrenaline Rush,"Does just what it is supposed to do ... give you an adrenaline rush. Players are well cast for the parts. Subtle digs on police and FBI so listen to the dialog well.

4,Just a bonch of hype,This is not very good. The characters make chooses that do not make sense. The story line is awful. 2 fast 2 furious is a good movie. The fast and the furious Tokyo drift is also a good movie. Fast and the furious new model original parts is also a good movie. Fast five is also a good movie. Fast and the Furious 6 is also a good movie. Furious 7 is also a good movie. The best thing about this movie is if it had not been made the sequels would not have been made. 6.7 is overrating it. That is not a great film. I give 4. This is pretty bad. D.R no is a lot better. I like most action movies. I do not like this one. D.R no is great. From Russia with love is also a very good action movie. See that movie. Do not see this.,jacobjohntaylor1,"Mar 6, 2017"
No rating,Bad A$$ Movie!!!,"Alls i gotz to say is this movie was a bad ass movie.I'll tell you since I know alot about street racing b/cause i do race,the stunts and the cars were off the hook!!I loved Vin Diesel(Dominic Toretto).I am the BIGGEST fan of Vin.he is HOTT,fine,sexy,good looking,and i better stop b/c i could go on and on.Nobody is a bigger fan then i am.The movie was great,and the people that were in it were so good for their part.The one part that got me fired up was when Brian(Paul Walker) busted in on Johnny Tran(Rick Yune) and his gang.But the one part that i was mostly looking at was the way Letty(Michelle Rodriguez)and Dom.(Vin) were kissing.I loved how he lifted her up by her ass.It had a good plot and a good climax.I just can't wait till the sequal comes out.I'm just mad b/c the main person i wanted to be in there is not going to be in there(Vin Diesel).I'll tell you don't worry about all them haters out there that say it was dumb,boring,stupid,etc...don't worry bout them just keep doing a good job with the movie it was great trust me.I'm an expert on all this car racing stuff and it was GREAT!!",la_gigglez06,"Jun 9, 2002"
9,Let The Truth Be Told...,"For a movie that didn't have any superstar actors/actresses, this movie was certainly a must-see.  The cars were hot, the girls were hot, and the plotline was actually pretty decent.

8,The Coolest B Movie ever made,"This is a B movie to the ""t""!  Bad acting (except for vin diesel), cheesy lines, unoriginal story, but a fairly original subject matter for a movie... Street racing.  And did I mention revolutionary/AWESOME direction of action and racing scenes.   The last 5 minutes of the movie alone are worth the money to see this movie.  It leaves you with one hell of a WOW feeling. The movie features ""new"" car racing, that is mostly Asian Cars suped up with nitris oxide or premium engine modifications to make them extra fast. Only at the end do we see the highlight of the film an old hot rod that leavez you droolin at the sound of it's revving. This movie is pretty much an exact remake of Point Break except with Street racing the subject matter instead of surfing.  But the storyline and plot are good enough to get you through to all the action/racing scenes which are incredible and groundbreaking. The director does an awesome job with the action/racing scenes.  The new cool way the race scenes are filmed can be compared to the new cool way the fighting scenes were filmed in the matrix (except no special effects here). The movie has a certain element of pazzaz and the race scenes and the action scenes in general are well done and suspenseful as hell.  You gotta see this movie.",superfly_tnt1,"Jun 27, 2001"
4,A Very Loud Street Racing Movie,"Any movie that can make Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez look like decent actresses should have succeeded, but it unfortunately didn't. Paul Walker was just starting his career and was a little rough and Vin Diesel gives his usual grunts and groans performance. The movie is loud, but what would you expect from this type of film. It basically proves that fast cars, and fast women equal fun.In this film you have teenagers around 16-19 who have high performance cars, but give you the impression that they couldn't screw in a light bulb without help, and somehow in the film the police are nowhere to be found despite the roar of 800 horsepower engines.A minor diversion, but a movie that makes no sense.(*1/2) Out Of (****)",HawksRevenge,"Aug 12, 2006"
No rating,Nice action-movie but with a cheesy script,"There are a lot cool things about The Fast and The Furious, but the script lacks originality and it's uninspired. The cool things about Fast & Furious are of course the top tuned cars, the beautiful shots, and the good sound/music. It's all about street racing with ""ordinary cars"", but mixed in with a crime and love story. The shots are really nice, if not impressive but the story is still filled with clichés.

For this reason, it is crucial to avoid combining business and pleasure. The majority of undercover police officers often become so consumed in their assignments that they lose sight of their objective. Brian began establishing a relationship with Dom and Mia in an attempt to gain their trust, but the more he learned about their family's devotion and upbringing, the more he desired to be a part of it.

There is nothing redeeming about the story and it offers absolutely no insight on anything meaningful.That said, whenever I find this movie on my on-screen cable guide, my fingers inexplicably move the cursor to it and press ""OK"".  Maybe there's something about brightly-colored cars, hot chicks and revving engines that affects me on a subconscious level.  Maybe it's the cutting-edge soundtrack or Vin Diesel's bald head.

9,The First Film of the Beginning of an Era,"""The Fast and the Furious 1"" is a film that satisfies enthusiasts of action and speed. The performances of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are among the elements that make the film exciting. However, it falls short in terms of screenplay and character depth. The story generally progresses in a clichéd and predictable manner. The dialogues also feel somewhat artificial and shallow. Nevertheless, with its intense action scenes and visual effects, it manages to captivate the audience. While the film provides an enjoyable spectacle for fans of speed and adrenaline, it may lack depth for those seeking more substance.

3,YES! Modern movie making had reached a new low!,"Why I let my friend drag me to this movie I do not know. I guess I was bored and had absolutly nothing else to do. Its strange that the weekend I came into school after seeing this all people were talking about was this movie, PATHETIC. It really reminded how low people's look on movies are today. Plot was a cliche linear ""thing"" about some racer ""thiefs by night"" and the cop trying to stop them. Dialouge was terrible and people who say the cast was fine don't have any idea, Sean Connery and Brad Pitt couldn't save this movie in lead roles. Except then we'd have decent acting. The only reason I brought myself to giving a three was for 1. The Cars, (I know, that goes against what I was saying, but the stunts were well done, and 2. The floresent lights under the cars because it made we want to put a pair on my car.

No rating,Depends on what ur looking for in a movie...,"This movie wasn't for everyone... to tell u the truth, i loved the movie but it really didn't have much of a plot (other than a cheesy one) and there were some moments of bad acting, but being that this is the first movie involving the import scene I thought it was a pretty good first shot, because things need to be said and cars need to be seen ;)... Personally, I liked it because I am involved in import racing (doesn't always have to be illegal u know!!) and thought that this movie shows how, in the import scene, race doesn't matter, gender doesn't matter... it's all about friends and all about enemies, and most of all its about loyalty and going places very, VERY fast!",DreaminInTypeR,"Jun 20, 2002"
10,What a great movie,"How can you not like this movie?  It has hot cars, hot women and some very cool stunt driving.  What more can you ask for in a movie?  Yeah there might have been some parts that were a little too predictible but the action was great and made up for any of that.  For the critics who said it was just a movie about racing cars they couldn't have been more wrong.  The whole story line behind The Fast and The Furious was great, when you first watch it you are suprised to find out Brians (Paul Walkers) real job, and then the chase sceene at the end where Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are chasing Jonny Tran and his cousin through the town was amazing.  The best part of the whole movie has to be when Diesel unleashes the monster of a car (the charger). All in all it was a great movie that you can never get sick of.",Bravezfanatic,"Jul 6, 2002"
8,Looking back,"When the Fast and the Furious first appeared it was an awesome film to watch. The cars and street racing scenes were new and exciting. After watching Tokyo Drift and Torque a couple of years later it is clear that the original spawned an entire new genre of action film. The new genre clearly plays on the clichéd teenagers dream of racing fast cars through busy streets. Street racing in real life is sadly lacking compared to these films and fatal accidents seem to happen a lot more frequently. While the original and Tokyo Drift have upped the ante, the other films such as Biker Boyz and Torque are very disappointing. We should probably be used to that now though because its the ultimate Hollywood cliché...",demon-drifter,"Feb 9, 2007"
4,Ach du lieber! Terrible! TERRIBLE!,"Oh mein Gott, I just kept hoping that this movie would end!  And it was over 100 minutes long!  Oy!  That was about 90 minutes too long.  Paper thin plot (if one could call it that) and lousy wooden acting a la Tony Danza make for a terrible, ignorant movie.  It was the opposite of the ever-heinous ""chick flick""--a wicked dopey, testosterone-y guy flick, and an unbelievably bad one.  Save your time and money--watch anything else.",MFerris65,"Dec 5, 2002"
10,"Good movie, except for the ending!","I saw this movie the day it came out and I gotta tell you, it was a great movie.  I mean, this movie promises what it delivers.1.  Wonderful cast of people (Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, & Michelle Rodriguez).2.  A hip soundtrak (feat. Ja Rule, whose in this movie for one scene only).3.  And most importantly, kick ass cars with wonderful chase scenes.The movie begins with a truck with boxes full of stuff and gets taken by a gang.  The next day, Brian (played by Paul Walker) goes to eat at a diner and meets Mia (played by Jordana Brewster) and Dominic (played by Vin Diesel). Then, he gets in a fight by one of Dominic's guys and gets kicked out of the diner.  The following night, Brian goes to a race against Dominic and other guys. After he loses, the cops come and Brian saves Dominic from jail. Then, Brian goes to a party and falls in love with Mia.  The biggest surprise for Dominic and Mia, Brian is a cop whose working undercover. 
I don't wanna give the rest away, but, the car scenes were extraordinary, but, the ending wasn't really that good, but great performances from the lead actors and actresses.I'd recommend this to anybody who would enjoy a movie with great cars.A- ***** stars ( out of ******) 90/100",videofreak2002,"Jul 21, 2001"
5,Unfortunately so average...,"Cross Point Break with Gone in 60 Seconds - and you get this one. Boring, predictable, unoriginal; good-looking good guys, bad-looking good guys, really bad bad guys and really good bad guys. BORING as boring can be. The dialogue is so pathetic, one feels sorry for great actors like Diesel who probably were not allowed to change the dialogue and say it better. I CAN'T BELIEVE this film... I have to admit though that most of the actors are pretty good (should be especially hard with a dialogue that primitive and the film so predictable in every single moment.) Also, the last few scenes are much more dynamic and interesting and dramatic and have at least SOME degree of unpredictability (not like anyone wonders in the last few minutes about Brian and what he will do, huh?) Also, Jordana Brewster after an incredible start in The Faculty never got any good roles (I hope someone will make a Love Story remake - she would get an Oscar for that probably), but COME ON - one hears/sees Yale and her intellect in every sentence, body move, smile, etc. - what the... would this girl be doing as a waitress/homemaker to her driver brother? Anyway, I'm pretty disappointed but I don't think the film is bad - it's just average - nothing one would expect from these actors - would have been pretty good for category B movies. I hope Brewster and Diesel get better in picking scripts (or agents) next time. I still think they (and Walker) are really good actors. Good luck to them but not to the folks who made this film. Sorry, you guys have no business making films - unless of course everyone is looking for repetition of the same old in every single film...",epsylon1,"Jul 19, 2002"
No rating,The best film ever made about racing cars!!!!!,The Fast and the Furious is by far my favorite movie. The thrill and intensity of all that torque put to use sends chills up my spine.

4,A great movie for the audience it's made for,"For all the car-buffs, and teen guys who like to see shiny Rice-rocket cars zooming under trucks and intense action: forget what the critics have said about this movie. The plot was actually better than i expected. Who went to see this movie and expected a flawless script and good acting? It's a teen movie! When i went to go see it, i was mainly concerned with the action. This movie is great to test your new home theater sound system on. It's a bad movie if you're looking for deep dialogue and characters that you can directly relate to. This is a good ACTION movie. I particularly enjoyed the photography and race sequences that were everything i expected from the previews. Forget about analyzing this movie like Roger Ebert when you see it, and instead just sit back with a couple of friends around the bigscreen and ""ooo and ahhh"" over the action, throw popcorn at the screen whenever the bad guys come in, and drool over Paul Walker. I gave it a 8 out of 10 just for the rush it gave me. Ignore what everyone has said. See it for yourself and judge.

3,Uhhh...can someone tell me where the good actors in the movie are?,"I was disappointed with this movie, when I wasn't watching the beautiful cars blazing through the streets; which, by the way, there weren't enough of.The first problem with the movie was definitely the cast. Vin Diesel committed career suicide (in my eyes) by acting, or should I say taking the spotlight, in this movie. I'm a fan of Vin Diesel, mostly because of his role in ""Boiler Room"". But who the hell let Paul Walker into this movie? If it weren't for his looks I don't believe he could have made it into the acting business; there is no discernment between his character in this movie, and all of his others. While I was watching ""The Fast and The Furious"" I had to check and make sure it wasn't ""The Skulls"" or one of the other extremely terrible teen movies he's been in. He is not an actor, all he does it say his lines from a script written from him...but where was the heart in his performance(if you could call it that)?This movie was so terrible that the second time I tried to watch it, suggested by a friend who came over the next night, I fell asleep. The plot was so thin I thought I was watching a bunch of Anorexic(SP?) teen movie ""stars"" trying to make themselves look like actors.The only other decent actor I could find in the movie was Rick Yune, whose part was not nearly emphasized enough... poor Rick. But for the racing scenes, I thought they were great... every time I listen to The Crystal Method I feel like hopping into my friend's Honda 2000, cranking up the NOS and heading for a straight stretch.I give this movie only a three. In fact, it only got the three BECAUSE of the cars, the races, some of the music, and the few beautiful females. It could have received a four... but the the females had to keep their clothes on. I don't suggest anyone with a need for some intellectual stimulation watch the movie, unless you're extremely high or in need of material to make fun of.  For those of you who really loved, and got caught up in this movie...man, it isn't even worth my time to scold you.",za_kenshin,"Jan 30, 2002"
No rating,"Yes, it's fast and furious, but it's also an audiovisual assault. *1/2 (out of four).","THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS / (2001) *1/2 (out of four)By Blake French:""The Fast and the Furious"" is not a movie as much as it's an audiovisual assault. I suppose you can call it a motion picture because it consists of moving pictures flashing before a large screen, but movies are a form of the arts, which exist to please people. ""The Fast and the Furious"" is not pleasing, involving, or entertaining. Some people might enjoy it because of all the car stunts, crashes, chases, and intense action sequences, but that's all this production has. ""The Fast and the Furious"" should have a medical alert warning on its poster: ""This film is not for those faint of heart."" Not because of high octane suspense, but because it attacks our senses from all angles-to an unhealthy level. The booming, nauseating soundtrack demolishes our eardrums while our sight becomes desensitized by all the gratuitous violence and testosterone-laden fist fights. This isn't entertaining-it's violating.
This is the kind of movie that throws logic into the air to concentrate on stupefying the audience with unconvincing action. There's a scene where a cop speeds down the streets of LA in his car while firing a gun at an accelerating motorcycle. First, there would be more people on the streets of LA. Second, I do not think a cop would jeopardize the lives of so many innocent pedestrians by opening fire on a moving object.Actor Paul Walker reunites with his ""The Skulls"" director Rob Cohen. (I will give Cohen credit for one thing: ""The Fast and the Furious"" is a whole lot better than ""The Skulls,"" but that's not saying much.) He stars as an LA cop named Brian, who's working undercover to investigate a frequent string of truck hijackings.The prime suspect is Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel from ""Pitch Black""), a buff, tough, and rough dude who spends his days working at a tune-up shop and his nights drag racing high speed cars. Brian decides to earn the respect of the racer. Toretto's excepts Brian as his right-handman. Brian also falls for an attractive young woman (Jordana Brewster). Here's a surprise: the girl is Dominic's sister. ""You break her heart, I'll break your neck,"" explains Dom to the humbled Brian. I wouldn't second guess him.The one-dimensional, unsympathetic characters explain most of the plot to us, but their dual explanations feel like an intrusion to the copious action sequences. When they do speak, it's only in clichés. Don't worry, though. These scenes are few and far between. Most of the time the characters speak in actions, not words. Sometimes that can work to a movie's advantage, but not when the actions are violent impulses and obvious plot motivations.""The Fast and the Furious"" occupies no surprises, no involving character relationships, and no memorable lines of dialogue. After the movie, I defy anyone in the audience to quote a single line of important dialogue. You probably couldn't either, because there are no important lines of dialogue in this movie. A few moments do induce some much appreciated suspense, but before we become too interested, the production abruptly cuts to the next scene.Naturally, ""The Fast and the Furious"" contains some eye-popping, jaw-dropping car stunts. This movie is a surefire hit with fans of such movies as ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" and ""Driven."" The action sequences are indeed intense and well accomplished, and I also admire the work by Vin Diesel. These positives make the negatives even more apparent. With the decent material present, it's a shame the movie as a whole is so utterly pointless.
""The Fast and the Furious"" is yet another prime example of how movie producers hold back on the material to warrant a lower rating. In this case it's the PG-13. The rating greatly limits the violent and  sexual content, and the language the street gang uses is anything but realistic. Some movies are born to be R-rated, like ""The Fast and the Furious."" But gutless producers want their movie suitable for all audiences, thus the movie is more likely to prosper in the box office. I'm sure I speak for many when I say that I felt cheated out of a more edgy, provocative movie.
I like the title, though. ""The Fast and the Furious,"" they got that right!",Movie-12,"Jul 12, 2001"

10,I am in awe at the acting of Scott Walker,"The Fast and the Furious ranks near Varsity Blues as one of the greatest movies ever made.  Although essentially the exact same movie as Point Break, the casting brought the film over the top.  Swayze was replaced by Vin Diesel, Reeves by Scott Walker, Lori Petty by Mark Wahlberg's wife etc.  I will admit that there were some minor, (fine major), plot holes, but when Vin Diesel pumps up the fine Brocksonic stereo nothing else matters.  Scott Walker, star of such classics as Varsity Blues and She's all That, put in his typical Oscar quality performance.  His portrayal of an undercover officer looking for some lovin' brought tears of joy upon my face.  I urge all of you to see this movie at the tenplex in Paramus, there you can find the optimum crowd, as that is half the fun of this movie.Also the cars are nice, but I would have prefered to see my Jeep Wrangler with the top speed of 45 mph in the film as well.",mules82,"Jun 25, 2001"

Had a nice little preview with fast cars and well, fast cars. I think it came out shortly after Gone in 60 Seconds. Which was a good movie. This one is, well, a movie. Your call as to whether it's good or not.Brian O'Connor (Walker) is an undercover cop who poses as a street racer. His assignment right now is to watch Dom (Diesel), who is the main suspect in a high-tech ring of highway robberies. We don't know who the bad guys are in this movie for a while, but eventually we find out that it is in fact Dom and his crew doing the highway robberies. If you haven't seen it and I spoiled it for you, my apologies. Hopefully that'll keep you from watching it now.I don't think the plot goes much deeper than that which I have just mentioned. This movie is about two things. The babes, and the cars. There's quite a few of each that are very good looking. For the most part the cars are better in this one though.I'm not really sure what else to write in this review. That's how much the plot is weak sauce. I mean, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker have to hold this movie on their shoulders. And who do they get for backup? Ja Rule. Good grief people. Couldn't we find one decent actor? Guess not. Really, if you ever bother watching this movie, realize right from square one that this movie is not about the plot or the acting. It's about the big zoom zoom that the cars make. If that floats your boat, rent this. In my estimation you'd be better off giving Gone in 60 Seconds a look.Bottom Line: 2 out of 4 (I wouldn't bother)",schmimic,"Apr 23, 2005"
No rating,"Better than ""Gone in 60 Second"" (At least you will enjoy it)","Not as expected. The film is more entertaining than I thought. But the acting suck, they all are too stiff. But what do you expect when Paul Walker act as a cop (he not even suit the role) and stiff muscle guy like Van Diesel, who barely can't even walk himself but become an excellent speed driver. Only Jordana Brewster did look really stunning in this movie. After all, it really worth a watch, especially for the cars lover and for the person who love fun car chase movie and hot chick. No plot though in this movie. But sure enjoyable. Max: 6.5/10",Mr_Sensitive,"Nov 26, 2003"

8,Toning Down Movie Content,"Although I do not know where they ""toned this movie down,"" (I didn't see the DVD) as one user complained, I know why.  It's not about pleasing people, or if so, that is just a small part of it.  If this movie was rated R, the viewers would be restricted to just adults, and it is in many ways the perfect movie for the teen/young adults.  Just like if ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was NC-17: if this was rated R, a lot of potential money would have been lost. The only difference is that ""Eyes Wide Shut"" sucked badly, and needed extra nudity to help us men forget about the plot and direction, whereas this movie was still pretty good.  And people still see R movies.  Most theatres don't even show NC-17 movies.  I suppose there's nothing you can do about censorship except hate mail the MPAA, whom are really just trying to please the soccer moms and republicans of America.But, yeah, I want to see this movie again. Haven't seen it in a while.",Mr Nuff,"Feb 8, 2002"
4,"I smell skanks  The Fast and the Furious","Ah, The Fast and the Furious, the film that launched the careers of Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, and, for all intents and purposes, Michelle Rodriguez, (yes she starred in Girlfight previously). This foursome was so hot after this movie that some of them couldn't demean themselves by starring in the sequel. Poor them as, just a short eight years later, they all jumped at the opportunity to reunite with fast cars in the fourth installment. Oh how the mighty fall, especially when they weren't too mighty in the first place. I had my own preconceptions about this popcorn flick, virtually making me never want to take a chance on it at all. I thought the acting would be amateurish and campy, the story ludicrously absurd, and the cheese factor too high to overcome. Well, after finally sitting down to check it out I realized that I was clairvoyant. I wanted to at least have fun, and for a couple moments I did, but overall this Rob Cohen disaster is a throwaway that only shows how influential teenage boys are in the Hollywood spectrum. How else could we have three theatrically released sequels to what could be a made-for-TV movie at best? I see the similarities to Point Break, as my friend told me existed. It even goes to the point where if I closed my eyes I could have believed Paul Walker was Keanu Reeves. Where this film goes wrong, though, is by having Brewster's character involved, taking Walker's love away from Diesel. What works so well in the before-mentioned Kathryn Bigelow film is that there is more than just allusions to a man-crush between Reeves and Patrick Swayze. That dynamic doesn't quite exist here. Walker's Spilner/O'Connor may respect Diesel's Toretto, but he never idolizes the man. He sees a misguided soul that watched as his father burned to death on the racetrack, he sees a man who is nothing without his sister and racing team—his own makeshift family. Whether it is Toretto who is behind the truck-jacking or not, Walker is only staying close to find out, and get with Brewster's Mia of course.Speaking of the truck-jacking, is it just me or is that opening scene completely out-of-place? The film begins with four Hondas harassing a trucker, taking the driver out and, I guess, stealing the shipment. The cut is so abrupt that you never do find out what they do with the cargo, if anything. In fact, having the next scene in daylight with Walker, I thought maybe he was involved already, waiting for the criminals to meet up with him. Instead, he just floors his car, swears, and is all of a sudden at Mia's diner. It is so discombobulating that I seriously wanted to just turn it off. Only when Walker goes back to work at Harry's do we find out why he swore driving, and it's even longer until we find out where the trucks come into play. But this isn't trying to win awards for storytelling, it's just doing its best to entertain and titillate. Unfortunately, it did very little of either.The acting is pretty horrid across the board with Rodriguez probably the best of the four in a limited role. I didn't mind Diesel too much, the guy has charisma, but Walker's Keanu-speak was distracting because I don't remember him ever talking like that in other films. And when the cast is rounded off by stilted delivery from Rick Yune, Ja Rule, and Matt Schulze—the moment when Brewster asks Walker out and Schulze elbows the wall in anger made me laugh—you know you shouldn't be expecting very much else. Although, Chad Lindberg, as the whiz-kid engine technician, showed a lot of promise. I guess even the most asinine of films has a diamond in the rough somewhere.If anyone reading this has wanted to see it, don't let me stop you. I'm the first to admit that I have never seen the appeal of cars, either in their speed or in their look. The Fast and the Furious is all about the cars, so it had a pretty large strike against it from the beginning. I also don't particularly care for action films devoid of a strong story. That said, however, I had a fun time with the trucker's revenge sequence at the end watching Diesel attempt to save Schulze. It all kind of gets ruined with Vin's ""anger"" afterwards and his blind rage for payback against Yune's Johnny Tran, but at least one high-octane moment kept my interest. It's a good thing too because the ending is as abrupt as the start, answering all questions about where our two leads' relationship will go with wordless looks and nods. These two understand each other; they are kindred spirits who have opened their souls. One is a hardened criminal and the other an undercover cop, both with the streets to unite them. No loose ends are sealed and the fate of many is left unanswered. I'd love to see how Walker explains who was stealing the electronic equipment to his superiors. The filmmakers probably never thought a sequel would be imagined and felt pretending it didn't matter would be enough.",jaredmobarak,"Jul 12, 2009"
10,Sweet as hell,I thought that the action was great.  It had a good story line not just fast cars.  The cars were very nice too.  I thought that the acting was very good.  The actor that played Dom was a very convincing character as well. Thought it was the best movie I have seen since Chariots of Fire.,foxxylady1117,"Jun 24, 2001"
2,The testosterone reaches critical mass quite early in this ridiculously self-indulgent nitrous oxide orgasm.,"Paul Walker gets his breakout role as an undercover cop, one with very little interest in actually doing any police work, who falls in with a crew of enterprising gear heads on the midnight street racing circuit. Vin Diesel, the headline costar, takes on his usual character: a growling, flexing, ultra-chill bro with shady connections but an open heart. Neither are particularly likable or interesting. The whole thing is shallower than a toilet bowl, ticking so many ""cool point"" boxes that it mimics a rich, forgettable, three-minute music video. We've got fast cars, gorgeous sex objects, adrenaline-rich action scenes, loud radio hits (juuust a bit dated) and a posh location or two. Not much in the way of meaningful character arcs or deeper substance. It's a true ""what you see is what you get"" experience. Big and dumb and gruff and insecure, with a plot that varies from meaningless to pointless and a versatile cast with nothing to do beyond gripping the steering wheel (or each other) and looking sexy. On this first go-around, at least, the action retains some passing association with reality. Points for that.",eminkl,"Apr 17, 2020"

10,something for everybody,"some people said they loved this movie and some said they hated it,but personally i thought it was great!!there are hot people(both guys and girls),fast cars,and a good plot despite what some people say.it's called the fast and the furious because of the street racing and the life that comes with it!the whole movie couldn't just keep showing races cuz it would get too boring so they had to add the plot in of brian o'conner becoming friends with dom.it was predictable in the part that everyone knew that dom was the one doing the hi-jacking and not johnny tran.it did show somewhat of an insight though.paul walker went undercover with one view point and came out of it with a totally different one!he saw what a pretty tight group they were and that was the only life they knew.the only  thing that bothered me was when vin diesel flipped the charger at the end and he came out of it with only a cut on his head!! they couldn't have ended it with him dying though cuz it would've been stupid. i think the reason they really didn't show what happened to paul walker and stuff at the end was because they knew there was gonna be a sequel and they were leaving it up to that!! i can't wait for the sequel and i hope it's just as good as the first!",chbeagle,"Jul 21, 2002"

3,"Hey! Let's copy Point Break, only with cars!","I have never seen a more blatant ripoff of another movie in my life. The makers of this flick took the plot of Point Break and used cars instead of skydiving and surfboards. Let's see -- instead of Keanu Reeves (the worst actor of all time, BTW) as an undercover FBI agent we have Paul Walker as an undercover cop. Instead of Patrick Swayze as the cold guru who takes the undercover FBI agent under his wing we have Vin Diesel as the cold guru who takes in the undercover cop under his wing. Instead of the ex-girlfriend of the guru falling for the undercover cop it's the younger sister of the guru falling for the undercover FBI agent. Instead of an ending in Australia it's in Mexico. Instead of robbing banks they rob trucks. Pathetic. I can't believe how many people actually liked this lameexcuse for a film. Gee... fast cars... too bad there are only 3 races scenes in the entire movie -- TOTAL. Nevermind that one of them is between the Japanese guy and the clueless fool of a friend.Lame, lame, lame.

The result of this movie made me to be happy.

4,Cut the chit chat. We want to see racing!,"If I were alive in my full senses in 2001 and had seen The Fast and the Furious, there is no way I could have possibly thought that this film will turn into a full blown franchise in the coming years. I mean the whole concept of these films is basically the cutscenes of a Need for Speed game. But still since I thought probably this franchise is supposed to be about something other than that too, I decided to give it a watch just to prove myself wrong. And I was wrong. This franchise isn't just about the racing. It's also about talking, talking and even more talking.The Fast and the Furious is not exactly a kind of a film that I would call memorable. The only scenes I remember from it are the beginning where Brian does the illegal street racing, the part where his secret identity is blown up and where the team is doing the truck stunts (I only remember that part because of the meme template). Other than that when it comes to this film, my mind literally goes blank. And wouldn't it be? I was watching it without subtitles in the metro while travelling for college. When I do this I only remember the most memorable scenes from a movie. From here I only remembered that much.I really liked the character of Brian. It's really sad that Paul Walker is no longer with us. He's literally the reason why I decided to continue watching this franchise, otherwise I'd have given up just like I did for Stuart Little, Hotel Transylvania and Jurassic Park. Thankfully this franchise becomes better with the sequels and redeems the name. I also liked Dominic in this film (but just this one). His dialogue about not mattering whether we lose by an inch or a mile really made me ponder a lot.Honestly this really goes above my head how a film with so much talking turned into what it is today. It's like if you don't give up on a bad film you can actually create an empire and then redeem your old films (looking at you Warner Bros). This film has gained a cult status among the fans and I respect that decision. I would have loved to rewatch this film to prove myself wrong, but remembering how much talking happens in it and the fact that it doesn't have the same payoff as a superhero or sci-fi movie really turns me off.",Puroo,"Sep 23, 2021"

5,Fast cars...bad acting,"As others have already said, I didn't have an interest in seeing this movie, even though my friends always made a big deal about it. The only way I was seeing this movie was if I didn't have to pay for it, which I didn't.  I enjoyed the fast cars, because, I like fast cars.  I am sure that this movie, and the sequel which is scheduled to come out next year, will forever be a cult classic amongst the import-race car enthusiasts.  Yet, those people will watch the movie not for the amazing acting or directing or writing, but for the fast paced car scenes.  This is the way I would only watch this movie again, just to see the fast cars. Vin Diesel was boring, monotone, and simply unbelievable as a person.  His speeches were well rehersed, but they came off as phony and unemotional. Paul Walker was perhaps the best actor in the movie.  I have seen him in other films so I know this wasn't his acting high point. I would have to blame the director and/or the writer for this.  Walker had his moments, but there were some very lame ones too. There were too many points in the movie that left me hanging. Diesel's character and the leader of the Asian gang exchange some words early on in the film which builds the tension and the excitement for the rest of the movie.  The whole time I am thinking that we are going to see a hard core drag race match-up between the two characters- and we never do.  We see a fist fight between them, but it isn't what I wanted.  It wasn't what the film pumped up.  The final scene was just about pointless and useless for the film.  Nothing was resolved. A drag race and a car is demolished.  Out of everybody, we know that one person is dead, another wounded, a couple MIA, and nothing is certain, or even hinted at what the future has for the two main characters.It had good editing, and good cinematography, but that can't make the movie. Bad acting, bad directing along with a bad script simply made the movie bad.  I give it a 5 out of 10, only because I wanted to see the cars, and wanted to see if it was going to get any better. I was really anticipating a nude scene, or even some more skin with Michelle Rodriguez, yet that never happened either. I was disappointed by her role as well, since I had heard all this excitment about her in the movie.",seod1999,"Jul 16, 2002"

Were we to assume some kind of Flintstone locomotion was in effect.  Did anyone notice that the lead good cop was a blonde white guy and all the baddies were either Hispanics or Asians?  Did anyone notice the bullet spraying, speeding and being chased by cops never lead to an arrest?  Did anyone notice the overall tone of lawlessness was celebrated?  What an uplifting, socially aware movie this was.  The special effects were of ""Dukes of Hazard"" vintage.  Vin Deisel was passable in his role. Paul Walker was forgettable.

The stunts we very good particularly the part where Johnny's cousin wipes out on his bike, its very realistic looking any very convincing. The direction in this was great. It was everything you want in a car movie. Those of you who trashed this movie know nothing about cars and don't appreciate them.

10,Fast and Furious,"""Adrenaline-Fueled Action and Heart: The Original 'Fast and Furious' (2001)""The 2001 blockbuster ""The Fast and the Furious"" revolutionized the action genre, combining high-octane racing, heart-pumping stunts, and a gripping narrative that explores the world of street racing and organized crime.Director Rob Cohen's vision brings the underground racing scene to life, with stunning cinematography and pulse-pounding action sequences that will leave you breathless. The film's soundtrack, featuring a mix of hip-hop and electronic tracks, perfectly complements the on-screen action.Vin Diesel shines as Dominic Toretto, the charismatic leader of a street racing crew, while Paul Walker brings a sense of vulnerability and determination to his portrayal of undercover FBI agent Brian O'Conner. The chemistry between the leads is undeniable, and the supporting cast, including Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster, add depth and complexity to the story.What sets ""The Fast and the Furious"" apart from other action films is its ability to balance high-stakes action with genuine emotional resonance.

The movie deals with L.A. street racers and an undercover cop who's investigating the leader of this group of racers who may be involved in a string of highway truck robberies. The plot has been rehashed from other films, but it's the action that really get your attention to the point that you could really care less about the plot. It gives you everything you could ask for in a popcorn summer flick. I was pleasantly surprised.Another thing that surprised me was how good the acting is in this movie. The young cast of Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, and Michelle Rodriguez do a fine job, but the real star of the movie is Vin Diesel. With his steely gaze and Lee Marvin-like voice, Diesel has a mixture of machismo and vulnerability that commands attention. He is an actor to watch.",sharif68,"Jul 27, 2001"
3,"A script, a script, my speedster for a script!","One of the worst films I've seen in the past decade. When one character asked the other ""What do you need"", I answered aloud: ""A script!"" I couldn't tell for sure which was worse -- the script or the delivery. The plot is a snoozer (and poorly worked-out at that) and the acting parochial. Fortunately, I saw it at the one-dollar movie house, so I didn't waste much money.",bassocantante,"Oct 24, 2001"
10,Worth The Ticket Price,"The Fast And The Furious is a thrill ride from beginning to end.  The heart pounding action made me squirm in my chair.  The cleverly filmed racing sequence was amazing and from that point on my eyes were glued to the screen.  Although the plotline isn't very original they carried it well. Vin Diesel, who played the roll of the street racing leader, gave a strong performance and you could really feel for each character.  I even started feeling sorry for the evil Japanese gang leader.The semi-jacking scenes were awesome.  They totally freaked me out... in a cool way though.  I didn't know what to expect.  Paul Walker's acting was pretty Keanu-ish.  He was a total surfer boy throughout the whole movie. The make-up people were trying way too hard to make him look rugged and normal.  It was pretty hard for me to believe HE was a cop. He's way too boyish and cute for the part.  But, I have to admit, those looks of his were one of the reasons I wanted to see the movie. In the end it came together really well. I suggest that you don't wait for this one to come out on video because you will be missing so much.  With the surround sound of the theater, the engines mixed with the soundtrack and the plot work great together.  I went in expecting a B+ and i got blown away by an A+++++++ movie.",ttjam,"Jun 22, 2001"
10,Action packed,"One of Vin Diesel's best movies,i really loved it
. A movie about a passionate team (who do such work that, in real, should be done by authorized officers) in a mission to loot a wealthy coward or say culprit (in the sense someone who loots the sincere innocent public, to make huge earnings), with each one in the team shown to be good, or say talented, in specifics.. Such concepts are rare as much as I know..This is probably one of the best movies in Fast And Furious series. Action sequences and Car chase sequences keep you on the edge of the seat. The movie sticks to it storyline and there's great acting from the whole cast.",nduleli,"Jan 2, 2025"
3,Don't believe the hype!,"Was this movie suppose to be good or even taken seriously?  This was not a good movie.  The worst thing about it was the plot, which sucks to high hell.  I haven't seen trash like this sense the early 90's.  This movie has action and some drama, but it's all so predictable.  Don't expect to be surprised.  I feel so sorry for Rodriguez for doing to film.  She's a pretty good, but she's had much better parts than this.  So, if you like movies about people fighting over who as the fastest car, car stunts (computerized car stunts), and a ""Point Break"" story line, then you will love this.  For the people out there who want something fresh and exciting, stay away from this garbage.  So many people told me this was their favorite movie.  What have they been watching?!",jgusw,"Oct 15, 2002"
10,Wow,"This was a great summer movie. I laugh at all of the negative comments about the silly plot. One look at the preview should be enough for those people to know to stay away.Vin did a great job, as he always does. And those cars, talk about cool. People who complain that they use crappy import cars should realize that these are the cars that the real kids (many of whom were in the movie) that race use.Stop your whinning, go rent Citizen Kain and leave the driving to Vin.",TKOS,"Jul 6, 2001"
5,For the Series on a whole,"The series is garbage. It's a giant bore of annoying car chases and storylines.I never liked this product. Whenever I see another Fast and the Furious trailer I cringe.Then they added the Peoplez Chump. It looked worse with A Rocky. FAF looks like it got smacked down at the smackdown hotel. Then got turned sideways and got stuck up in a New York City's garbage dump back side.
Then they added more WWE Grapplers to it.Please no more. At least I'll say this the 1st one was at least barely decent. Then they added like 5 more. Why? FAF is not good.Verdict: For the Too Slow and the too terrible.This movie is a 5 the series is a good 2.",ThunderKing6,"Feb 15, 2021"
10,AWESOME!,This movie was soooooo awesome!! Its now one of my all time favorites!! Plus it was by far Vin Diesel's best movie!! The car were also really cool! All the actors did a great job!! The stunts were so cool!!! Especially at the end!! The only problem was that I didn't like the end very well...but its still an awesome movie!,princessb1369,"Jun 27, 2001"
10,like cars and racing ?? Then what are you waiting for,"I am a big racing fan and I like beautiful cars.  That is why I think this is one of the best movies in theaters for the moment.  The storyline is as follows:  a cop has to infiltrate a street-racing gang to solve a few thefts on trucks.  But he starts to like the racing a little bit too much and isn't so sure anymore who is the real badguy.  Excellent movie with some amazing cars, you cannot tune them more, and great acting.  For all you car freaks out there, a must to see !",snake-eyes,"Sep 2, 2001"

5,hows about Slow and inane for a new title?,"wow - that was one of the more painful silly movies that I've put myself through lately. This movie dragged - I found myself wanting to fast forward through large sections of the movie. The plot was as see-through as cellophane. Vin Diesel cannot act and should not have been cast as the lead Torreto. He was not convincing and he was as wooden as my front door. There were very few actors in this movie that I felt were worthwhile in watching. The dialogue was so boring that it made the movie feel incredibly slow. It was like Point Break except in cars. This story has been done - and done much better I might add.
The one thing that I will say for this flick, the cars were pretty neat. I definitely am forgetting this silly action flick - glad I wasn't the one who rented it.",cjdouglas,"Jan 7, 2002"
10,Amazing!,When my friends wanted to watch the movie - it seemed to be a mistake to join them. But well i must admit that i had to alter my opinion. Fascinating action sequences and beautiful women.

4,Not bad for what it is.,"Let's face facts.  You don't watch a movie like ""the Fast and the Furious"" for a compelling story or memorable characters.  You watch this movie to see cars driving around, really, really fast.  So how is it in that department?Pretty darn cool.Hot rods, motorcycles, trucks, all look very cool in this movie.But then, I'm not a car person.  I'm an ""Okay, you can have some cool action sequences, but they have to involve interesting characters and be part of a larger, more exciting story"" person.  So, from me, this movie got a four. You may want to add a point there if you just want a big, dumb car chase movie.",La Gremlin,"Jan 27, 2002"
8,The Fast and the Furious Zoomed Out of the Gates,"As an avid fan of the series I am going to be unbiased here. This was a fantastic first movie of the franchise that really set the tone for the films that would follow.

3,MTV,"It's a movie about a bunch of cool dudes wearing cool clothes and cool haircut and driving cool cars. The camera work and sound editing is also meant to be cool throwing way too much of everything at the audience. And if this was not already enough coolnest, here comes the cool music. The flavor-of-the-week soundtrack is a mix of all the teenager cool hip-hop and cool new-metal hits. It's loud and constant. It's sometimes hard to hear the actors deliver their cool one-liners. The entire thing looks like a cross between a car ad and a sexy MTV mega-hits video. I guess I'm just not cool enough. 3/10.",SalutToi,"Jul 24, 2002"
9,This Is a very good Entertainment Movie,"When you wanna be relaxing or when you pay a theater ticket you expect an entertainment movie and this first movie of the long saga of Fast and Furious lived up to my expectations !!!!The story telling is pretty nice and interesting, you wanna find out more about them, like more the past of Brian and Dominic, the actions scenes are amazing and really crazy I wondering how they can do making this movie with of barely 38 million is nothing of all great action scene.They got very managed the fact of mixing car racing and privacy life in the script, some scene are laugh too, the shoots of LA are beautiful and last 25 minutes are crazy and fun especially for action movie fan !I'm so exiting to discover the next stage of the franchise. If you want an entertainment movie is all good Go on !!!!!",tomlaju,"Apr 10, 2024"
3,Nice cars but too slow,"How can a movie about cars be so slow? The director must have been asleep at the wheel. There is nothing to rev up your engine, other than mean chick and hot sister. The cars look nice. I give it 3 stars because of the color and the two hot chicks.",xfpro,"Aug 18, 2020"
8,Perfect Balance,"Not a film that makes a big mark, but I do have to admit they have a good balance in it. There was a good mix of action, girls, romance, car racing mixed in with a bit of a plot. The movie isn't deep or Oscar winning. With so few movies out there that touch on street racing I was impressed with this film. I loved all the cool hot rod cars and the racing. It's fun to see Vin Diseal taking on the role as a Gang Leader, with his expert racing. Fast and the Furious is a fun film, not a serious one, but fun.",AngelHonesty,"Dec 31, 2020"
10,Both Sexes,"If you think that this movie is only for the male population ladies, think again. This film, The Fast and The Furious, had its female points of interest as well as the male points of interest. If you still don't believe me, go out and see it, it is worth the money the theaters are asking us to pay now.",roxy0613,"Jun 23, 2001"
5,Fast & Predictable.,"Just when you thought that perhaps the movie wouldn't continue down it's inexorably predictable path anymore: It does. Suspense and surprise are thrown away in this movie. It also really doesn't have a really good race until the very end of the move, by which time you are merely waiting for the movie to finish in the unbelievably 'made to a Hollywood checklist' way that it does.",Spence-10,"Jun 27, 2002"
8,What do critics know?,"I thought this movie was awesome!  Gone in 60 seconds was okay, but this is no comparison.  When I first saw it advertised I knew that I was going to spend my $5.  The attention-grabbing, high-speed racing and chases were put together perfectly.  The soundtrack will be a must have as well.  I am not sure why the critics dogged it so much.  It appeals to the age group that spends the most money on movies.  It was loud, fast, adrenaline-pumping action that kept everyone's eyes glued to the screen.  I am a female who LOVES cars and this movie just made me want to be a race car driver.  So don't let Rolling Stone magazine and other newspapers determine whether you see this movie or not.  This movie fits our generation and you can't help but leave the theater with a smile on your face and feel the urge to shout, ""Yeah!!""Oh, and people did drive out of the parking lot with screeching tires after the movie.  I even saw a few old cars doing their best to show off the wild nerve this movie struck in it's fans.  Okay, so I did it too.  Hey, I have a 2000 Eclipse, I couldn't help it.",purple_dreams,"Jun 23, 2001"
5,Fast cars? Yes. Good plot? No. Worth Watching For the Sake of the Cars? Maybe. You Decide.,"The Fast and the Furious is a pure adrenaline filled action movie. A real tough guy film. Fast cars, great stunts. The works. Unfortunately, this can't completely make up for the other mistakes.  The casting of the Fast and the Furious was pretty bad. Vin Diesel can't act. People like him because he's tough. Some said he's the next Schwarzenegger. Yeah right. However, that's not what ruined the film. It's simply everyone else. Paul Walker is horrible especially. Michelle Rodriguez (Resident Evil) is okay. She was better in Resident evil. Somehow though, all these combinations were horrible. The plot itself is just stupid. Anyone seeing this should focus on the stunts and cars, because obviously that's what the director did. I mean, it's one of the most predictable movies ever. And the ending was pretty dumb(though not as bad as it could be.) Another thing about THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS is the rating. The rating board must have been pressured by the company who released THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS into a PG-13, because this film should've been rated R. I was reading a review a critic wrote, and he said that two male teenagers in front of him said, ""Man, that should've been rated R."" The critic said he couldn't agree more. Same here. Not even the small amount of violence in this film should make it R, but the language(I counted at least 3 F words), and the street racing. After this movie was released I saw on the news that some percentage of car accidents had gone up. I forget how much though.
Still, does all this make the FAST AND THE FURIOUS a pass? You can decide for yourself on your own taste. I personally, even if it was stupid, am glad for watching it just for the races, cars, and the HUGE stunt at the end. Other than that, I wouldn't watch it. But if you like cars and stunts, and really big, adrenaline pumped guy movies, than I wouldn't pass THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS UP just for the stupid stuff. It's not incredibly bad, because the above I mentioned makes up for it. It's a hard vote, but I'll give it a 3. Not for a film as a whole, but for the small sequences I loved in it. 3/5 stars.",MovieAddict2016,"Aug 1, 2002"
10,Modern Day Rebel Without a Cause,This was a real good flick.  Never boring with lots of action and some interesting twists.  I never really knew where this film was going and who might betray who.  Also the acting was very good even to the smallest part. James Dean Lives and even the nervous mechanic was much like Sal Mineo in Rebel Without a Cause.  Great movie.,mrskywalker,"Jun 29, 2001"
10,The Fast and the Furious (2001) - 10/10. Period.,"Before the globe-trotting, submarine-fighting, and space-faring escapades that define the later chapters of this franchise, there was a humble street racing flick that captured the hearts of a generation, and it's still just as potent today. We're talking about the OG, the one that started it all, the 2001 masterpiece that is The Fast and the Furious. It's a film that exists in a glorious, simpler time, a time before Spec Ops missions and world-ending stakes, a time when the biggest problem was figuring out how to beat your rival in a quarter-mile.What makes this movie so damn good? Let's start with the heart of it all - the characters. The relationship between Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker, may he rest in peace) and Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) is pure magic. It's a classic forbidden romance, the undercover cop falling for the sister of the man he's investigating. Chemistry practically bleeds off the screen, and their interactions are both sweet and genuinely relatable. Then there's Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), a man with a shadow of a past, a code of honor that rivals any knight in shining armor. He's tough, brooding, and fiercely loyal, and his troubled but ultimately good heart makes him imminently captivating. And let's be honest, who didn't instantly like Brian? He's the fresh-faced newbie thrown into a world he doesn't fully understand, and his journey from clueless cop to a part of the family is one of the most satisfying arcs in the whole series. And let's not discount Mia - she's the glue that holds this whole operation together, keeping the temperamental men in check and providing a much-needed sense of groundedness to their world. She's smart, kind, and fiercely protective of her family.Beyond the characters, the movie is just dripping in early 2000s Badassery. The soundtrack alone is a time capsule, a perfect blend of hard rock, rap, and electronica that perfectly encapsulates the energy of the street racing scene (Shoutout to Ja Rule, Limp Bizkit etc !). It's the type of music that makes you want to rev your engine (responsibly, of course). And then there are the cars. Oh, the cars! From the sleek JDM imports to the muscle cars with chrome galore, every vehicle is a character in itself. These weren't just cars; they were symbols of freedom, speed, and counter-culture. The visuals are undeniably iconic, with those neon-lit races and the camera work that made you feel like you were right in the middle of the action.What's remarkable is the simplicity of the plot. It's a straightforward story of betrayal, loyalty, and the bond of family, with high-octane racing thrown into the mix. It doesn't try to be anything more than what it is: a fun, adrenaline-fueled ride with characters you genuinely care about. And that's why it still works, even 23 years later. It was watchable in 2001, and it's still undeniably entertaining in 2025. In fact, it might even get better with age, becoming a sort of vintage classic that serves as a reminder of the series' humble roots.For me, The Fast and the Furious is always in the top three of the series, and it's not just nostalgia talking. It's the perfect blend of character, action, and atmosphere. It's lightning in a bottle, a cultural phenomenon that captured the spirit of a generation. It will forever hold a special place in my heart, not just as a Fast and Furious movie, but as a truly great film. 10/10. Need I say more?",douglasc11,"Jan 2, 2025"
2,Garbage,"I remember when this came out and I remember being bored even back than. Bad acting, with a bad plot, followed up with bad action sequences. This is the kind of movie 10 year olds love to brag that they've seen because it was pg-13. How this spawned so many sequels I will never know.",acnine,"Mar 17, 2022"
10,Classic,"""The Fast and the Furious"" isn't just a movie-it's an adrenaline rush that kick-started one of the most iconic action franchises of all time. Directed by Rob Cohen, the film blends high-speed car chases, intense action, and a gripping undercover story that keeps audiences hooked from start to finish.At its core, the movie follows Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), an LAPD officer who infiltrates the underground street racing scene to investigate a series of truck hijackings. His path crosses with Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), the charismatic and respected leader of the racing crew. What sets the film apart is the chemistry between Walker and Diesel, creating a compelling dynamic of loyalty, rivalry, and friendship.The action sequences are thrilling, with street races that pulse with energy and stunt work that pushes the limits of practical effects. The cars-muscle-bound beasts and imported tuners-are as much stars of the film as the actors. Coupled with a killer soundtrack, the atmosphere immerses viewers in the raw excitement of the underground racing world.While The Fast and the Furious is an action spectacle, it also explores themes of family, trust, and belonging. This emotional undercurrent gives the film a heart that resonates beyond just fast cars and explosions.It's easy to see why this film became a cultural phenomenon, launching a series that evolved into one of the most successful franchises in cinema history. For fans of action and racing, The Fast and the Furious is a must-watch-a thrilling, fun, and unforgettable ride.",greytay,"Jan 2, 2025"

The story was pretty good, they talked like people really do in society today, and they had great stunts.  If you buy one movie in the next month it should be The Fast and The Furious.  Oh yeah, and it doesnt matter if you win by an inch or a mile, winning IS winning.",Bears_Forever,"Mar 30, 2002"
10,Incredible!,"Being a part of the import scene, I was extremely nervous about the release of ""The Fast and the Furious"".  Visions of riced-out Civic's running 7 second quarter miles danced through my nightmares for weeks on end.  We even went out and rented The Skulls (with Paul Walker) and Pitch Black (with Vin Diesel) just to see what the acting was going to be like.  We had already seen The Faculty, so we knew what a hotty Jordana Brewster was.You cannot imagine my relief on opening night, as we emerged from the theater.  IT WAS INCREDIBLE!  There were very few ridiculous antics to be seen anywhere in the film.  My beefs are as follows:Civics driving under big rigs.  Totally unrealistic.  But come on, this is Hollywood.  It looked cool, just let it go.They lead you to believe green non-turbo Eclipse is turbocharged.  Anyone associated with the industry knows all about that Eclipse.  It has been in magazines and is well documented.  The film makers even admit to the fact that it is a non-turbo, yet still proceed to tell you it IS turbocharged and even dubbed in blow-off valve noises when it shifts.  But again, its a MOVIE.  We have actors pretending to be things they are not, so what is the difference if they pretend the car is something its not.Paul Walker's acting.  From time to time in the movie, he really nails a line and conveys incredible amounts of emotion.  (Like the scene where he and Dom are eating lunch alone together)  But other times his delivery is just plain flat.  (Like where he offers up his pink slip to race)  If you just focus on the acting of Vin Diesel (which was just awesome) you should be able to overlook Paul Walker's short comings.They had to bring something illegal into it.  Well, apart from the fact that street racing is illegal in the first place, that is.  I am sure there is someone, somewhere, who street races and IS in fact a criminal.  But the way it is portrayed in this movie is just ridiculous.  But again, this is Hollywood we are talking about.  If there was nothing like that going on, there would be no plot.  Just be happy its not drugs.Nitrous Oxide was over used.  Especially on turbocharged cars.  Anyone who has ever tuned a turbocharged car knows that it is no small task. Maintaining a safe air-fuel ratio while maximizing power is tough.  Adding nitrous-oxide into the mix (which requires additional fuel to go with it) is damned near impossible.  Only the top of the line professional racers pull it off as a large power adder and do it safely.  The fact that almost every car in this movie has both a turbocharger AND nitrous is just ridiculous. HOWEVER.. with that being said, it definitely adds something to the suspense of the race scenes.  It gives the director the ability to make someone appear to be losing a race, and let them hit their NOS button at the last minute to start a come back and make it close.  So although it is a bit unrealistic that so many people would run nitrous oxide, it adds entertainment value to the film.So thats it!  The movie was extremely well done.  The editing is great, and there are some parts that really keep you on the edge of your seat.  It is by no means predictable, either.  There are many parts of the movie that could really go either way, and the director does a great job of keeping you in the dark until the scene ends.  The interaction between Brian, Mia, and Vince was great too.  You could feel the love Vince has for Dominic and his crew, and that he really feels he is protecting them from Brian.The characters are believable, and you really find yourself caring for them and what happens to them.  The action is great AND believable (if you can overlook a few minor things).GO SEE THIS MOVIE!  In fact, I am about to go see it again right now.",baugust1,"Jun 24, 2001"
3,Not good,"Forget all the articles of how this film franchise contributed to racing deaths on the freeways, it's just a terrible movie.This film has all the factors in place to create a cinematic nightmare. The 'plot' was paper-thin; a four-year could determine the outcome within three minutes. The acting, writing, and cinematography were of the lowest caliber. Movies like this, those that are god-awful, but rake in tons of cash, are a cry for help from this generation. They are uneducated, and will swallow, hook line, and sinker whatever the studios throw at them.",seanyun,"Sep 29, 2021"
10,This was a good racing movie,"Over the years, the franchise has smashed box office records, increasingly ridiculous action set pieces, amusement park rides (Yes really!), and of course aforementioned hilarious memes!Though ego maniac Vin Diesel and others claim the long-running series will end after the tenth instalment, which has now recently been broken into two separate parts for some reason, I'm honestly convinced this franchise will never end...Call it NOS-talgia if you'd like, but the original Fast still has its charms that have lasted all of these years!Part of the joy of this film is that, in comparison to all of the other entries, it feels so small in scope and scale.Imagine if the sequels never happened, this would probably be a fun little relic of the early 2000s!In actuality, it's where the seeds were planted for the characters that continue to stick around.Most of the series' iconic hallmarks are already here on display; the BBQs, the familia, and yes, the Coronas!Give the film credit for actually being fairly character-driven, despite the action-heavy scenes.",shanemtetwa,"Jan 2, 2025"
10,The Best Car Movie Ever Made And The Third Best Summer Movie Of 2001,"This is by far the best car movie ever made. Before this, I thought Gone in 60 seconds was the best car movie. Just by the preview I knew this would be better and it was. There are more cars in 60 Seconds but theres more action, better plot and much better acting. If they put Nicholas Cage in this movie he would have ruined it. I mean he wasn't good in 60 seconds at all. Vin Diesel was the man for the job and he got the job done. Im a little disappointed that he won't be back for the sequel. He chose Pitch Black over Fast and the Furious. Pitch Black sucks. XXX is awesome but not as good as this.",emfern13,"Oct 26, 2002"

I liked it most because it had a plot, it wasn't just all about cars, there was a point besides ""my car is better than yours."" It seems that way at first but there are lots of surprises that you would least expect, that was another good part about it as well. Although, the main thing is that the guys were hot, at least some of them. Just kidding:)",Ffyand,"Aug 2, 2001"

Acting was very good on Vin Diesel's and most others parts(especially Jesse), but some of the actors were lacking (Paul Walker, dont try to lower your voice, it doesnt make you look cool).

I think The Fast and the Furious is one of the best movies made in many years. Everything is good about it. There are no boring scenes, and no boring characters!Anyone who enjoys thriller, action, adrenalin packed movies ought to see this movie and enjoy it! The plot was well written and the actors are at their finest. Even if someone is not particularly a Vin Diesel or Paul Walker fan etc., this movie is sure to keep the viewer at the edge of their seat!",CaitMayer,"Aug 5, 2002"
10,Paul walker,"This movie franchise has been around since before I was born. I've seen every movie at least 5 times, and not one has disappointed me. I love the fact that they use a variety of different vehicles from different places around the world. One thing that kinda bothers me is the fact that since Brian(Paul Walker, Rest In Peace) died, the movies seem as if the characters are more or less heroes than street racers. If universal studios could maybe town down on the heroic scenes and more street racing scenes, I would be beyond happy. But other than that, I highly recommend this series to car lovers! Fast and Furious was a very good movie that had a darker and more serious tone than any of the prior films in the franchise. I loved seeing almost the entire original cast return and the amazing cars and impressive special effects that are a staple of the series return once again...",tinasheponde,"Jan 2, 2025"
10,Awesomeness,As a person who loves romantic comedies i was a little sceptical about the movie. Paul walker made the movie exceptional. I really didn't expect that action packed movie to blow my mind. Sometimes it's not right to judge the movie merely because they say it's an action movie. I really really appreciate the production team as it was well executed and it did not feel fake. Action movies have a tendency of being over tbe top but for the first time in history this movie was right on right on.... A definite undeniable ten out of ten for me and I'm usually not generous with my marks on reviews generally.,charmizle,"Jan 2, 2025"
10,ROB COHEN'S A GENIUS!,"this movie is the bomb! it's my all time favorite! i mean, what more can you ask for? great stunts, awesome cast, cool cars, and a great story!
to whoever said the dialogue is bad, it's supposed to be! it's street lingo, not proper english! vin diesel was absolutely awesome. the role of dominic toretto fits him really well. of course, he's sexy too but let's not forget his talent. he is one of the most talented actors in hollywood. paul walker is awesome, he's hot and also talented. michelle rodriguez is the bomb! she just rocks! she's a kick butt chick and the role of letty fits her real well. jordana brewster is also awesome, she plays her part really well.
to whoever said the actors couldn't act, well think again. i rented the DVD and went back to the store to buy it. the bonus materials are great, especially the making of the movie and the music videos. this movie explains the whole street racing world really well and they got great cars!
i also liked johnny strong who played leon and chad lindberg who played jesse. matt schulze (vince) was awesome, too. he played the part really well.i saw this movie practically 10 times and would continue to watch it over and over and over again. i would never get tired of watching it.  i recommend this to anyone. this movie absolutely rocks!i liked this movie 'cause it's not all street racing. there's a bit of drama and some funny situations. there's dominic who explains how his dad died, paul walker who's undercover and falls in love with mia (jordana) and letty whose boyfriend is dominic. i'm telling you if you haven't seen this movie, rush to the video store and buy it--don't rent it.""What do they plan on racing with, hopes and dreams?""

10,Great...,"Great Movie set in the Means Streets of L.A. and also in the desert of Arizona. Many people can relate to Vin's Character Dom as he is like gravity, many things get pulled to him. Also, it becomes apparent in the film that as Brian joins Dom's group, their lives start falling apart... Jesse ends up dying, Vince ends up with a life-threatening injury, Leon and Letty are not seen again, Vin escapes the L.A. scene and nobody really knows whats happens to Mia. Brian was meant to be working for the good of things as a police officer and he feels the guilt of making their lives fall apart and that is the reason why he lets Dom go at the end of the movie. 2 Fast 2 Furious however, does not tie the loose ends up that this movie leaves behind, which is rather disappointing. 8/10",Poita,"Jan 19, 2005"

What started as a modest street-racing film grew into one of the most successful action franchises of all time. This debut installment, however, stands apart for its raw energy, grounded narrative, and the chemistry between its leads, making it a thrilling and enduring experience.The film centers around Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), a charismatic street racer and mechanic, and Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), an undercover cop tasked with infiltrating Toretto's crew to investigate a series of high-speed truck hijackings. As Brian becomes immersed in the world of illegal street racing, he begins to question his loyalties, torn between his duty as a cop and his growing respect for Dom and his tight-knit family.Vin Diesel's portrayal of Dominic Toretto is magnetic.

8,"Hey Dude, where's the story?","FAST, SENSELESS BUT WITH NICE CAR CHASES...THE GOOD While I'm not really a fan of the music score the volume was high enough. The sounds of the engines and autos where nice. The car chases were virtually everything in the movie and they delivered. Jordana Brewster is a nice actress but should have gotten more lines of speech :-)THE BAD I missed the plot or story line or whatever the movie is about. Ok, ok, it's a movie but the logical errors were so big that you could drive through with a 18-wheeler. Ahem, where are all the cool all-american cars?THE UGLY I REALLY MISSED the story line.

10,Masterpiece,"After leaving the Los Angeles police and being captured by Miami police amidst street races, former officer Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) is forced to take part in a new mission: infiltrate Miami's organized crime of investigating the transportation of dirty money to Carter Verone (Cole Hauser), the head of local trafficking. For this, he receives the help of his childhood friend Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson), and secret agent Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes). Despite the movie had two scripts with Vin Diesel and one without him was better anyway! Engaging plot, simply magnificent script and breathtaking racing scene. For this reason my movie grade is 10.0.Movie watched on March 25, 2019",mfellipecampos,"Nov 21, 2019"
8,Very fast and very furious and has a kicking soundtrack,"Film great.  Soundtrack is wicked.  I cant praise this film enough. Excellent stunts and cars to go mad over.  The chase scenes are some of the best i have ever seen and the races will completley blow everyone away, even if you dont like cars watch this film just for the rush and thrill of the ride.",westable,"Sep 3, 2001"
10,It is indeed fast and furious one of the underated movie,"Officer Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) goes undercover in the Los Angeles street racing circuits in order to find out which of the racing crews is committing crimes with their muscle cars. But going undercover is never easy, especially with such affable miscreants.The basic premise is really nothing special. But then again, it doesn't need to be. The point of this movie is in its style. It has fast cars, lots of racing, lots of hot, greased-up babes, muscle-heavy men (and cars) and a killer soundtrack. You don't watch it to be intrigued by carefully orchestrated plot points or tragic backstories or the heaviness of its pathos. No, you watch it to kick back, relax and have a good time.And in delivering that, the movie more than delivers. But if it was just that, I'd probably rate the film a bit lower. What actually elevates this film above its immediate peers and helped launch a huge franchise, is the fact that this film is punching above its weight class and succeeding. And it does that by having some real good actors playing roles they were born to play. Walker is one of them, but I also have to mention Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez.Thumbs up to these great legends they really deserve to be applauded. Even the graphics is 10/10 I am just speechless.",shephymoyez,"Jan 2, 2025"
10,THE FAST AND FURIOUS,"One of the best of all the times, i don't know how many times I've repeatedly watched this movie yet i still cant get enough of it.The production, the hot babes and the street racing was everything.The combination of of the cast is amazing , getting to see the under cover officer Conner falling in love with Dominick's sister was very unexpected but that was the interesting part of the movie scene, enemies getting to share a table because of Dominicks sister. Also Dominic's performance is tremendous, besides fast and furious being a great movie we also get to learn a lot about loyalty and betrayal. I also loved seing my favorite actor Mitchell Rodriguez.",sihlolalinet,"Jan 3, 2025"

10,I absolutely loved the movie. Vin Diesel rocks!! And Michelle Rodriguez is HOT!!,"I absolutely love this movie. The stunts and cars are phenominal. The 1969 Dodger that Vin Diesel's character drives is my favorite. It stars Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Rick Yune, and a small role that Ja Rule perfects. Vin Diesel plays Dominic Toretto, the leader of a group of street racers who also hi-jack 18 wheelers and steal their goods. Paul Walker plays Brian O. Spilner, a undercover cop who must bust Toretto and his team to get a cop badge. He ends up falling for Jordana Brewster's character Mia Toretto who's the sister of Dominic. Michelle Rodriguez plays Letty, a tom boy type street racer, and also Dominic's lover(real life girlfriend). Rick Yune plays Jonny Tran, a street racer and Dominic Toretto's rival. Spilner(Walker) ends up getting too deep with Dominic(Diesel) and becomes his buddy. He and Mia(Brewster) begin a short lived relationship. He reveals himself to her as a cop and convinces her to help him stop Dominic before he gets himself killed trying to make his big bust. Dominic(Diesel) ends up losing one of his friends, nearly losing another one, and nearly losing his. In the end Spilner(Walker) lets Dominic(Diesel) off the hook by giving him a 10 second car he owed him by losing too him in a race.

10,Amazing movie,"Few films can claim to redefine a genre, but Fast & Furious proves why this franchise has become a cultural phenomenon. Directed by Justin Lin, this adrenaline-fueled action epic combines high-octane car chases, explosive stunts, and a surprisingly heartfelt story about loyalty and family.The plot revolves around Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), a skilled street racer with a dangerous past, and Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), an undercover cop torn between duty and newfound brotherhood. Their chemistry drives the story as much as their souped-up cars burn rubber on the streets of Los Angeles.What makes Fast & Furious stand out isn't just the jaw-dropping action sequences-though those are spectacularly choreographed. It's the emotional stakes. Each stunt feels personal, every race is more than a thrill; it's a test of trust, respect, and survival.Lin's direction ensures the film never loses momentum, and the script strikes a balance between grit and humor. Meanwhile, the soundtrack pumps life into every scene, blending hip-hop, rock, and Latin beats that perfectly match the film's fast-paced energy.Yes, it's over the top at times, and the laws of physics take a backseat, but that's part of the fun. Fast & Furious isn't just a movie-it's an experience. Whether you're a gearhead or simply love a good action flick, this film delivers.Buckle up and enjoy the ride. You won't regret it.",nyashadzasheduri,"Jan 2, 2025"

10,A rush? Maybe. A great way to spend an afternoon? Definitely.,"Some people might not enjoy this film, yet I feel that it overall reflects what's going on out there on the streets both today as well as several years back when I used to race the streets of Tacoma, WA. The cars may have changed, but not much else. Street racing has always been and will be, a part of our culture (if not a somewhat darker part) as long as there are automobiles on roads. The acting is ""average"", although Vin Diesel is beginning to make it very plain that he is coming into his own as he gets more work. -Very cool in Pitch Black by the way. I give the action scenes a high score as they do give the viewer an excellent impression of the speed experienced behind the wheel of these cars. Special effects and stunts are ""well toned"" and placed where they need to be. By now you might guess that I really enjoyed this flick. I just hope the DVD is a collector's edition with lots of extras, especially with more racing footage! Kudos to Rob Cohen (your best film to date), Vin, and Paul for a very enjoyable afternoon indeed... Now go enjoy the movie. :)",netdestiny,"Jun 24, 2001"
10,"Just read the review, it's not long.","Some movies are meant to be taken serious (Braveheart, The Shawshank Redemption), some movies are meant to be hilarious (Scary Movie, Airplane), and some are meant to be pure action and fun (Terminator 2, FAST AND THE FURIOUS).  Out of ALL the car movies I have seen, this is BY FAR the best.Other people who have reviewed this movie said it's ""crap"", ""not worth you're money"", ""mindless and illogical"".  But some people just need to lighten up and turn on their ""action movie"" senses when they go to see an action movie like the Fast And The Furious, apparently they have their ""serious movie"" senses on.  This movie has great car scenes, is very true to life, some say it isn't, it is, and is a VERY fun movie to watch.The is DEFINENTELY the most awesome and kick ass movie I have ever seen, it isn't the best, but it IS the most awesome.  It is WELL worth you're money. No movie is perfect though...well...almost no movie, this movie has 2 little flaws.  #1.  All the cars were riceburners, they had 1 Ferrari, they needed more BMW M3's!!!!!  And #2.  The ending kind of leaves you wondering a few questions.  Vin Diesel is as good as he was in Pitch Black, a movie I HIGHLY recommend you see, ESPECIALLY with surround sound and the volume UP.  But I would give The Fast & The Furious a 99 out of 100.

10,It's all about the men and their toys!!! Woo Hoo,The movie the fast and the furious was by far the best movie I have seen this year.  I have seen it twice already and I will continue to see it again while it is in the box office.  Vin Diesel and Paul Walker and Ja Rule (as short as his skit was) played a excellent role in the movie.  This movie gave me and my co-watchers a instant adrenaline rush and after the movie we were all able to spot who had seen the movie just by their driving.  I know that the movie kicked butt but people need to be careful after seeing it because they don't drive safely.  If everyone would just go to see the movie and not try to participate in what it's actions were it would be one of the best movies of all time.  Thanks to Vin Diesel and Paul Walker and Ja Rule!!

This movie is definetly not for older adults, but for teenagers, such as me.  The beginning of the movie is interesting, the middle does drop off a little, except some parts.

10,This movie was great,"I don't know what several of these people are smoking.The movie was great.Cast: Not too shabby, Vin Desil was perfect for the part. i couldn't really picture anyone else there.Storyline:People say its only drag races blah blah. No it's about an undercover cop that is trying to break a truck hijacking ring, but he becomes soft on Vin and his gang, and love gets in the way of his work as well.The race scenes  were cool. The final one was my favorite, :-).And hot girls, oh COME ON... They are in the background, maybe the movie would be alittle better if ya took your eyes off the girls.As for the cheesy one liners, you anwser me this. In reality who comes up with an really cool saying?

10,Clearly one of the best movies of the summer,I just walked out of this movie and I'm still trying to catch my breath. Vin Disel (the next big action star) plays Dom a drag racer/mechaninc who is caught up in a stolen goods ring. Paul Walker(the next Rob Lowe) plays Brian an undercover cop sent to inflriate Dom's gang and try to stop them. The film also a subplot where Dom's gang has beef with an Asain crew lead by Rick Yune. Things complicate when Brian falls for Dom's sister played by the very sexy Jordanna Brewster. The film has a great supporing star in Michelle Rodgurez and cameo by Ja Rule. It also has some of the best car chase scenes since Ronin. Just go and enjoy this film.,DunnDeeDaGreat,"Jun 23, 2001"
10,Quite entertaining,"The subsequent films in the Fast and the Furious series always have more thrill and action than the preceding film. As is customary, the movie's opening sequence bursts onto the screen with the most action and tension. The first-scene action makes it possible for viewers to fixate on the screen the entire time. The film encourages audience participation. The movie is great it has alot of action, a great story and the actors all do a great job. The special effects are also really good. The camaraderie and chemistry among the characters resonate with audiences. High-Octane Action: The franchise is known for its thrilling car chases, elaborate stunts, and action sequences.

8,not bad at all,"This seems to be one of those things where there are two types of people: ones who loved, and ones who hated it. I happen to be one of the ones who loved it, I unlike the reviewer who's review was the first one shown as I right this thought the dialog was written fine, vin diesel is a good actor, and that a large amount of this movie's apeal is in how the car scenes are shot. In alot of movies, when they try to throw cars into the mix, you get bored, the shots are too centered, it gets boring, everytime they race the cars here, the screen shakes and gives me (and anybody else who loved this movie) an awesum rush. All in all, don't believe what ANYBODY tells you about this movie, it's really the sort of thing that you need to see for yourself to know if you love it or hate it. See it for yourself and make YOUR OWN opinion.",personguyman,"Aug 10, 2002"

10,Clearly some of you didn't pay attention to the ads.,"See, here's the problem.  Most people are giving this movie bad reviews and comments because they went into the theater wanting too see character development and a deep, thought-provoking plot.  Since when did the producers and writers say that would be included?  This movie, or any of its type for that matter, was never about a heavy story.  Its about speed and adrenaline.  When I went to see this movie, I wasn't thinking I would leave the theater I marveling at the emotional ending, I expected to leave wanting to peel-out of the parking lot and get home in the fastest time possible, racing down the highway not caring about anything else.  That's what this movie promised and it delivered.  so to all of you who misunderstood the purpose of ""The Fast and the Furious"", I say next time, go watch a Disney movie or something and give me speed and thrills.",blantonstogdill,"Jun 23, 2001"

No rating,worst movie ever,"First of all, I have a Greddy turbocharged, intercooled, 13 second, Honda Civic EX. I AM an import car enthusiast but I will have to say that this is the WORST movie I have seen in a long time. I had a feeling it would be bad so I waited to rent it. I wish that I had waited longer. The acting is incredibly bad. It reminds me of the acting you would see on a daytime soap. It's like fingernails scraping down a chalkboard.I see in other reviews here there are claims that they have the cars down right. Hardly. In one race, one of the cars completely trashes his engine after using a 100 shot of NOS. A few minutes later, he races off in it. It's laughable. In fact, the movie was bad enough to laugh all the way through it except for that scraping fingernail thing in background.

No rating,"CARS! CARS! CARS! oh, and lots of Corona and hair-gel.","First of all, I'd like to say that this movie probably wasn't for me in the first place.  I do not own a Honda or Mitsubishi with really loud decals, a $10,000 stereo system, goofy neon lights underneath, a laptop on the dash, and something like ""HIGH PERFORMANCE"" written across the windshield.  Nor, do I own a pair of phat pants or date girls that look like their strait out of ""Maxim"" magazine. I knew this when I picked up the DVD and wasn't too surprised to see that sort of thing being so deliciously glorified.  Plus, I should also confess, I drive rather conservatively and don't quite grasp the cool racer lingo used throughout the script.  The guys down at ""Jiffy Lube"" were able to let me in on a few terms, plus a real good deal on 10w30.But, with camp appeal aside, I found this movie to not be as exciting as the trailer indicated.  There are a few rather tense action scenes hear and there, but were hard to follow after being drowned out by the overblown score.  I found it totally unnecessary to be forced to endure the putrid sounds of untalented Limp Bizket when O' Conner (Paul Walker) is so much as stepping out of his car.  For a minute or two, I thought I might have been in the latest hip dance club and not my living room working on my second row of Chips Ahoy!  I beleive the producers tried to much to appeal to the 15-25 age group and get the clips heavy rotation on MTV.  (Hey, doesn't Fred Durst work for them now?)  Oh! I'm quite sure the soundtrack is also a hot seller!But I may kid the music,  there's nothing funny about Paul Walker. I'm glad to see I wasn't the only one seeing a clear distinction between this and the Keanu Reeves opus ""Point Break."" Walker seems to be the lesser version of Keanu.  He's not.  Keanu isn't even a lesser version of Keanu! I had a tough time deciding between Reeves and Walker as to whose script sounds the most forced and weak-willed macho.  It was a tough call.  But hey, was Walker in ""Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey?""  I think not!  Of coarse, this film had so many young, beautiful people I lost Paul in a couple of scenes.  So at least he seemed at home.  Now, Vin Diesel seems like a likable guy... although I must warn he is a bit scary.  Some may liken him to a shaved grizzly.Oh, and there's the car thing.  Again, not my forte.  The racing scenes, complete with David Fincher-style CGI, are alot of fun, though. Yet, they seem to be few and far between.  Since there is not much to the plot, the writers threw in a thin romance between Walker's character and Diesel's character's sister.  Plus, there's an Asian gang that fill in as the film's villians... I guess.  The idea of Walker as some sort of ""loose cannon"" cop is a bit laughable, as he is kind of a wuss.  But, at least his boss was very understanding and not the kind that says thing like, ""I need some hard evidence, now!"" like we usually find in action movies.But, if you are a fan of import-car racing (and chugging down warm bottles of Corona) this is a movie for you!  I am afraid that it will influence more youngsters to apply those silly muffler caps and white tail light lenses to the cars their parents bought for them.

There were a few disappointments.  One, most of the racecars were imports (OK, ONE from Germany) except for the badass muscle car Dom was ""afraid of"".  Two, I'm surprised that the truck hijacks went off so easily; truckers are a pretty independent lot, and I doubt the ones I know would have let those li'l black Hondas stay in front of them.  Ever see what happens to a car when steamrolled by a truck?  It ain't pretty.But, the paint jobs, the race scenes, the ladies, and the stunts more than made up for the skinny plot.  Definitely a lot of ""don't try this stuff at home"" stuff too.  (Note to you street racers reading this; including a train as an unnamed third opponent in a drag race is a VERY BAD IDEA).

Of course in this movie they use cars instead of surfboards. I always thought that Keanu Reeves and Patick Swayze were a lot cooler than Paul Walker and Vin Diesel. Paul Walker wasn't a bad actor but Vin Diesel underacted his part so bad that it ruined the movie for me (man did that guy sound like an idiot). Ja Rule's scene was one of the most pathetic piece of movie i have ever seen in my life. He couldn't even see above the steering wheel he was so short (were talking Honda Civics here).

I wish the film makers did more research on the cars, and where the hell does a teenager get 60 or 80 grand to dump into a Honda Civic? And if you had that kind of money, why would you. Vin Deisel talks about his 10 second quarter mile car, but the big drag race at the begining of the film takes them about a minute or more to get up to 140mph. And why the hell did the film makers have to use those corny special efex to make the cars look like they are going fast, I hated that crap. Attaching the cameras to the cars and driving them down a closed street at 80 or 100mph will give a better sence of speed. Just look at Ronin.

Vin Diesel isn't the greatest actor in the world and he's not the worst. I think he did a good job in this movie. His character Dominic was likeable even though I thought he was a little conceited. The racing scenes were awesome and I just loved the sounds the cars made! The scene where Vince was trying to climb up on the big truck and his arm got tangled in the wire made me cringe. The last scene where Dominic wrecks the Charger was cool yet sad to watch. (hee hee). And shouldn't Dom have been a lot more injured than it showed? Because I don't think he was wearing a seatbelt.

No rating,Staggeringly bad,"From the very moment the meaningless title (they're fast, sure, but what exactly are they furious about?) looms on screen, accompanied by the kind of deafening music that tw*ts play when they drive their souped-up nissans at three miles an hour down the Walworth Road in rush hour, you know you're in trouble.  There's this guy, played by the worst actor in history, and he drives this green car and he fancies this girl, but she's the sister of the leader of this gang who hijack trucks full of DVD players, for no particular reason other than - hey - it beats working, and the guy, played by the worst actor in history (did I mention that already?) turns out to be - wait for it - a cop!  Yawn.  So, with a plot and characters and dialogue and acting all of a standard not seen on our screens since, well, the last terminally crap Hollywood drivel-fest, we can at least rely on the action sequences, right? Wrong.  As soon as they start drag-racing and the cgi kicks in, all sensation of speed is eradicated, and you are left with a hollow, empty feeling.  Car races/chases are exciting, aren't they?  Well, they used to be, but they aren't any longer.  Badly-edited computer-generated bullsh*t is not my idea of fun.  Is it yours?  And when the chases are done in the old-fashioned way (i.e. in broad daylight, so bad special effects have to be ditched in favour of actual film-making) you find yourself so bored by the characters' predicaments that no amount of pounding music and rapid editing can jolt you out of your stupour. Admittedly, the bald guy has a certain charisma, and can obviously act, but his presence only shows up the other fools in this film for the talentless space-fillers that they are.  Who wrote this?

Plus,if anyone ever saw the movie Point Break, they would obviously notice quite a few similarities. The whole rookie cop going undercover thing, with the adrenline junkies who like to surf, however in this case they like to drive. In Point Break he first suspects those drug dealers, and then knows that it is his friends who are the real criminals, letting Patrick Swayze ""go"" at the end. The difference is this though, in Point Break, they managed to handle the plot a little bit better.

This would have been a lot better if it did not take the whole racing aspect too seriously, and if they had a much better script.  The car culture in this film live in a Zen like state that expresses freedom but with all the overacting done in this movie, you don't quite get that. Vin Deasel and Paul Walker do good work but the chemistry is not there, and the script can't get over the seriousness long enough to even care about what happens to ether of them.

And just between us, he's not very well cast as the stoic bad guy.  There's more depth there than that, and this film, and his previous films, have yet to mine it.  I think he has the potential to fill the void left by the aging of such heavyweights as Sylvester Stalone and Bruce Willis, neither of whom, you may remember, were exactly Laurence Olivier in the beginning, but who became fine actors with time.

No rating,"Ok man, but I don't think I'll need the seatbelt...","""The Fast And The Furious"" came up to Spanish theaters on October 5th. Next day I saw it. And... what can I tell? It gave me a light sour taste... This is the type of movie with a completely disorganized plot and script (Note: the script is not such, it's a strange melange made up of sequences in which cars are the real stars) in which the sucession of events is so fast and bad sequenced it ends up giving you the general idea of a bad movie. The script shows very typical clichés of the genre. Although there are two or three points I liked, like uncovering the main character's real job from the start, these show no originality, as they have also been used in other movies. But... what can I ask for in a mega commercial movie, specially aimed at youngsters and teenagers demanding an incredibly simple and void story with nice boys and girls, tuned cars and tremendous doses of adrenaline? Nothing, that's the answer. This is one of those typical films, perfect to spend with your friends a friday afternoon or wait for it to appear at the video rentals and watch it at home with your boy/girlfriend, your dog or just some pop corn.Rob Cohen is a competent director whose main characteristic is that he can deal with almost any kind of genre. Let's remember he has experimented with fantasy (""Dragonheart""), drama (TV series ""thirtysomething"", ""The Skulls"") and action (""Daylight""). He certainly knows about this. ""The Fast And The Furious"" can be considered a revitalisation to his filmography, a gate to a new sector of viewers. And I have to say that he does almost fine, as he gives just what these viewers ask for! And he certainly had resources to achieve this.Certainly, the best of these resources, and I admit I loved it, was the infinite exposition of tuned cars and the introduction into the world of tuning. Oh man, those are the kind of machines almost all of us car lovers would like to drive, despite the bit of fantasy some of them are gien (the 900 Horsepower monster or the easy it appears to be manipulating nitrous oxide, when certainly it isn't, if you passed your chemistry at school...). The cars, the chases, the races and the scenes in which they are the stars are interesting, enjoyable and quite exciting. From my point of view, they surpass those of ""Gone In 60 Seconds"", which was claimed to be the end of Millenium absolute car movie (what a lie...), and ended up in another exposition, more calm and simple, of luxury cars. And that's another point, because those shown in ""TFATF"" are pure fan design, autos we certainly don't see so commonly as we can see a Porsche Boxster or even a Hum-vee (also, I enjoyed more the Hum-vee scene in ""The Rock"", than that of""Gone In 60 Seconds"").About the acting, I can't tell much. I only knew Paul Walker from ""Varsity Blues"" and Jordana Brewster (beautiful, I have to say!) from ""The Faculty"". Nothing about the rest. I already told the cars are the main stars, actors are the supporting cast.About the music, that seemed interesting, I must say. Some nice techno and drum n'bass songs can be heard throughout the film. The good about it is that, at least, it gives rhythm to a practically sank show.I think that's about all. You've seen my recommendations, it's just a movie to see, have some good time and then forget. If you need a seatbelt for this, you may grab one, but just for 15 or 20 minutes.  And a little fact: even in the translation of the Spanish title you find a total different thing, but that still corresponds to the rhythm of the film: ""A Todo Gas"" (Full Throttle)...

That was my first indicator; the bad movies always sell out first.  (Duh!)  But I finally got to see it anyways.The dialogue of the movie was awful.  It was absent of polyslavic words and its underuse of swearing and 5 dollars words made it unreal.  Everyone knows that people who fix cars are idiots, but do they really have to stereotype them so?  Also, their sentences and word order made sense instead of trying to rearrange words arbitrarily like some kind of altavista language translator.  Hell, they should have made me the screenwriter so that I could write the script for a subculture I know nothing about.  If you want real life dialogue, then go to a barbershop.  I mean, you can usually get a good haircut for less than 8.25 and it would be just as entertaining.The plot of the movie was bad, I mean sucked, yeah, sucked.  This was about a bunch of cars going fast.  I was expecting something more along the lines of Sense and Sensibility, but all I got was action instead.  The characters were awful, exhibiting a range of emotions and dynamics.  If you want to see fast cars, you should watch NASCAR.  That is, unless you wanna see something besides an ovular race track populated by rednecks and West Virginians (my apologies to the cross-eyed, brilliant people of West Virginia). If you wanna see a GOOD movie about forms of transit, rent Thomas the Tank Engine.Who hired these actors?  Between their enjoyable roles and physical attractiveness, they were awful.  Especially Vin Diesel.  You could defenitely tell he was a complete wuss by the way he beat the living hell out of Johnny Tran.  Give me five minutes in a phone booth with that alien killing maniac and only ONE will emerge baby.  I guess when you make an independant film on a limited budget, you can't afford to pay Julia Roberts and Richard Gere 20 million each to play a hooker and closet homosexual every time.I gave this movie a -1 out of 1 to 10 because its intensity and entertainment value were not worth me taking the night off at Starfucks. If I wanted to see real intensity, I should have stayed home and watched the new episode of Antique Road Show.  Fast cars are overrated as well as attractive actors/actresses.

That was with cars, sure the film is basically based upon Cars, Violence & Women, the film still manages to get your adrenalin puping in your system whether you are a cars fan or not.Yet Fast & The Furious in depth is deeply flawed, when you look at all of it's attributes the movie can become unpleasant because there is basically a lack of plot. Every film starts off with a plot, yet one can even tell they had a problem even working on a PLOT SUMMARY of the film, because there really isn't much more to talk about other than cars. I suppose the plot summary should have been ""POINT BREAK: ON THE ROAD"". The movie bascially copies Point Break (Keanu Reeves) and just places all the action and adrenalin on the road.The cars in the film are fantastic to look at, and the cinematography is simply magical. When you look at the acting, it is on a half-half par, the scenes with Vin Diesel & Paul Walker just weren't dramatic enough, even though the two do seem to do a good job at other times. Sure the car has fantastic cars, sexy women & a great adrenelin rush, it simply cant go passed the BORDERLINE/GOOD barrier in my ratings barrier, although a stronger plot really would have placed this in the rankings of excellence.ACTING: Acting was mediocore in total, nothing overwhelming by any of the cast, yet most of the cast do a good enough job playing their characters.Vin Deisel & Paul Walker should have intensified their scenes.ACTORS: The variety of actors in the film are good, though there were thousands of extra's in the film too, thats to be appreciated. Vin Deisel is still going strong with his career so is Paul Walker, the female leads were a good choice for their teasing roles.SCRIPT: Poor, i don't find how one can simply write a film based on cars, the plot line was very thin and quiet silly. The script wasn't well written, the cinematography did it all for the film, the script basically wasn't needed, dialogue wasn't good at all. Not a good attempt.CINEMA: The cinematography in Fast & The Furious was quiet amazing, during many of the scenes you wander ""How did they do that?"" . The camera work is fantasic, the locations although not pretty, do set the atmosphere for the film, a great job that should be applauded.ACTION: I don't really know what genre this film would be calssified as, it had abit of everything in it, that doesn't mean it passed each category. The action wasn't really intense, the comedy was low, the drama was low, it wasn't very thrilling either, yet a few scenes did leave your blood pumping for more.MUSIC/SOUND: The soundtrack to Fast & Furious is great, i loved the trancey beats used during the drag scenes, excellent. The sound on the other hand was truely screeching to the ears, the cars didn't sound nice despite their looks, a good enough job though.OVERALL: Fast & The Furious is a good movie, again only in a few terms, every other term is flawed, the script is thin and lame whie the Cinematography is beautiful. The acting is good, while it was low on action. I guess this movie is for hardcore car fans, although i would think they wouldn't even realise a plot is missing, i love cars...i love girls...i love things that are Fast & Furious, but i don't love this movie as much as others do, come on people, look passed the cars and the girls, there really is no story! Hence nothing to ride home about, even though it had great potential.*** (3 STARS) out of 5.",Stealth-5,"Mar 7, 2002"

I loved the cars, (especially the '71 dodge charger) and the effects (showing the interior of the manifolds, the valves, etc when NOS is used to increase speed) but the only two people who acted pretty well were Vin Diesel and Ted Levine. The locations were great to shoot a car race on due to the hills in California. It's good to see that the female mechanic and racer were depicted in this movie, although they could have come from another form than Michelle Rodriguez, who probably doesnt know what a spark plug is let alone a transmission, motor, engine, radiator, suspension, shocks, etc. just due to her looks. It's a good movie if you can get yourself over the embarrassment of how bad the acting is.

The dialogue was laughably rediculous (""....before I leave treadmarks on your face.""), and so was the acting. Michael Schultz (sp) needs some serious acting classes.

'Furious' takes you someplace not far from reality. I will admit - I pass by 18-wheelers now and determine which ones I could drive under. I look at these lil punks in Hondas, Acuras and Mazdas, loud pipes, chromed out rims and tons of spray and ask myself 'Where tha party at?'

No rating,"Little Substance, Lots of Bang","The Fast and the Furious is too much glitz and not enough plot. Paul Walker cannot act at all. While fans may think Vin Diesel is cool, that is not enough to carry this film. The only appealing part of this movie was the action sequences, in which they were very well done. It had some nice plot twists, but it seemed as if the director didn't care at all about the plot, he just wanted to blow things up. This definitely qualifies as a teen movie.

For Walker, this is the perfect assignment because he gets to race and drive fast cars with newfound friend Vin Diesel within working hours. 'The Fast and the Furious' sets out to make a movie with ultra-cool street races and the like; not create an in-depth story with character developments for the more enlightened viewer.

Not considering the 'car' scenes, this film was really awful. Add in the car scenes, and it was still awful. The cars were ludicrous Japanese painted whores of cars (primarily a Japanese market for this film, I guess), and the action wasn't filmed particularly well: there was nary a sense of speed anywhere.To the acting, plot, and dialogue. Perhaps Vin Diesel skipped some acting classes to go to the gym.

No rating,"B-Movie Mania, baby!","Teen angst and illegal street racing.  Not exactly a match made in heaven, but here it works, due to amazing car stunts, and some interesting ideas.  A group of thieves in robbing trucks after catching them in suped-up race-ready street model cars, and an undercover cop is on the case to try to find the crooks before they end up dead.  The emphasis of the movie however is racing scenes and amazing car stunts, of which there are quite a few. These are some nice sequences, and ultimately save what would otherwise be a piece of crap and make you believe the movie wasn't that bad.  Performances are all right; none of these guys are going after the Oscar, but overall, its not that bad.  Especially enjoyable was the absolutely luscious Jordana Brewster(""The Faculty"") as the obligatory love interest.

No rating,"A porn, except this one's about cars.","This movie is for all the young punks in their late teens/early twenties who spend all their hard-earned money from Structure or Banana Republic on air intakes and turbo chargers for their Honda Civics. It's an action flick glorifying the lives of these young punks who drive their souped up pieces of s***.  Except for one thing though....the folks driving the cars in this movie were older, and richer.  But just as lame. It came as no surprise to me that I was probably the oldest person in the theater when I watched this.  And I am 26 years old!This film has the architecture of a porn.  The spine of the movie is the action, but there always seems to be a token plot.  Ok, so this undercover police officer is trying to bust these car-racing hoodlums, and falls in love with the sister of the leader.  The writers seemed to put something into that aspect of the story.  So what happens to the couple at the end? Nobody knows.  And why should we?  It had nothing to do with the fast driving.  The writers tried to develop a character for Vin Diesel, but they forgot one thing: a story that actually needs a developed character!  The ""emotional"" scenes were thrown in randomly, as were the personality traits of the characters.  Presumably, just so that they could say that ""The Fast and the Furious"" is really a ""movie"".  Doesn't that sound like a porn to you?Honestly though?  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.  It's just plain mindless entertainment.

No rating,"A must for anyone who likes cars, but thats about it","I want to start by saying that this film has some beautiful cars in it that were the result of hundreds of hours of hard work.  Rob Cohen does them justice with his slick camera work and effects to really bring the cars to life.However, the film lacks two ingredients to make it a truly great film. Number one, a plausible plot that flows logically.  The basic setting of an underground street racing circuit is an excellent place to start, but to simply use a plot that was dangerously similar to Point Break was disappointing.  I found the film was way too easy to predict the ending and unlike Point Break they didn't resolve the outcomes for the majority of the ensemble characters.  I thought the film needed to be about 15 to 20 minutes longer so that adequate time could be given to fill out certain parts of the film that seemed to jump from a to b without much substance, i.e. the formation of Brian's relationship to the Toretto siblings.Two, Vin Diesel does the most with a script that struggled to portray all the multiple facets that his characterization of Dominic Toretto possessed, but Paul Walker simply doesn't have the talent as a leading man to carry the film.  I thought Jordana Brewster was good and I would have liked to have seen more of Michelle Rodriguez's character as I really enjoyed her outing in Girlfight, but to no avail.While I have no doubt that the actors are more than capable of doing a lot better than the script allows, we were not allowed to see it.I really hope that if they make a sequel, they do it properly.",Jammer-12,"Oct 9, 2001"
No rating,Anyone with a brain stem need not apply.,"""The Fast and the Furious"" slams into overdrive from the get go and it doesn't stop until the very end, but well that's not a good thing this time around. Unlike, some recent mindless action movies, like ""Swordfish"" and even the horrid ""The Mummy Returns,"" ""Furious"" doesn't seem to care if the audience knows what's going on, on screen, it just wants to cram as many nice cars and nice looking girls as it can, so the viewer will be distracted enough that they won't realize that this is just a bad, bad movie. The plot has something to do with expensive electronic equipment getting stolen from 18 wheelers, by members of a gang who drive really fast cars. As for the cast, well there isn't much help from them either. Paul Walker sounds like Keanu Reeves, but doesn't have the on screen toughness necessary to play his role right and Vin Diesel sounds almost too much like Sylvester Stallone that it's scary, but at least he seems comfortable in his role. Well to sum up this isn't a very good movie, but judging by it's intake at the box office, ($100+ mil. in 3 weeks) the bad reviews just won't stop this film from becoming a smash hit.

No rating,"It is fast, but it ain't furious...","Director Rob Cohen has made a living out of making consistently mediocre films. From his earliest attention getting feature films such as 'Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story' to the equally unimpressionable 'Dragonheart', he has never earned my respect as bringing something new to the film industry. In his latest feature film 'The Fast and The Furious', he makes it seem as if he is bringing something new, when in reality he is not. He is simply taking a new theme in film rarely explored and cutting this film into a 106-minute music video. Filled with some sloppy editing and horrendous clichéd lines, this film explores the underground world of street racing. While Cohen enjoys displaying his modified cars in many tracking shots along the sunny beaches of California, there are many elements that can be deemed detrimental to the final product.  Despite the film's horrible 'teeny-bopper' title, this film does retain one astounding element that has crept under the radar. That one element delivers this film on all levels it could not perform, that one element is Vin Diesel. Mark Vincent, otherwise known as Vin Diesel has been in many films yet never has he carried a film as he does here. From his stint as Private Adrian Carpazo in 'Saving Private Ryan' to his juicy role as Chris Varick in 'Boiler Room', this one film will solidify him as one of the fastest stars to climb the ladder of success in Hollywood. Now we understand why the Great Spielberg cast him in a small yet important role in his film, and we now know why this film isn't as bad as it could have been. This film's inexcusable plot to set up a racing sequence after another centers itself upon an undercover cop attempting to infiltrate an underground street racing circuit in an attempt to unravel a hijacking ring. Paul Walker plays Brian O'Connor, the newest member of the team joining Turetto's gang who seemingly has an agenda of his own. While Walker seems to be doing his best attempt at conveying a brute man with a deep voice, Cohen seems to enjoy shooting Walker for his blue eyes and blonde hair appeal. Contrasting these two main characters who forge a deep bond in the film, Diesel is shot in all his raw appeal as he gets himself dirty and displays his charisma at being a leading man, whether in a villainous role or not.Cohen sets up the film quickly and stresses the fact that the film will be laced with fast cars, furious sequences and racing that attempts to leave viewers dizzy, yet only leaves the educated viewer questioning the logistics of such sequences. Where Cohen does get my respect is whereas in his previous films such as Stallone's horrible 'Daylight', he veers away from his conventional formula that did not work and lets the character study not tell the story, and lets the car-obsessed viewer gets their rocks off with the hundreds of modified cars that race up and down the street.His aim was never to win an Academy Award; his aim was to deliver an intense racing film that perhaps wanted to rival Frankenheimer's 'Grand Prix' or that of 'Ronin'. Unfortunately, he has failed. He keeps the film going quickly enough in order to make the viewer forget about the past scene and brings us into a new sequence completely unrelated from the former. Taking into account the modified Japanese cars and coupling them with some interesting race sequences, he delivers a mildly formulaic yet pleasing film that will be enjoyed mostly at home as a rental. This film is not a work of art, nor a groundbreaking film. But what Cohen attempts to do is deliver a fast film in which the filmmakers could not think of a better title. The film is filled with imperfections and the casting of some characters may somewhat be questionable as well. Furthermore, Cohen's direction seems to be lifting off various music videos in order to combine the furious editing with the fast music of composer BT. Perhaps one of the film's other flaws is the attempt to edit a piece of music into every scene in the film in hopes of making a scene bigger than it really is. Except for the final hijacking scene, music is rampant within the film and film studies students will see how a piece of music can either make or break a film. In this case, it does neither. That is how ineffective it is. I must admit that I wasn't bored while viewing the film, yet I wasn't devastatingly impressed either. Cohen knows exactly what he has with Diesel and makes good use of him, as for the other failing elements, Cohen resorts to some tacky CGI in order to spice up the racing scenes and simply bogs down this film with his attempt at really wanting to impress - yet he does not. He has delivered a film that will appeal and satisfy the many car lovers out there with the unrealistic racing sequences and those who get a rush out of bad editing. Finally, what is conceivable about this film is Cohen's attempt at wanting to impress us so hard with his music, his editing and his CGI that he forgets to include a bit of substance. Witness the final scene for substance and one will know that the actual conveying of emotion did play a part in the film, albeit too late.Giancarlo's Rating: **    (out of 4)",giancarlorocks,"Jan 13, 2002"
No rating,My Opinion,"After seeing this film my initial reaction was one of disappointment.  Vin Diesel did another great job as he did in Boiler Room, but the lead Paul Walker reminded me way too much of Steve from the show full house and the voice of Aladdin in the Disney flick and it irritated me throughout the film.  The car chase scenes and detail put into making the cars as visually impressive as possible was well carried out but the viewer was left with a gaping hole where a meaningful plot should be. The plot summary read ""Undercover cops infiltrate Manhattan street racers to bust a hijacking ring"" but this aspect was left in the dust and replaced by Vin's muscles and fast cars.  I enjoyed this movie, and after leaving the theater definitely tried to drive in a more exciting manner but I would not call this movie a great or classic of our times.

No rating,Plodding and silly action thriller.,"2.5 out of 10In The Fast and the Furious, Paul Walker stars as an undercover cop who's seduced by the underground world of drag racing.  Vin Diesel is the head of one particular racing gang that enjoys stealing DVD players off trucks, preferring to do so while the truck is moving at high speeds, perhap for the sheer thrill of it (and spending countless money on NOS, no less).  That's just one of the movie's many idiocies, which would be forgivable if the movie was consistently entertaining.  It's not.Instead of high-octance action, we get too much focus on a plot that's sleep-inducing and actors who look more comfortable posing for a magazine than enunciating dialogue.  Only Vin Diesel makes an impression, though he's certainly not aided by the giggle-inducing dialogue (""You break her heart, I break your neck"").  As for the story, it can be summed up as Point Break with fast cars and the idiots who drive them.  Lead Paul Walker is thoroughly unconvincing as the undercover cop and he shares zero chemistry with Jordana Brewster, the girl whose only purpose in the film is to make him lose his edge.  There are a couple of chase scenes near the end that are reasonably fun, but it's too little too late by then.  For truly thrilling, mindlessly enjoyable car chase mayhem, watch The Transporter instead.",Li-1,"Dec 12, 2002"
No rating,AKA Point Break 2,"I've been wanting to tear into this movie for quite some time. I just haven't been thinking about it because it was such a horrible movie. How this movie ""catapulted"" stars Vin ""Every Race"" Diesel and Paul ""Keanu"" Walker to the A-list boggles the mind. One, if you're making a movie about import cars, 20 to 1 people are going for the cars because they can relate. Two, if you're making an 'action' movie about import cars, you'll at least a decent story to build around it. Three, if you're making a movie about import cars, please please please do not add a rap artist with no acting talent make a 'cameo' AND make the soundtrack to the movie.
Well, ""F&F"" violates those three sacred Ebertclone rules of making a good Import Car movie. One, the movie WAS about the cars but hack/aging hipster/ director???Rob Cohen (Dragon, The Skulls) wanted to exploit the rising star who is known as Vin Diesel (aka Mark Vincent, whether he likes it or not). Hey, let's just make him the anti-hero, the one we're not sure we should root for! Two, instead of thinking of a story (we have that thing called a brain), let's just rent ""Point Break"" (coincidentally a Keanu/Patrick Swayze movie) and replace the surfing boards with import cars! And hey, let's make the bad guys Asian, because they haven't been the bad guys in the past 30 years of filmmaking! Three, let's get that midget no-talent Ja Rule to make a cameo in our movie because at the time he was at the top of the charts! Let's give him the dumbest lines uttered in movie history too! And give him the right to produce a horrible soundtrack too.Nobody stands out in this movie. Not Michelle ""Testosterone Pumped"" Rodriguez, Matt ""I'm A Bad Ass"" Schulz, and not even the stunning Jordana Brewster.  Okay, maybe if she got naked, I would actually like this movie a tad, but unfortunately she doesn't so this movie fails on all 'gears'. This movie even bites off ""Point Break's"" ending, showing no faith in the characters that they 'sketched'. The dialogue is atrocious, the action is implausible, and borderlines on parody ala ""Commando.""  In fact, I believe ""Commando"" to be a way better film than this crap. The funny thing about this movie is that everything is taken seriously. Right down to the last line: ""I owe you a ten second car."" No, like we didn't see that coming. Stay far away.

No rating,Delivers the Unexpected,"I didn't expect too much from this film.  I respect the presence Vin Diesel generates (most notably in Pitch Black, the only other film I'd seen him in besides Saving Private Ryan).  The previews of this film made me believe it was another dumb, illogical car chase movie.  I've always had a spot in my heart for the heat of street racing, having a 67 Camaro as my first car and muscling it whenever I could.  It looked like another dumb, overproduced action film.I was wrong.While Diesel and Walker definitely jelled nicely and played off each other very well, credit to this must go to Rob Cohen and his team of photographers and soundmen.  What's impressive is the feeling of speed this flick generates, and I saw it on HBO.  I regret not seeing it on the screen with a major digital sound system.The plot is so-so and rather predictable, but the real stars are the cars and the races, as well as an adrenaline pumping chase sequence during an attempted hijacking of a big rig.  This has the best driving sequences since The Road Warrior.  The attention to detail, from the design of the cars to the chirping of car alarms as drivers scatter from a police raid is inspired and humorous.If you were skeptical of this film, give it a chance.  It's not The Hours and doesn't aspire to be.  It's 90 minutes of well paced entertainment I couldn't shut off when it started.Rob Cohen is one of our most talented action directors.

No rating,Runs out of agas from the starting block,"Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) has a thing for Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster), who serves up tuna salad sandwiches at a vacant and failing open diner that only seedy, big burly thugs like her car mechanic brother Dominic (Vin Diesel) and his crew Vince (Matt Schulze), Leon (Johnny Strong), Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and Jesse (Chad Lindberg) eat there. Dominic doesn't like the attention Mia is getting from Brian because he buys auto parts under the counter from Brian's boss. The parts are used to illegally enhance cars for street racing.  Dominic and his crew bet on the races to support themselves. On the flip side of the racing coin is a Chinese gang led by Johnny Tran (Rick Yune). Unknown to the general populace, Brian is really a cop investigating a series of truck hijackings that he is trying to link to the street racers.Working at a movie theater, I didn't expect this movie to do the business it did. But when the movie sold out every show on Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, I had to see what all the hooplah was about so I dragged myself into the theatre. Before I went in, I read the synopsis the movie studios send us and said `Hmm, this may be good'. Guys, this movie comes nowhere close to that description. It starts with one of many implied truck hijackings. From there you are swept into what is suppose to be the story.  Quite a few things bothered me about this movie. First, there is an air of fear associated with these street race gangs. They are buff and stuff and claim territory, but what I wanna know is what is so scary about a gang that race cars?  Do theydo drive by honkings or something? What is this movie about? Is it about the illegally enhanced cars and the crime of street racing or is it about the truck hijacking sting. The script really never settles on one or the other. The love story between Brian and Mia goes no where at all. I found myself asking whether if they were together or not.  There is one scene where I think the writer said ` Ooops, wait a minute, I forgot I was supposed to have a strong plot and make a point. I guess I had better clear some things up and make this one story.'  He does this ( or should I say he didn't do this) in a diner scene between Dominic and Brian.  The next thing that bothered me was the fact that even in the police scenes, you never know why the police suspect Dominic of the crimes. The movie gives you the impression that there are tons of street racing gangs and gangs of all types, so why did they focus on Dominic's gang. They try to hang the fact that he had been in fights as the reason but that is very weakAs for the acting, no one should call there mothers or anything because no one stood out. I will give Vin Diesel credit on one scene where in he reminisces on his father's racing days. He was cool and somber in this scene and it worked, but when he starts yelling, he isn't believable at all. His spontaneous rants are more like King Kong beating his chest rather than theatrical emoting. Other than the words, `I am a cop,' Paul Walker never proved he was a cop. Jordana was weak altogether.I will give the camera guys credit for the racing scenes.Ultimately it all depends on what you wish to see in the movie. If you want to see a lot of cool cars and hear Limp Bizkit's `My Way' blared loudly, then sure go see it, if you want cars and a plot, catch an episode of Knight Rider.",spiritualone,"Jun 26, 2001"

And basically I was surprised this movie is considered a racing movie.Racing in a straight line is not exciting, I wish people in the movie business would realize this. But that's not the only thing wrong with this movie. Let's forget for a moment that the plot is really thin, the dialogue horrible, and there's no acting to speak of. The racing is just plain unrealistic. A car speeding by at over 100 miles/hour, spinning out of control and stopping within 20 yards is just not possible. And you can't possibly survive a collision at over 100 mph when you're not wearing at least seatbelts and preferably a helmet. And if you would, you would never be able to get up, get into another car and speed away. There's a lot of action in the movie, but it's never involving.

Vin Diesel burned up the screen as always, and Paul Walker's blue eyes made me melt.  Michelle Rodriguez' and Jordana Brewster's parts could have been plumped up, and the acting was hardly Shakespearean, but it didn't have to be.  Yes, this film is very similar to Keanu Reeves/Patrick Swayze's Point Break, so if you enjoyed that film, you should enjoy this one as well.  In short, it's not a bad way to spend a Saturday afternoon.  As for the racing, I was really impressed with the technology and creativity that goes into the cars, and I think that it's too bad that these racers have so few places where they can show off their cars safely, away from ordinary drivers.  I think every town should have a designated area (perhaps outside the city limits) for this sort of thing.",Charmayne7-1,"Jun 25, 2001"
No rating,Dumb but not boring,"All I can say is I'm glad I wasn't in the parking lot of a cinema after THIS movie let out. Lots of fast driving and dumb dialogue, but the movie does some neat things with scale, the photography's good, and the actors do better than you'd expect with the kind of script this is -- ESPECIALLY Michelle Rodrigues, who is Badness on a Stick. Once Vin Diesel took the New Guy under his wing, I figured this was gonna be POINT BREAK with cars instead of surfboards, but the story tosses in one or two minor plot-twists that sorta keep you guessing.

No rating,"Tripe, somewhat entertaining tripe.","Ok I avoided this movie like the plague. The trailer made it look like nothing but stupid stunts, and sex...all while Limp Bizkit played. They made it look like a movie about car freaks, and who the heck wants to see a movie about idiots who spend thousands on something as stupid as a car?Well I gave in and rented it (after a recommendation from a friend), once you get past the first 15-25 minutes of pure hollywood crap, you basically have a B-movie plot with A-movie stunts.The first 15-25 min. (I didn't keep track) are pure torture. They start off with the illegal street racing scene, which is something out of the 1960's. The latinos are all in one group, the Asians are all in one group, and the blacks all hung out in one group. Apparently their love of cars brings them together, but not enough to intermix socially. And of course all of the guys in the movie look like they have been working out in the gym daily since they were five years old, and all the women look like they just got off their Playboy and Maxim photo shoots.
Then of course to bring in more kids, we have to watch Ja Rule, a very annoying rapper, who should not act, or rap for that matter, get swooned over and offered a threeway. Apparently all Playboy and Maxim models are crazy for guys who will spend thousands on car parts and win at illegal street racing. And then of course it turns out that the Asians in the movie are a gang of low life thugs, another bad movie cliche.And of course there is Vin Diesel's gang, which follow all the typical gang stereotypes. Vin is the cool leader, who all in the illegal car world look up to, and everybody respects and listens to. Then there is Letty (Rodriguez) who is his tough girlfriend, who is presumed frail and then kicks all male butt she comes in contact with. Then Vince (Schulze) his hot-headed right hand man, whose temper has to constantly be kept under control. Then Leon (Strong) who has no role in the gang what-so-ever, yet they make him seem important. And finally Jesse (Lindberg) who is the smartest out of all of them and has the usual ""smart guy, frail body"" physique, and is the youngest one.Eventually the story is about Brian (Walker) being an undercover cop and hunting down the robbers of trucks full of electronic equipment. The dialouge and acting is cheesy, but for those who can stomach b-movie fodder, it's no big deal.Basically the big payoff is the last 20 minutes, which feature amazing car chase scenes, and very cool stunts. My jaw was on the floor through some of those scenes, because you could tell that none of that was faked, no CG, just stunt drivers (maybe, I don't know if the actors did all their own stunts) and well choreographed stunts.Basically I recommend you rent it, laugh at the cliches and bad dialouge and acting, and then let your jaw drop when you get to the final scenes.",TheBabblingFool,"Aug 11, 2002"

Not that unparralelled realism is expected in car movies (after all, it's not like the Gone in 60 Seconds remake was filmed with REAL GT500s), but most of the cars in the movie were not ""hooked-up""... although some of them were (Vin Diesel's love interest's red 240SX is quite famous in the import community and sports an SR20DET; the Supra has a very impressive build sheet and has been featured on ebay several times, etc...)The movie's not only fake in terms of the cars featured, but its' portrayal of street racing and the sport compact car culture is SO far off as well. 180 mph down city streets!?  Setups which DON'T exist?  (The SR20/Civic swap has been completed ONCE in real life; T4s in DSMs are unheard-of, and the ""naussss"" references.)  The show's portrayal of asian-americans and the absurdity of many of the races setups and scenes (Jetta vs. S2000 with ""$100k under the hood""... riiiiight...) were particularily awful.Notice I haven't even mentioned the (totally absurd and unrealistic) plot yet?Now, I'm a big fan of imports, and I even like cheezy, special-effect-substitute-for-budget movies most of the time.

No rating,AKA Point Break 2,"I've been wanting to tear into this movie for quite some time. I just haven't been thinking about it because it was such a horrible movie. How this movie ""catapulted"" stars Vin ""Every Race"" Diesel and Paul ""Keanu"" Walker to the A-list boggles the mind. One, if you're making a movie about import cars, 20 to 1 people are going for the cars because they can relate. Two, if you're making an 'action' movie about import cars, you'll at least need a decent story to build around it. Three, if you're making a movie about import cars, please please please do not add a rap artist with no acting talent to make a 'cameo' AND make the soundtrack to the movie.
Well, ""F&F"" violates those three sacred Ebertclone rules of making a good Import Car movie. One, the movie WAS about the cars but hack/aging hipster/ director???Rob Cohen (Dragon, The Skulls) wanted to exploit the rising star who is known as Vin Diesel (aka Mark Vincent, whether he likes it or not). Hey, let's just make him the anti-hero, the one we're not sure we should root for! Two, instead of thinking of a story (we have that thing called a brain), let's just rent ""Point Break"" (coincidentally a Keanu/Patrick Swayze movie) and replace the surfing boards with import cars! And hey, let's make the bad guys Asian, because they haven't been the bad guys in the past 30 years of filmmaking! Three, let's get that midget no-talent Ja Rule to make a cameo in our movie because at the time he was at the top of the charts! Let's give him the dumbest lines uttered in movie history too! And give him the right to produce a horrible soundtrack.Nobody stands out in this movie. Not Michelle ""Testosterone Pumped"" Rodriguez, Matt ""I'm A Bad Ass"" Schulz, and not even the stunning Jordana Brewster.  Okay, maybe if she got naked, I would actually like this movie a tad, but unfortunately she doesn't so this movie fails on all 'gears'. This movie even bites off ""Point Break's"" ending, showing no faith in the characters that they 'sketched'. The dialogue is atrocious, the action is implausible, and borderlines on parody ala ""Commando.""  In fact, I believe ""Commando"" to be a way better film than this crap. The funny thing about this movie is that everything is taken seriously. Right down to the last line: ""I owe you a ten second car."" No, like we didn't see that coming. Stay far away. And a note to Ja Rule: Nobody lined up on a Friday night and paid $9 to see YOU.",rogerebertsclone,"Mar 22, 2003"

No rating,"An adrenaline rush for the teens, at least.","It's cool that they named this movie after one of the early episodes of the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote (The Fast and The Furry-ous). I'm also amazed that it's a PG-13 (read: movie made for maximum box office appeal) that's pretty good. This review is for the Collector's Edition DVD.Starring rising stars Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordanna Brewster, and Michelle Rodriguez (a true Hispanic hottie) and directed by Rob Cohen, the film takes us on quite a ride through the illegal sport of street racing, where combatants in souped-up import cars race at high speeds for money and the cars themselves. This interesting look at a dangerous aspect of driving is padded by a story of an undercover cop looking for criminals who steal high-priced electronics from truckers.The movie has a great hip image. Whether it's the hipster clothing, the soundtrack, the men and women, or the cars, I think lots of teenage boys and girls should fall in love with this flick. As a 31 year-old, I wasn't as impressed but I still liked this film. The acting is very good and the dialogue is a lot better than most PG-13 films. Of course, you'll feel like you've been for a ""Hell of a ride"" in these amazing cars. You wish you could own one for your very own.The Collector's DVD is filled with a whack of stuff. Commentary from the well-spoken director Cohen, a making-of-documentary, deleted scenes, an article called Racer X that inspired the film, three music videos, storyboards, multiple angles of scenes, and tons more. I guess after seeing it, it deserved its success in 2001. You have to respect Diesel for giving up 20 million dollars to be in a sequel.

I saw this movie on DVD and I have a pretty decent setup, so when I popped this sucker in and watched it in DTS, I was blown away. There are several other interesting action scenes but nothing that comes close to the energy of the street race. Vin Diesel was the best thing about this movie next to the ""tricked out"" rides. I'm not gonna rag him too much but dude, don't be a slave to the machine. Do movies that are a little riskier, like Pitch Black.

Vin Diesel, as usual, manages to rise above some pretty cheesemo dialogue and make conflicted-dude Dom into someone fascinating. This guy is one hell of an actor. Paul Walker, playing protagonist Spindler, is pretty but not terribly charismatic; he has a kind of blonde-Keanu thing going on. Diesel and Chad Lindberg, as ADD-afflicted mechanic Jesse, are more engaging.

One more thing:  in one of the race scenes, which wasn't an event with spectators, these two guys tried to beat a train!

Ya know other companies make nitrous oxide set-ups,but Nitrous Oxide Systems must have really shelled out the bucks for this gig! The wheelstanding Dodge Charger at the end was really BOGUS! However,I was happy to see it roll into a big heap of scrap. I am a big car racing fan,but when I hear misused racing references and bogus stunts it makes me want to deface the DVD.

No rating,An uncut music video.,"I remember watching the trailer of ""The Fast and the Furious"" in cinemas. After watching the trailer I decided it maybe a decent enough movie, with plenty of thrilling car chases through huge cities kind of like ""The Italian Job"" and ""The Driver"" style...I was wrong.The Fast and the Furious feels more like a two hour music video than a movie. What we have here is a load of loonies thinking their really cool in their powered-up Honda's with hi-fi systems so loud that they could probably wake the dead. Add in a load of muscle-bound punks, girls who try their up most to look sexy and tough and we have this dumb minded movie.
Confusion also reigned during this movie, whats with the fight at the start of the movie? Lame.As for the car chases...they weren't what I was expecting, it's just drag racing in flashy cars. A lot of people have praised this movie for having fantastic stunts and yes there are a few decent one's towards the end but they aren't that mesmerising  ...I've seen better.The directer obviously thought he was creating some kind of ""way cool"" movie for the youth of today. With the likes of Limp Bizkit booming in the background, it's a shame this movie will seem old and out dated within a few years. If your looking for a decent car chase movie watch either ""The Driver"" or ""The Italian Job"" the cars didn't look as good...but at least those movies had a plot and decent actors.4/10",Jonathan Horner,"Sep 1, 2002"
No rating,"Point Break but with Cars. (Trust me, that's a good thing...)","I've got to be honest. My expectations were low, I couldn't be bothered to watch it at the cinema, I couldn't even be bothered to rent the DVD. I waited until it was on satellite so I didn't have to pay money out to watch it. I am a fool. It was hugely enjoyable. Sure, there was no plot, the acting ranged from average to awful, the love story was pointless and left unresolved, the story(?) was obvious, as was the ending, but still after all that, I loved it.If you liked Point Break, then you'll love this because it's basically the same film. Street car racing replaces surfing, Vin Diesel replaces Patrick Swayze, Paul Walker replaces Keanu Reeves and high speed robberies replace bank raids.

No rating,Not that bad actually,"I read the reviews on IMDB last week and thought that this film would probably suck beyond recognition.Yesterday I had the choice of AI and this. I wanted to see AI but my friends wanted to see this. I almost went to AI alone but they persuaded me that watching a film on your own is crap. Which it is. So I thought, 4 quid down the drain. It's not mine so who cares?Then almost 2 hours later I was out of the cinema and I thought, money well spent. The truth is, the film isn't half bad. People moaning about the storyline are right in part. The storyline isn't that bad itself, but it was just executed with the wit of a mule.The stunts are amazing. Really cool stunts include cars driving under speeding trucks and staying in control, plus a wheelie from a dodgy corvette.Anyway the film was alright. The story of the lead guy being undercover and gaining the trust of the crooks is quite good but here it could have been better. There was one moment I will remember above all and it's the moment that I reckon was the most tense in the entire film. Most people won't remember it but I just happened to. Anyway I won't give any details but basically it's when he blows his cover to the lead crook. The look on the bald guy (Vin Diesel)'s face gave that scene more suspence than any other. But then it's just wasted after that.The film ends with us perhaps not knowing what will follow but it's not hard to work out what probably would have done if it were continued a bit longer.The acting wasn't actually that bad. That Vin Diesel bloke was criticised by a lot of people on this site but there's a bit where he talks about his dad's death and i thought he shined then. And the others weren't that bad anyway.Overall the film is worth a watch if you're looking for a little action that's easy on the mind.

No rating,Slight-of-hand cinematic trickery for the young and the gullible,"Okay, I know this film was aimed at the 18-25 year market, and I watched it fully aware of the fact it would be filled with roaring supercharged cars and equally supercharged attitudes, but there was one glaring oversight that ruined the total effect for me.  During the street racing scene, where the contestants successfully blocked off about 100 amazingly straight blocks of downtown LA with no apparent notice by the police or unsuspecting motorists, didn't anyone notice that the same supporters, friends, and female groupies were at the finish line RIGHT AFTER the racers arrived?  I mean, no sooner had these guys pulled up than their adoring fans, who had been at the starting line, were piling all over their cars.  What, did they follow them at the same 100+ mph speeds, or did they take the side streets?  And I'd still like to know how they managed to block off all those intersections with hundreds of spectators without tipping the rest of LA off.  For my money, I'd still take ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" or the classic ""Vanishing Point.""

For starters the plot, camera work, editing, soundtrack, acting and special effects are all shocking, and the dialogue is crap.  Very much a B grade movie trying to be something better but failing miserably.  It uses every cliche in the book, copied straight from Point Break(except that was a good movie with good actors), has terrible continuity, jumps all over the place, has ridiculous technical aspects (the way they shot the harpoon into the truck and climbed across the cable to hijack it ...get real!!!).

The audience I sat in ate it up!As long as a movie studio can market and successfully test a movie AND it connects with an audience, it's golden (the film's release date was moved back, by the way, but only because the studio execs at Universal were confident that it could compete with other big summer movies).  I will go as far as saying this will be the sleeper hit of summer 2001. There are enough elements here (good looking stars, cool soundtrack, lots of action, and for the romantics a love story) for it to appeal to a large audience.As for the rest of you who are perhaps a bit older or not into cars:  You'll probably walk out of the theater with a headache after all the bone-crunching stunts and loud hiphop and hard rock on the soundtrack.Personally, I was totally entertained.  Imagine taking the CGI technology of the special effects from STAR WARS and the energy of THE ROAD WARRIOR and combining them with road racing -- that will give you a good idea what the race/action scenes are like in this flick.I am into cars.

Yes, there was little to no plot. Yes, the dialogue was weak and the acting was below mediocre. Yes, some parts were incorrect (NOS is inflammable). But that was not the point of the movie.

How this movie ""catapulted"" stars Vin ""Every Race"" Diesel and Paul ""Keanu"" Walker to the A-list boggles the mind. One, if you're making a movie about import cars, 20 to 1 people are going for the cars because they can relate. Two, if you're making an 'action' movie about import cars, you'll at least need a decent story to build around it. Three, if you're making a movie about import cars, please please please do not add a rap artist with no acting talent make a 'cameo' AND make the soundtrack to the movie.
Well, ""F&F"" violates those three sacred Ebertclone rules of making a good Import Car movie. One, the movie WAS about the cars but hack/aging hipster/ director???Rob Cohen (Dragon, The Skulls) wanted to exploit the rising star who is known as Vin Diesel (aka Mark Vincent, whether he likes it or not). Hey, let's just make him the anti-hero, the one we're not sure we should root for! Two, instead of thinking of a story (we have that thing called a brain), let's just rent ""Point Break"" (coincidentally a Keanu/Patrick Swayze movie) and replace the surfing boards with import cars! And hey, let's make the bad guys Asian, because they haven't been the bad guys in the past 30 years of filmmaking! Three, let's get that midget no-talent Ja Rule to make a cameo in our movie because at the time he was at the top of the charts! Let's give him the dumbest lines uttered in movie history too! And give him the right to produce a horrible soundtrack too.Nobody stands out in this movie. Not Michelle ""Testosterone Pumped"" Rodriguez, Matt ""I'm A Bad Ass"" Schulz, and not even the stunning Jordana Brewster.  Okay, maybe if she got naked, I would actually like this movie a tad, but unfortunately she doesn't so this movie fails on all 'gears'. This movie even bites off ""Point Break's"" ending, showing no faith in the characters that they 'sketched'. The dialogue is atrocious, the action is implausible, and borderlines on parody ala ""Commando.""  In fact, I believe ""Commando"" to be a way better film than this crap. The funny thing about this movie is that everything is taken seriously. Right down to the last line: ""I owe you a ten second car."" No, like we didn't see that coming. Stay far away.

Basically, the races should've been shorter, and the chases should have been more original. The set up of cars chasing a semi was given its ultimate form in The Road Warrior.  That is the ultimate expression of that setup.  Nothing in this movie comes close to the stunt work and energy of the chases in Road Warrior or Mad Max. Now, other movies have done cars chasing a semi, such as Black Dog, but none have been as similiar as Fast and the Furious. You've a guy hanging on the front of the truck, you've got the truck driver using a shotgun, you've even got similar car wrecks.

No rating,silly,"I didn't like this movie because he ""racing"" in it is nothing more than driving really fast down a straight path and seeing who can hit the nitro button first. I was expecting hairpins, fast turns and intense action, but all I got was a bunch of ghetto teens sitting in fast cars and without doing much steering, push one solitary button every 10 seconds that makes them go turbo before their engines overheat and die. Quite frankly if they were travelling that fast in those type of car, the cars would have tore themselves apart. Vin Diesal sounds like he's talking in slow motion and thus sounds very dumb. Thumbs down.",Gideon40,"Jul 13, 2002"
No rating,point break on wheels.....,"close your eyes and paul walker sounds just like keaneu reeves, there isn't much difference. otherwise i enjoyed the movie. vin diesel still thinks that he is selling stock to boiler room victims, he still hasn't made the break to being a quality actor. i look forward to seeing more of jordana brewster.",davidgraf88,"Jan 14, 2002"
No rating,A wolf in sheeps clothing!,"The cars were cool , the acting was OK , the stunts were impressive. But ... as i started to watch the film and realised that i had to take my brain out to enjoy it i noticed that the plot and story were a BLATANT rip off of a great film called Point Break which starred Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves.There are so many similarities , its unbelievable.For any of you that have seen both films think about it ... and if not , check out Point BreakA rookie undercover cop is sent to infiltrate a gang that is suspected of doing some high profile robbery. The cop befriends a girl (a waitress!!!) to get into the gang. The ringleader however seems to have some personal deathwish and has no regard for his own life. The cop gets a bit too pally with the ringleader and when it comes to the crunch and he has to bust him for his crimes he can't do it. Also , the cop reveals his identity to the girl and she hates him for it.There are some differences granted (at the end) but somebody i'm sure has watched Point Break and thought 'hey , we could remould this and make another film out of it!' ....It's a shame if thats the case. Rob Cohen is a cool director and has done some great stuff in the past ..... but this film was a no-no",xlevver,"Mar 11, 2002"
No rating,Four Skid Marks!!,"Wow - where are all the drive-ins this movie should be playing at?? Roger Corman would be very proud of this trashy, enjoyable little film. It somehow works. The standard plot chugs along yet there are little interesting touches scattered throughout that shows some dimension to the characters. Great actions scenes and stunts. Rob Cohen has shot the film beautifully (even though his cameo as the Pizza Hut delivery guy needed direction! Hee hee). Walker as the lead cop is a bit bland, but overall this film works.",shark-43,"Jun 25, 2001"

No rating,It was PointBreak all over again.,"Ever see Point Break with Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze? The Fast and The Furious is the exact same plot, only instead of surfing, this movie has fast cars. Swayze has been replaced with Vin Diesel, and the actor portraying Reeves' role is as close to Keanu as Skeet Ulrich is to Johnny Depp. Everything about this movie was set up just so that it would look ""cool"" on camera. The dialogue was absolutely dripping with cheese. Example: ""I live my life a quarter mile at a time. For those ten seconds, I'm free."" If you ever hear anyone say things like that, slap them because they have watched The Fast and The Furious too many times. The final few sequences were okay, the semi trailer chase being the best of the whole movie. See this movie in order to know what an exceptional rip off of Point Break it is. Other than that, avoid it like the plague.",Fyarl,"Feb 25, 2002"
No rating,Point break + Gone in 60' - good acting = The Fast and the Furious,"Believe me, the equation is 100% right. Go see it if you don't believe me.

No rating,Started out slow but then it went into overdrive!,"I did not catch this at the theaters. I own like 400 DVD's and I see a great number of movies so I can't catch them all in the theater. I knew that I would probably check this out when it came out on DVD. It looked cool, but not great. My friends told me that this was the coolest movie ever and it was the best that they had ever seen. After viewing it I must say that it wasn't the coolest movie ever, but it was pretty cool. All you have to do is just sit back, relax, and don't think. If you watch this and think a lot you might not enjoy it. The first 30 minutes I did just that, but then I started to get into the movie and just enjoy it. Af first it was a little slow, but then I really got into it and I stayed there. The driving scenes were really great. The stunts were unbelievable! All in all this was a cool movie that I think warrants a viewing if not a purchace. 8.5/10",dvdmrp,"Jan 21, 2002"
No rating,The Fast and the Hyddeous,"For movie go-ers these days there isn't much of a variety to choose from. You have the stupid Julia Roberts love stories, the stupid antics of Jackie Chan who's trying to be a funny Chuck Norris, and then the stupid action flicks with no plot. Every once and awhile you will find a movie that makes you think a little bit about society or whatever its subject happens to be. On the surface Fast and the Furious appears to be a stupid action flick with a retarded plot with awesome actions scenes as its only saving grace. Well, this is mostly true. The plot is bland and doesn't make any sense, a bunch of low down dead beats who appear to have no real jobs who can afford a bunch of crappy foreign cars. I'll take my Chevy K-5 any day thank you very much. But on to business. This movie actually has a deeper meaning than is inherently visible. This movie is actually a reversal of several biblical stories woven into a nice finish at the end. The director of this movie, Rob Colen, and Gary Scott Thomsen, adaptor of the screen story, bothattended King's College at Cambridge and this influence is once again present in this work. While studying at Cambridge both men were entranced by the works of C.S. Lewis and other great classics such as Homer's Odyssey and the bible. This story is not about car racing, love or any other stupid themes like that. What Thomsen and Colen have done here is reverse the outcome of several biblical and mythological stories. One that weighs heavily here is the Tower of Babel. ""The shadow of that Hyddeous Strength, Sax Myle and more it is of length."" This popular quote from the Welsh poet Sir David Lyndsay from his work entitled Ane Dialog, describes the tower of babel as observed in reference to the Fischer King mythology. The Tower of Babel crumbled from a lack of communication according to the myth. That could just as well happen in this representation of the system, but the undercover cop learns to communicate on a spiritual level with the racers, thus learing the importance for maintaining the honor of the racing world, and protecting the true protaganists at the end of the movie. Colen and Thomsen also appear to have taken elements from Greek mythology in the making of this movie as well. Consider these lines from Homer's Odyssey. ""Stand beside me, Athena, fire me with daring, fierce as the day we ripped Troy's glittering crown of towers down....Surely I will stand beside you, not forget you, not when the day arrives for us to do our work..."" Doesn't this sound familiar to you from the movie? The conversations held before the night street race, before the big finale. Yes, Colen and Thomsen have not only made references in this film to biblical and mythological works but succeeded in blending them together seamlessly. The only thing they forgot was to include Billy Drago in their brilliant cast of actors. This movie has a deep meaning for today's society, as we crumble due to communication barriers all over the world. But people still can stand side by side with others and accomplish great things. I know, I was in the field as a soldier for many years and can tell you that brotherhood can still run strong in this fading world. If every movie was as inspiring as this one, no one would ever want to leave the theater again. In other words...

No rating,what a silly film,"The Fast and furious may have been exciting, it may have been fun, but cor blimey it was daft.For starters, the crime. Now they may have used cars, and done it at very very high speeds, but essentially they were nicking a few VCRs, a crime more often associated with bored teenagers. With the amount of time and money the LAPD put into this, you'd think drugs, guns or murder would be involved.The races certainly must have been fun to watch. From A to B, straight line, GO! This kind of racing makes formula one seem almost EXCITING, though not quite. what WOULD have been cool would be to see the cars being hurled round tight corners, handbrake turns, that kinda stuff.And where the hell did they get this cop? The Rehabilitation of Speed Junkies and Former Joy Riders Scheme? If were the LAPD, I wouldn't trust no testosterone fuelled, just out of puberty, wannabe boy racer with not just one, but TWO $10,000 cars.As for the plot (it's there if you look hard), I know it's a cliche for these kind of movies but it was So predictable. And the dialogue wasn't much better - the bit when Jesse was saying grace was so cheesy I couldn't even laugh. For me, the coolest guys in the film were the chinese.
But then again, it WAS exciting, there WERE shiny cars which made lots and lots of BRRRUM noises and went fast. Oh well, I guess I just don't have the right mentality for these kind of films.",lukewozere,"Oct 12, 2001"
No rating,leave the brain at home and the losers at the lights,"I didn't expect much other from TF&TF than an adrenaline soaked action flick with buckets of loud noises, and thus I was definitely not disappointed.""Gone in 60 seconds"" might be a suitable film to compare it to-it's a cut above that and has far more excitement,even if it shares the same lack of depth of character development.The driving scenes were superb-especially the first race and the Civics chasing the truck in a Mad Max stylee. The sound effects were also outstanding,with the tuned up engine growls, dump valve hisses and turbo whines captured beautifully.Let's not dwell on the sub ""Point Break"" plot (he's a crim,no he's a cop,now he's the crim's mate again).It was pretty thin-but as an excuse for more car chases it worked.So overall 7/10 visuals 8/10 sound 10/10 plot 3/10",chopperchubb,"Sep 26, 2001"

No rating,"A Great, Action-Packed, Rockin Movie!!!","The Fast and the Furious was a great movie!!! The movie had a good cast which included Paul Walker (Varsity Blues), Vin Diesel (Saving Private Ryan), Jordana Brewster (The Faculty), and Michelle Rodriguez. This movie had AMAZING special effects and was loaded with action. Rob Cohen directed it brilliantly and Neal H. Moritz produced the movie well. This is a highly recommended movie! If you liked ""Gone In Sixty Seconds"" (2000), you will love this movie. This movie was great, and if you haven't seen it, see it now, or you are missing out on a lot of action and fun!

No rating,DIRTY MARY CRAZY LARRY it ain't,"I should've gotten off on it: the previously undistinguished director, Rob Cohen, stages two of the most amazing action set pieces of recent vintage--a nighttime drag race that approaches ""2001"" trippiness, and a car-and-truck joust that seems to smash together virtuoso sequences from DUEL and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. And the whole thing seems (deliberately or not) to be suffused with an aura of Roger Corman/AIP down-and-dirtiness. I amused myself trying to think of how it would have been cast in 1973: Jan-Michael Vincent as Paul Walker, and...Robert Blake as Vin Diesel? There's even Ted Levine, giving a fine performance as the requisite drive-in-movie Good Guy Cop in a Bad Suit.So what's not to like? Well, Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster, basically. The movie has Gary Busey attitude but a Freddie Prinze, Jr. heart. Though Diesel is a good actor, he seems to have a thought bubble above his head that says, ""Hmmm! I seem to be turning into the gen-y Stallone! I think I like it!"" Walker tries hard and probably isn't worse than most male ingenues of this sort in the post-Gary Wopat era. But Brewster, a handsome, burnished-skinned, Ali McGraw type, is much too suburban and poshy for the white-trash role of Diesel's waitress sister, and Rodriguez, as Diesel's main squeeze, scrunches her face up into a just-sucked-a-lemon sneer and keeps it locked there for two hours.Where is this era's Robert Mitchum--hell, where is its Michael Madsen? The movie's heart is in the right place, and it's engaging enough, but it needs some guys who seem to have never in their life, not once, touched a bottle with the word ""moisturizer"" on it.",nunculus,"Jul 27, 2001"
No rating,Cool-ified No Man's Land (1987),"This movie's been called a rip-off from Gone in 60 Seconds. Well I'd add up No Man's Land (1987) to the list; minus the unhappy ending. Same story: undercover cop goes into the biz, gets the thrill of racing. Difference is that this flick looks ""cooler"" because of the cars, the hard rock, the chicks ... even though this clandestine drag-racing exists, it was pushed to the ""way too unreal"" world. I doubt any street racer would have his car filled with ""Verisign"",""Verizon"" and other propaganda; it would bring even more attention to the cops. Its street racing, not NASCAR.It is mildly entertaining, but there is merely ONE car chase scene in the whole movie (more like a ""chase the bike"" scene). The dialog's cheesy, the plot's swiss-cheesed (full of holes), and there is no real action (except for the aforementioned scene). There's not even enough racing, for the movie tries to develop the ""plot"" ... without success.If you are looking for car chase movies, go get No Man's Land (1987), The Driver or Ronin. This isn't that kind of movie.",danixdefcon5,"Sep 5, 2002"
