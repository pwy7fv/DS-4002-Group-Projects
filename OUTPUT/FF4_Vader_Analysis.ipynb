I admit it, I really wanted to be able to drive like that. I watched the two sequels, only too fast too furious stuck out due to the good music. Tokyo drift just didn't cut it, it wasn't \\\"fast and furious\\\" by any standard. it was nice to see that most of the original cast was back, they seemed to be right back in the roles that i had come to love in the original! my roommate and i went to the theater with very anxiously, even though we had both seen the trailers. the opening bit was AMAZING!!! i was literally sitting on the edge of my seat. both my roommate and I were so wrapped up in the movie we were dancing to the beats while still sitting! despite our apprehensions going into the movie we walked out with our minds blown! it was that good. the cars, the men, the driving, the little bit of romance and the awesome ramming scene.if you ever were looking for a good time, even if only for 2 hours, this is your ticket. great movie, go see it!! 10 out of 10!!\",\n          \"Though I was extremely excited about this movie coming out, I honestly it would be somewhat disappointing. But I was very surprised. I absolutely loved how they integrated things from the first movie into it; the old house, the old car, even Dom's cross and leather jacket. It basically brought in things from the first and third movie which is great because the second one was crap, in my opinion. This movie was a lot more emotional and serious compared to the others. Vin Diesel did a fantastic job playing the broken-hearted hero with the tough macho exterior. You could really feel his pain. It was better, I think, than his character in 'A Man Apart' in which he was also seeking revenge. I would have really liked to see more of Michelle Rodriguez, though, just so the four main characters could actually be reunited again. And it would have been nice to see more of Sung Kang. He was basically in it for five minutes, said something about Tokyo and then he was gone. They should have delved more into the history that was touched on in Tokyo Drift. The cars used in this one were also great. But like I said before, it feels like this sequel was more concerned with the plot and emotions involved rather than just the action - not to say that the action sequences didn't make me jump a little. The only thing I would complain about is the ending. It was a nice concept because it echoed the beginning, but it left me with the feeling that nothing was solved in the movie because it put them all right back where they started. Overall: great plot, explosive action, hot boys and hot cars - I give this movie 9 out of 10. :)\",\n          \"Fast and Furious, or 4 Fast 4 Furious if you're keeping count, is a movie you can basically sum up in one sentence. Muscle guys, muscle cars, hot chicks, and incredible action sequences. Not much has changed in the four films other than who the muscle guys wind up being played by but nonetheless, if you're going to the movies strictly to continually watch these things, then not only will this series run forever, but you should have no problem sitting through this fourth flick. Of course the other thing to look at here is the resurrection of Vin Diesel's action star persona, and considering he's been doing movies like \\u2018Babylon AD\\u2019 and \\u2018The Pacifier\\u2019 for the past couple years, you can basically say this is one of his better performances in a real long time. The plot is pretty thin but I'm sure for fans of the first movie it will be nice to see the two leads back playing their roles. Diesel reprises wanted felon Dom Toretto, who after escaping at the end of the first movie seems to have started a new life in the Dominican Republic knocking over trucks. What brings him back to Los Angeles is revenge for the death of his girlfriend (Michelle Rodriguez) at the hands of brutal drug dealers led by Braga. This brings him face to face with the man who infiltrated his gang in the first flick, Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), now an FBI agent going after the same drug dealers. And wouldn't you know that driving plays a big part in Braga's whole smuggling operation so both Brian and Dom team up, amidst some trust issues, to bring down the drug cartel. Hopefully director Justin Lin (\\u2018Tokyo Drift\\u2019) gets the credit he deserves this time around. He's fantastic with these action sequences, not only making them pulse-pounding thrill rides but also letting you feel like you're in the car with these characters. The movie starts out brilliantly with a propane truck hi-jacking that turns life or death when things get out of control and the truck barrels down on the hi-jackers, and then just continues to go full throttle, staging a race on a crowded Los Angeles street and then chases in an underground tunnel shaft. Once these characters get in their cars you won't be bored for a moment. Outside the car is a different matter though. Both actors do what they can. Diesel is adrenaline personified. With his gravelly voice, bulging biceps, and cool, playful way around a line of dialogue, he's a lot of fun to watch. And while still pretty wooden, I admit that Walker has a pretty-boy face and an athletic physicality that makes him a good hero. This pairing worked well in the first movie, sort of like an amateur, yet entertaining, version of the adrenaline-seeking- cop and criminal formula a la \\u2018Point Break.\\u2019 Just after four movies it's all gotten stale and it's easy to see that the cars are the real stars here. The Dom-Brian conflict and Dom's vendetta against the cartel is mostly overshadowed and there isn't much for either character to do when away from their vehicles. Diesel and Walker try but they always seem to be a couple wheels short of competing with the four-wheel drive. \\u2018Fast and Furious\\u2019 deserves credit for doing the key things well. If your expecting much from anything other than the cars then it's a disappointment, but thanks to Justin Lin this has all the makings of a really thrilling action movie, making this fourth flick in the series a little bit better than its predecessors and a lot of fun.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Author Name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 66,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"beccakwalsh13\",\n          \"n_retandy\",\n          \"C-Younkin\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2009-04-08\",\n          \"2009-04-01\",\n          \"2009-04-05\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 2009,\n        \"max\": 2009,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2009\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

I admit it, I really wanted to be able to drive like that. I watched the two sequels, only too fast too furious stuck out due to the good music. Tokyo drift just didn't cut it, it wasn't \\\"fast and furious\\\" by any standard. it was nice to see that most of the original cast was back, they seemed to be right back in the roles that i had come to love in the original! my roommate and i went to the theater with very anxiously, even though we had both seen the trailers. the opening bit was AMAZING!!! i was literally sitting on the edge of my seat. both my roommate and I were so wrapped up in the movie we were dancing to the beats while still sitting! despite our apprehensions going into the movie we walked out with our minds blown! it was that good. the cars, the men, the driving, the little bit of romance and the awesome ramming scene.if you ever were looking for a good time, even if only for 2 hours, this is your ticket. great movie, go see it!! 10 out of 10!!\",\n          \"Though I was extremely excited about this movie coming out, I honestly it would be somewhat disappointing. But I was very surprised. I absolutely loved how they integrated things from the first movie into it; the old house, the old car, even Dom's cross and leather jacket. It basically brought in things from the first and third movie which is great because the second one was crap, in my opinion. This movie was a lot more emotional and serious compared to the others. Vin Diesel did a fantastic job playing the broken-hearted hero with the tough macho exterior. You could really feel his pain. It was better, I think, than his character in 'A Man Apart' in which he was also seeking revenge. I would have really liked to see more of Michelle Rodriguez, though, just so the four main characters could actually be reunited again. And it would have been nice to see more of Sung Kang. He was basically in it for five minutes, said something about Tokyo and then he was gone. They should have delved more into the history that was touched on in Tokyo Drift. The cars used in this one were also great. But like I said before, it feels like this sequel was more concerned with the plot and emotions involved rather than just the action - not to say that the action sequences didn't make me jump a little. The only thing I would complain about is the ending. It was a nice concept because it echoed the beginning, but it left me with the feeling that nothing was solved in the movie because it put them all right back where they started. Overall: great plot, explosive action, hot boys and hot cars - I give this movie 9 out of 10. :)\",\n          \"Fast and Furious, or 4 Fast 4 Furious if you're keeping count, is a movie you can basically sum up in one sentence. Muscle guys, muscle cars, hot chicks, and incredible action sequences. Not much has changed in the four films other than who the muscle guys wind up being played by but nonetheless, if you're going to the movies strictly to continually watch these things, then not only will this series run forever, but you should have no problem sitting through this fourth flick. Of course the other thing to look at here is the resurrection of Vin Diesel's action star persona, and considering he's been doing movies like \\u2018Babylon AD\\u2019 and \\u2018The Pacifier\\u2019 for the past couple years, you can basically say this is one of his better performances in a real long time. The plot is pretty thin but I'm sure for fans of the first movie it will be nice to see the two leads back playing their roles. Diesel reprises wanted felon Dom Toretto, who after escaping at the end of the first movie seems to have started a new life in the Dominican Republic knocking over trucks. What brings him back to Los Angeles is revenge for the death of his girlfriend (Michelle Rodriguez) at the hands of brutal drug dealers led by Braga. This brings him face to face with the man who infiltrated his gang in the first flick, Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), now an FBI agent going after the same drug dealers. And wouldn't you know that driving plays a big part in Braga's whole smuggling operation so both Brian and Dom team up, amidst some trust issues, to bring down the drug cartel. Hopefully director Justin Lin (\\u2018Tokyo Drift\\u2019) gets the credit he deserves this time around. He's fantastic with these action sequences, not only making them pulse-pounding thrill rides but also letting you feel like you're in the car with these characters. The movie starts out brilliantly with a propane truck hi-jacking that turns life or death when things get out of control and the truck barrels down on the hi-jackers, and then just continues to go full throttle, staging a race on a crowded Los Angeles street and then chases in an underground tunnel shaft. Once these characters get in their cars you won't be bored for a moment. Outside the car is a different matter though. Both actors do what they can. Diesel is adrenaline personified. With his gravelly voice, bulging biceps, and cool, playful way around a line of dialogue, he's a lot of fun to watch. And while still pretty wooden, I admit that Walker has a pretty-boy face and an athletic physicality that makes him a good hero. This pairing worked well in the first movie, sort of like an amateur, yet entertaining, version of the adrenaline-seeking- cop and criminal formula a la \\u2018Point Break.\\u2019 Just after four movies it's all gotten stale and it's easy to see that the cars are the real stars here. The Dom-Brian conflict and Dom's vendetta against the cartel is mostly overshadowed and there isn't much for either character to do when away from their vehicles. Diesel and Walker try but they always seem to be a couple wheels short of competing with the four-wheel drive. \\u2018Fast and Furious\\u2019 deserves credit for doing the key things well. If your expecting much from anything other than the cars then it's a disappointment, but thanks to Justin Lin this has all the makings of a really thrilling action movie, making this fourth flick in the series a little bit better than its predecessors and a lot of fun.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Author Name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 66,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"beccakwalsh13\",\n          \"n_retandy\",\n          \"C-Younkin\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2009-04-08\",\n          \"2009-04-01\",\n          \"2009-04-05\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 2009,\n        \"max\": 2009,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2009\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

I admit it, I really wanted to be able to drive like that. I watched the two sequels, only too fast too furious stuck out due to the good music. Tokyo drift just didn't cut it, it wasn't \\\"fast and furious\\\" by any standard. it was nice to see that most of the original cast was back, they seemed to be right back in the roles that i had come to love in the original! my roommate and i went to the theater with very anxiously, even though we had both seen the trailers. the opening bit was AMAZING!!! i was literally sitting on the edge of my seat. both my roommate and I were so wrapped up in the movie we were dancing to the beats while still sitting! despite our apprehensions going into the movie we walked out with our minds blown! it was that good. the cars, the men, the driving, the little bit of romance and the awesome ramming scene.if you ever were looking for a good time, even if only for 2 hours, this is your ticket. great movie, go see it!! 10 out of 10!!\",\n          \"Though I was extremely excited about this movie coming out, I honestly it would be somewhat disappointing. But I was very surprised. I absolutely loved how they integrated things from the first movie into it; the old house, the old car, even Dom's cross and leather jacket. It basically brought in things from the first and third movie which is great because the second one was crap, in my opinion. This movie was a lot more emotional and serious compared to the others. Vin Diesel did a fantastic job playing the broken-hearted hero with the tough macho exterior. You could really feel his pain. It was better, I think, than his character in 'A Man Apart' in which he was also seeking revenge. I would have really liked to see more of Michelle Rodriguez, though, just so the four main characters could actually be reunited again. And it would have been nice to see more of Sung Kang. He was basically in it for five minutes, said something about Tokyo and then he was gone. They should have delved more into the history that was touched on in Tokyo Drift. The cars used in this one were also great. But like I said before, it feels like this sequel was more concerned with the plot and emotions involved rather than just the action - not to say that the action sequences didn't make me jump a little. The only thing I would complain about is the ending. It was a nice concept because it echoed the beginning, but it left me with the feeling that nothing was solved in the movie because it put them all right back where they started. Overall: great plot, explosive action, hot boys and hot cars - I give this movie 9 out of 10. :)\",\n          \"Fast and Furious, or 4 Fast 4 Furious if you're keeping count, is a movie you can basically sum up in one sentence. Muscle guys, muscle cars, hot chicks, and incredible action sequences. Not much has changed in the four films other than who the muscle guys wind up being played by but nonetheless, if you're going to the movies strictly to continually watch these things, then not only will this series run forever, but you should have no problem sitting through this fourth flick. Of course the other thing to look at here is the resurrection of Vin Diesel's action star persona, and considering he's been doing movies like \\u2018Babylon AD\\u2019 and \\u2018The Pacifier\\u2019 for the past couple years, you can basically say this is one of his better performances in a real long time. The plot is pretty thin but I'm sure for fans of the first movie it will be nice to see the two leads back playing their roles. Diesel reprises wanted felon Dom Toretto, who after escaping at the end of the first movie seems to have started a new life in the Dominican Republic knocking over trucks. What brings him back to Los Angeles is revenge for the death of his girlfriend (Michelle Rodriguez) at the hands of brutal drug dealers led by Braga. This brings him face to face with the man who infiltrated his gang in the first flick, Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), now an FBI agent going after the same drug dealers. And wouldn't you know that driving plays a big part in Braga's whole smuggling operation so both Brian and Dom team up, amidst some trust issues, to bring down the drug cartel. Hopefully director Justin Lin (\\u2018Tokyo Drift\\u2019) gets the credit he deserves this time around. He's fantastic with these action sequences, not only making them pulse-pounding thrill rides but also letting you feel like you're in the car with these characters. The movie starts out brilliantly with a propane truck hi-jacking that turns life or death when things get out of control and the truck barrels down on the hi-jackers, and then just continues to go full throttle, staging a race on a crowded Los Angeles street and then chases in an underground tunnel shaft. Once these characters get in their cars you won't be bored for a moment. Outside the car is a different matter though. Both actors do what they can. Diesel is adrenaline personified. With his gravelly voice, bulging biceps, and cool, playful way around a line of dialogue, he's a lot of fun to watch. And while still pretty wooden, I admit that Walker has a pretty-boy face and an athletic physicality that makes him a good hero. This pairing worked well in the first movie, sort of like an amateur, yet entertaining, version of the adrenaline-seeking- cop and criminal formula a la \\u2018Point Break.\\u2019 Just after four movies it's all gotten stale and it's easy to see that the cars are the real stars here. The Dom-Brian conflict and Dom's vendetta against the cartel is mostly overshadowed and there isn't much for either character to do when away from their vehicles. Diesel and Walker try but they always seem to be a couple wheels short of competing with the four-wheel drive. \\u2018Fast and Furious\\u2019 deserves credit for doing the key things well. If your expecting much from anything other than the cars then it's a disappointment, but thanks to Justin Lin this has all the makings of a really thrilling action movie, making this fourth flick in the series a little bit better than its predecessors and a lot of fun.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Author Name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 66,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"beccakwalsh13\",\n          \"n_retandy\",\n          \"C-Younkin\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2009-04-08\",\n          \"2009-04-01\",\n          \"2009-04-05\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 2009,\n        \"max\": 2009,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2009\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Sentiment Overall\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Negative\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Negative Score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.04786878919526771,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.261,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 55,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.074\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Neutral Score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.05559998868038321,\n        \"min\": 0.59,\n        \"max\": 0.904,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 58,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.757\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Positive Score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0623455163044096,\n        \"min\": 0.008,\n        \"max\": 0.275,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 63,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.173\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Overall Percentage Score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.7012803892155893,\n        \"min\": -0.9888,\n        \"max\": 0.997,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 64,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.3859\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Dom comes to Letty's LA funeral and goes after her killer. This puts him on a collision course with Brian who is also trying to take down a big time drug dealer named Braga.There are more great driving stunts and just some great stunts altogether...fight scenes, explosions...and definitely some great cars, all held together with a thrilling soundtrack.Dominican Republic, Mexico and LA are all backdrops for this great fast and furious reunion.

Dom comes to Letty's LA funeral and goes after her killer. This puts him on a collision course with Brian who is also trying to take down a big time drug dealer named Braga.There are more great driving stunts and just some great stunts altogether...fight scenes, explosions...and definitely some great cars, all held together with a thrilling soundtrack.Dominican Republic, Mexico and LA are all backdrops for this great fast and furious reunion. This might be my second favorite film (next to the first) in the series thus far.\",\n          \"Beastly movie. Awesome action, great racing scenes, good story. Lots of creative ways to improve on the racing parts. Hate-able villains. So many awesome intense scenes and omg moments. Was pretty deep like the original movie with some good emotional moments and character relationships. Even small things reminded me that we're back in the world created by the original, like dinner with family with a nice song playing, or mia yelling \\\"dom stop!\\\" lolit has lots of flaws but this movie is a great time. It brought the series back to where it needed to be. It captured the feel of the first movie.
