Doesn't know the English name for it. Not the line through the movie but some of the things that happen in it. Feels like the script writer took some help from that movie! But came up with a better movie!!\",\n          \"For movie go-ers these days there isn't much of a variety to choose from. You have the stupid Julia Roberts love stories, the stupid antics of Jackie Chan who's trying to be a funny Chuck Norris, and then the stupid action flicks with no plot. Every once and awhile you will find a movie that makes you think a little bit about society or whatever its subject happens to be. On the surface Fast and the Furious appears to be a stupid action flick with a retarded plot with awesome actions scenes as its only saving grace. Well, this is mostly true. The plot is bland and doesn't make any sense, a bunch of low down dead beats who appear to have no real jobs who can afford a bunch of crappy foreign cars. I'll take my Chevy K-5 any day thank you very much. But on to business. This movie actually has a deeper meaning than is inherently visible. This movie is actually a reversal of several biblical stories woven into a nice finish at the end. The director of this movie, Rob Colen, and Gary Scott Thomsen, adaptor of the screen story, bothattended King's College at Cambridge and this influence is once again present in this work. While studying at Cambridge both men were entranced by the works of C.S. Lewis and other great classics such as Homer's Odyssey and the bible. This story is not about car racing, love or any other stupid themes like that. What Thomsen and Colen have done here is reverse the outcome of several biblical and mythological stories. One that weighs heavily here is the Tower of Babel. \\\"The shadow of that Hyddeous Strength, Sax Myle and more it is of length.\\\" This popular quote from the Welsh poet Sir David Lyndsay from his work entitled Ane Dialog, describes the tower of babel as observed in reference to the Fischer King mythology. The Tower of Babel crumbled from a lack of communication according to the myth. That could just as well happen in this representation of the system, but the undercover cop learns to communicate on a spiritual level with the racers, thus learing the importance for maintaining the honor of the racing world, and protecting the true protaganists at the end of the movie. Colen and Thomsen also appear to have taken elements from Greek mythology in the making of this movie as well. Consider these lines from Homer's Odyssey. \\\"Stand beside me, Athena, fire me with daring, fierce as the day we ripped Troy's glittering crown of towers down....Surely I will stand beside you, not forget you, not when the day arrives for us to do our work...\\\" Doesn't this sound familiar to you from the movie? The conversations held before the night street race, before the big finale. Yes, Colen and Thomsen have not only made references in this film to biblical and mythological works but succeeded in blending them together seamlessly. The only thing they forgot was to include Billy Drago in their brilliant cast of actors. This movie has a deep meaning for today's society, as we crumble due to communication barriers all over the world. But people still can stand side by side with others and accomplish great things. I know, I was in the field as a soldier for many years and can tell you that brotherhood can still run strong in this fading world. If every movie was as inspiring as this one, no one would ever want to leave the theater again. In other words... \\\"Fe astudiodd gerddoriaeth gyda'i dad, oedd yn arweinydd seindorf yn, ac yna ym Mhrifysgol Ial. Ei gyfansoddiadau fe fyddai...\\\"\",\n          \"Does just what it is supposed to do ... give you an adrenaline rush. Players are well cast for the parts. Subtle digs on police and FBI so listen to the dialog well. If you ever raced illegally, this will bring back those moments and make you want to drag again!

Doesn't know the English name for it. Not the line through the movie but some of the things that happen in it. Feels like the script writer took some help from that movie! But came up with a better movie!!\",\n          \"For movie go-ers these days there isn't much of a variety to choose from. You have the stupid Julia Roberts love stories, the stupid antics of Jackie Chan who's trying to be a funny Chuck Norris, and then the stupid action flicks with no plot. Every once and awhile you will find a movie that makes you think a little bit about society or whatever its subject happens to be. On the surface Fast and the Furious appears to be a stupid action flick with a retarded plot with awesome actions scenes as its only saving grace. Well, this is mostly true. The plot is bland and doesn't make any sense, a bunch of low down dead beats who appear to have no real jobs who can afford a bunch of crappy foreign cars. I'll take my Chevy K-5 any day thank you very much. But on to business. This movie actually has a deeper meaning than is inherently visible. This movie is actually a reversal of several biblical stories woven into a nice finish at the end. The director of this movie, Rob Colen, and Gary Scott Thomsen, adaptor of the screen story, bothattended King's College at Cambridge and this influence is once again present in this work. While studying at Cambridge both men were entranced by the works of C.S. Lewis and other great classics such as Homer's Odyssey and the bible. This story is not about car racing, love or any other stupid themes like that. What Thomsen and Colen have done here is reverse the outcome of several biblical and mythological stories. One that weighs heavily here is the Tower of Babel. \\\"The shadow of that Hyddeous Strength, Sax Myle and more it is of length.\\\" This popular quote from the Welsh poet Sir David Lyndsay from his work entitled Ane Dialog, describes the tower of babel as observed in reference to the Fischer King mythology. The Tower of Babel crumbled from a lack of communication according to the myth. That could just as well happen in this representation of the system, but the undercover cop learns to communicate on a spiritual level with the racers, thus learing the importance for maintaining the honor of the racing world, and protecting the true protaganists at the end of the movie. Colen and Thomsen also appear to have taken elements from Greek mythology in the making of this movie as well. Consider these lines from Homer's Odyssey. \\\"Stand beside me, Athena, fire me with daring, fierce as the day we ripped Troy's glittering crown of towers down....Surely I will stand beside you, not forget you, not when the day arrives for us to do our work...\\\" Doesn't this sound familiar to you from the movie? The conversations held before the night street race, before the big finale. Yes, Colen and Thomsen have not only made references in this film to biblical and mythological works but succeeded in blending them together seamlessly. The only thing they forgot was to include Billy Drago in their brilliant cast of actors. This movie has a deep meaning for today's society, as we crumble due to communication barriers all over the world. But people still can stand side by side with others and accomplish great things. I know, I was in the field as a soldier for many years and can tell you that brotherhood can still run strong in this fading world. If every movie was as inspiring as this one, no one would ever want to leave the theater again. In other words... \\\"Fe astudiodd gerddoriaeth gyda'i dad, oedd yn arweinydd seindorf yn, ac yna ym Mhrifysgol Ial. Ei gyfansoddiadau fe fyddai...\\\"\",\n          \"Does just what it is supposed to do ... give you an adrenaline rush. Players are well cast for the parts. Subtle digs on police and FBI so listen to the dialog well. If you ever raced illegally, this will bring back those moments and make you want to drag again!

The film follows an undercover cop (Paul Walker) who infiltrates a gang of high-speed thieves led by the charismatic Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel). With heart-pumping racing sequences, stunning stunts, and a talented cast, this movie is a must-see for adrenaline junkies. The chemistry between the leads is undeniable, and the film's themes of loyalty, friendship, and rebellion add depth to the high-octane action. Director Rob Cohen's slick direction and the film's pulsating soundtrack make for an unforgettable viewing experience. A classic of the early 2000s, The Fast and the Furious is a wild ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.\",\n          \"The first Fast and Furious movie I stumbled into by accident was Tokyo Drift and much to my surprise I loved it. So now because I have heard so much about how great the latest instalment was I have been going back and watching them all. The first film certainly has a strong appeal to it. Car movies are not necessarily my thing, I don't know a lick about cars except how to drive (and my wife would say even that is questionable.) Still the original film in this series also is one of the only ones I have seen outside of Tokyo Drift that is still truly about fast cars and racing. The series eventually evolves into more of a heist/criminal underworld sort of spin but this is truly about the cars. Right off the bat you're dropped into the action and there is some truly excellent action scenes. The characters are not brilliant but they are well defined and interesting despite being very predictable and stereotypical. One thing the Fast Furious series forces down your throats is the idea that this group is a \\\"family\\\" and will do anything for each other. They start this concept in this movie and then repeat it over and over and over again. A smarter series would let you feel that devotion and friendship with character development. But it is what it is, a simple action flick that entertains.\\n\\nThis cast has made their bread and butter with this series. Vin Diesel is a star from this series and a few other roles but mostly this. He fits into it like a round peg into a round hole. He is a good anti-hero and his rough tough as nails charisma works in the movie. Paul Walker also made his name in this series. He is the yin to Diesel's yang. He is softer spoken, the red blooded all American type who is undercover within this gang and becomes one of the family. Walker is a little stiff in his performance and he certainly isn't flexing any major acting muscles but he is a necessity to the story and his chemistry with Diesel works very well. Jordana Brewster is Diesel's sister and Walker's love interest and she does decently. Her character gets very little development but she has a purpose and serves it well. Her chemistry with Walker is solid and their romance is definitely worthwhile. Michelle Rodriguez is Diesel's love interest and I think they actually have great chemistry, very hot on screen but she is very underused in this movie. I was surprised she got such a name from being in this because she is definitely a supporting character and way in the background most of the time. Rick Yune is decent but completely underused and under developed as the \\\"villain\\\" o sorts. He could have been much better but the character is too weak. Chad Linberg does a terrific job in a very small role and gives one of the stronger performances especially in a supporting role.\\n\\nThe film relies entirely on its stunts, fast cars and action scenes. The cast and performances are adequate at best but thanks to a constant stream of adrenaline it ends up being very entertaining. Rob Cohen has a history as a director of relying on adrenaline to make his films. He might be one of the most shallow directors in the way that his movies have very, very little depth. These films, especially this one, is the definition of mindless entertainment. You have to turn off your brain and sit back and enjoy the spectacle. I'm not in any way saying there is anything wrong with that because I was thoroughly entertained. I don't quite understand the massive following this series has but this time I was pleased with the film so what can I say. Be ready to be entertained but not overly impressed. 8/10\",\n          \"We are all tired of fast cars as a central plot, but this is where it pretty much all started. The Fast & Furious epitomizes Racing Movies. Granted, they aren't my favourite type of movies to watch, but this one really hits the nail on the head.Foolproof storyline, star studded cast (for it's time) and of course, testosterone. Fast and Furious reeks of it, but I can only take so much. Yeah sure it was moderate action but, whether this was before HD or not, the way the cars looks when traveling at super speeds were far to fake for me. It looked cheesy and the green screen was obvious. Plus the acting of some of the cast was sub-par. I mean, who would of though that putting Ja Rule in a film would be prosperous. Mediocre at rapping, what makes you think he would be auspicious for a motion picture.I can't ignore the giant pink elephant in the room so lets get right to it. Vin Diesel. The bravado that follows Diesel in ever film he appears in is present here. In one of the ending scenes where Paul Walker's character reveals something shocking, the look that was given by Dom (Vin Diesel) was chilling in every sense of the word. He definitely out shined the rest of the actors. But Johnny Tran (Rick Yune)really surprised me. He made for a very compelling antagonist and I really wish he was is in the recent Fast & Furious'. All in all, you must see this revolutionary racing film. It has it's flaws but what movie doesn't? But what do I know I'm just a 15 year old boy.~Caesar Drake\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Author Name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 373,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"aloismawunde\",\n          \"Robert_duder\",\n          \"y-a-z3689\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 307,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2021-04-12\",\n          \"2015-10-04\",\n          \"2019-10-19\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 3,\n        \"min\": 2011,\n        \"max\": 2025,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2020,\n          2022,\n          2011\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The film follows an undercover cop (Paul Walker) who infiltrates a gang of high-speed thieves led by the charismatic Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel). With heart-pumping racing sequences, stunning stunts, and a talented cast, this movie is a must-see for adrenaline junkies. The chemistry between the leads is undeniable, and the film's themes of loyalty, friendship, and rebellion add depth to the high-octane action. Director Rob Cohen's slick direction and the film's pulsating soundtrack make for an unforgettable viewing experience. A classic of the early 2000s, The Fast and the Furious is a wild ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.\",\n          \"The first Fast and Furious movie I stumbled into by accident was Tokyo Drift and much to my surprise I loved it. So now because I have heard so much about how great the latest instalment was I have been going back and watching them all. The first film certainly has a strong appeal to it. Car movies are not necessarily my thing, I don't know a lick about cars except how to drive (and my wife would say even that is questionable.) Still the original film in this series also is one of the only ones I have seen outside of Tokyo Drift that is still truly about fast cars and racing. The series eventually evolves into more of a heist/criminal underworld sort of spin but this is truly about the cars. Right off the bat you're dropped into the action and there is some truly excellent action scenes. The characters are not brilliant but they are well defined and interesting despite being very predictable and stereotypical. One thing the Fast Furious series forces down your throats is the idea that this group is a \\\"family\\\" and will do anything for each other. They start this concept in this movie and then repeat it over and over and over again. A smarter series would let you feel that devotion and friendship with character development. But it is what it is, a simple action flick that entertains.\\n\\nThis cast has made their bread and butter with this series. Vin Diesel is a star from this series and a few other roles but mostly this. He fits into it like a round peg into a round hole. He is a good anti-hero and his rough tough as nails charisma works in the movie. Paul Walker also made his name in this series. He is the yin to Diesel's yang. He is softer spoken, the red blooded all American type who is undercover within this gang and becomes one of the family. Walker is a little stiff in his performance and he certainly isn't flexing any major acting muscles but he is a necessity to the story and his chemistry with Diesel works very well. Jordana Brewster is Diesel's sister and Walker's love interest and she does decently. Her character gets very little development but she has a purpose and serves it well. Her chemistry with Walker is solid and their romance is definitely worthwhile. Michelle Rodriguez is Diesel's love interest and I think they actually have great chemistry, very hot on screen but she is very underused in this movie. I was surprised she got such a name from being in this because she is definitely a supporting character and way in the background most of the time. Rick Yune is decent but completely underused and under developed as the \\\"villain\\\" o sorts. He could have been much better but the character is too weak. Chad Linberg does a terrific job in a very small role and gives one of the stronger performances especially in a supporting role.\\n\\nThe film relies entirely on its stunts, fast cars and action scenes. The cast and performances are adequate at best but thanks to a constant stream of adrenaline it ends up being very entertaining. Rob Cohen has a history as a director of relying on adrenaline to make his films. He might be one of the most shallow directors in the way that his movies have very, very little depth. These films, especially this one, is the definition of mindless entertainment. You have to turn off your brain and sit back and enjoy the spectacle. I'm not in any way saying there is anything wrong with that because I was thoroughly entertained. I don't quite understand the massive following this series has but this time I was pleased with the film so what can I say. Be ready to be entertained but not overly impressed. 8/10\",\n          \"We are all tired of fast cars as a central plot, but this is where it pretty much all started. The Fast & Furious epitomizes Racing Movies. Granted, they aren't my favourite type of movies to watch, but this one really hits the nail on the head.Foolproof storyline, star studded cast (for it's time) and of course, testosterone. Fast and Furious reeks of it, but I can only take so much. Yeah sure it was moderate action but, whether this was before HD or not, the way the cars looks when traveling at super speeds were far to fake for me. It looked cheesy and the green screen was obvious. Plus the acting of some of the cast was sub-par. I mean, who would of though that putting Ja Rule in a film would be prosperous. Mediocre at rapping, what makes you think he would be auspicious for a motion picture.I can't ignore the giant pink elephant in the room so lets get right to it. Vin Diesel. The bravado that follows Diesel in ever film he appears in is present here. In one of the ending scenes where Paul Walker's character reveals something shocking, the look that was given by Dom (Vin Diesel) was chilling in every sense of the word. He definitely out shined the rest of the actors. But Johnny Tran (Rick Yune)really surprised me. He made for a very compelling antagonist and I really wish he was is in the recent Fast & Furious'. All in all, you must see this revolutionary racing film. It has it's flaws but what movie doesn't?
