9,10.0,my no1 film,This film made me. This has always been my favourite film probably because of the way they form the group it's iconic. The cast is just brilliant I can't imagine it was someone else and also the end seen my favourite thing. Danza Kuduro playing in the back chest it's amazing and I really feel like everyone should watch,miacoop,2021-01-11,2021
121,8.0,"If they failed on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th attempts, why not on the 5th attempt? And yes, they did it with praise !!","Of everything that involves this franchise (car racing / police investigation) and (besides the first film) that the sequences did not give a certain reason for existence that only made these films increasingly monotonous and uninteresting, ""Fast Five"" leaves aside what started this franchise with a more moving and frantic action movie, with characters even more fun to follow in their ""exploits"".",prietoheitor,2021-01-16,2021
44,10.0,Best action film,"Last week I saw Fast and Furious 5 / Fast five at the home. The main actors in this film are Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, and Dwayne Johnson... This film is an action thriller . This film is a story of two guys, Bryan who is an ex-policeman, and Dominic Torreto which is one of the best race drivers, and this hobby connects these two guys. These two guys have a plan how to steal 100 million dollars so they must do a really good team which will help them. But cop Hopps wants to catch them because Dominic and Bryan must be in prison for their actions. But in the end, he finds out they are not bad people and he helps them. The characters of Paul and Dominic are interesting because in the last films they weren't really good friends. But now they will be a true family and their adventures will be better . However, this film is really about friendship between all these characters. In my opinion, Fast and Furious films are one of the most popular in the world, so this film was fast-moving and gripping all the time. Special effects and stunts were so impresive. Like in all Fast and Furious films this has to some good music songs. I think is a ""tradition"" when these films have a good music.",imdb-58910,2021-02-07,2021
35,8.0,"Fast Five (2011, Justin Lin) The Fast franchise morphs into a large spectacular monster with this film","Fast Five (2011, Justin Lin) 'Fast Five' is named such because it is the 5th installment of the mega successful Fast & Furious franchise. If you take a look at billion dollar movies and take away comic book movies and James Cameron films about all that's left are Fast & Furious films along with some Disney/Pixar films which is impressive considering its rather humble roots, and you can easily point to this fifth installment where the series changed tactics and became something different, grander in scale and scope. The series always boated a wonderfully diverse cast, but this film gives the misfit street racer family an exotic locale to go with the super charged vehicles and it also assembles the core of what would be the team going forward. From the outset there was Vin Diesel's Dominic Toretto, Paul Walker's Brian O'Connor and Jordana Brewster's Mia Toretto. This cobbled together people who had appeared in other films including Ludacris, Tyrese Gibson and Sung Kang as fan favorite Han. Additionally they added the future Wonder Woman in Gal Gadot and Dwayne Johnson who collectively tripled the sex appeal of the film. To further ramp up the profile of the series instead of dealing with a simple street racer plot they started to vault into international intrigue on the scale of something that James Bond might handle. The crew inadvertently becomes their own version of an Impossible Mission Force. The show starts off with the crew on the run and Dom in prison. After a high profile escape featuring some pretty slick car work they wind up hiding in Rio de Janeiro which is a wonderful location for shooting due to the gritty yet colorful beauty of their urban sprawl capped by the ever watchful Christ the Redeemer statue and Sugarloaf. The crew not only runs afoul of the local drug kingpin, but also is being hunted by an elite CIA backed bounty squad headed by Johnson's Luke Hobbs. He starts as an attack dog, but by the climax he becomes an ally and would go on to be a legit team member in future installments. There are stories that behind the scenes Diesel and Johnson are often at odds for control over the series. While evading Hobbs the team goes to war against this drug lord that winds up being capped by a ridiculous but adrenaline charged chase scene that becomes an instant classic. It involves two Dodge Chargers pulling a bank vault through the streets of Rio using it as a weapon. This film is incredibly fun. It consistently reinforces the family theme which comes to be a hallmark for these films. There is not as much racing in this film as they skew away from that deliberately and turn toward more action based set pieces that happen to involve vehicles. As the installments move into the future those action set pieces get more and more eye popping and outlandish so back in 2011 the 'Fast Five' ones are relatively tame considering where they have gone. The direction is frenetic and gorgeous thanks to Justin Lin. The script is well written with good action, tension and humor. The action surely boils over into outlandish territory, but they embrace it so thoroughly that it only adds to the enjoyment of the overall endeavor. The wonderful location, amazing array of actors, slick script and elevated action plot really serve to make 'Fast Five' the pivotal film of this series and a paradigm shift that would serve to launch this film franchise into the stratosphere.

123,4.0,Not good,"It focuses on the characters way too much, and doesn't have enough high action car chases, that's what I want from a fast and furious movie.The plot line of Brian and Mia about to have a child is totally unnecessary, and it feels like a rushed production.",asherrbh_15,2021-05-06,2021

42,5.0,Finally broke down and watched one of these things,"I never had any interest in the Fast and the Furious movies, which I'd never even heard of until it became the nickname for a political scandal. It sounded like something with a bunch of people racing cars and maybe committing or solving crimes or something. I don't care about speedy cars, I'm not into racing videogames, I'm definitely not the target audience.Recently I saw a trailer for a new one though, and I thought, this looks kind of fun. But since that movie got bad reviews I decided I would learn which was the best in the series and watch that.The movie was pretty much what I expected, cars and guns and muscly guys. It's stupid from the first brief action scene, which should have killed about 30 people but somehow doesn't. Then there's some unlikely plot, a bunch of driving and shooting, predictable twists, more shooting, a bunch of running.As action movies go, this seems vastly familiar to both the martial arts films of stars like Jet Li and Jackie Chan and the special effects driven superhero genre, and I don't get the appeal at all. But listen, it's not trying to entertain me, it's trying to entertain cars & muscly guys freaks, and if this sounds like something you'd like you'll probably like it.",cherold,2021-05-25,2021

You can tell that this is where the craziness started getting out of hand but at least in Fast Five they still balance it pretty well. My only minor gripe is that they didn't get actual Brazilians to be the bad guys and when they speak portuguese it is either bad or heavy ADR.",drewnes,2021-05-30,2021

33,10.0,Fast Five has a great set of characters and is action packed from start to finish - My Ultimate Review,"Fast Five or Fast & Furious 5: Rio Heist as it's also known as, it's the third Fast & Furious film Justin Lin have directed and it's once again written by Chris Morgan. This installment gets the franchise to the action and roots that made me fall in love with the Fast films, gripping and suspenseful action sequences that make you sit at the edge of your seat. The focus on heists is the right move, they make it brilliant and entertaining, how a box office hit should be and succeeded. I won't lie the logic in these movies disappear more and more but they are entertaining. Having this movie take place in Brazil and Rio was an excellent choice. Also the cast and likeable characters are all memorable. Justin Lin's direction is one of the highlights in Fast Five, absolutely amazing. Chris Morgan's story and script is a huge step forward than the previous film, he did a great job. The dialogue was at times below average but I don't mind bad dialogue if the characters and actors execution is good and they are.Fast Five continues where the previous film left off. It follows Dominic Toretto, Brian O'Conner and their team as they plan a heist to steal $100 million from corrupt businessman Hernan Reyes while being pursued for arrest by U. S. Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs. The ensemble cast has Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang, Tego Calderon and Gal Gadot. The new additions are Dwayne Johnson as Luke Hobbs, Joaquim de Almeida as Hernan Reyes and Elsa Pataky as Elena Neves. The new cast members are appreciated and so is the returning cast.On the technical side of things, they really outdid themselves. The quality have gone up on every aspect, sound editing and the whole production. The editing still amazes me, action sequences and non action ones. The pacing is fast and fits perfectly with the film. The cinematography have improved too, I still love the camera work and how they edit the car sequences, truly masterly done by them.What I truly love about this film is how they use practical effect and all the stunts, Paul Walker did all of his stunts and I'm sure Vin Diesel did too. The stunt involving the flatbed truck slamming into the moving train was filmed practically, if I remember correctly the last sequence involving the bank vault was also done practically or at least most of it. The action feels real and it's thanks to the stunt coordinator and stuntmen.What the Fast Saga does well is that it never slows down, movies about cars should only get faster and Fast and Furious will never slow down. After many viewings, I still love this film. Dare I even say that it's one of my favorite action films.",Holt344,2021-06-11,2021
7,10.0,Running Ain't Freedom,Fast Five is hands down The Best Fast & Furious Movie it's a lot of fun never takes it's foot off the gas the action is amazing I loved it I highly recommend the Extended Version.,jasonmichaeldickinson,2021-06-25,2021
51,10.0,Fast Five,"Amazing! This is the best Fast and Furious movie out of the first five. In a way, it was the culmination of the first 4 movies before it. Dom, Brian, and Mia are on the run in Brazil after breaking Dom out of a prison transport. They then decide to do a job with their old friend from the first movie, Vince because they need the money. The job goes wrong, and Dom, Brian, and Mia find out the one car they got away with has a chip that holds all of the info to where a billionaire holds his money. Dom, Brian, and Mia plan on stealing it, but they need a team. They recruit Roman, and Tej from 2 Fast 2 Furious, Han from Tokyo Drift, and Fast 4, and Gisele, Leo, and Santos from Fast 4. A lot more happens, they get Luke Hobbs, and Elena, two cops on their team because their team got murdered by the billionaire's men. Their job then got harder, but in pure Fast and Furious fashion, they end up pulling it off with an amazing chase through the streets of Rio with a safe attached to the back of their car destroying everything in sight. It is exactly what I expect from the Fast and Furious movies, and they did it better than ever in this one. Another thing I liked was how they decided to make the theme of this movie a heist. The first three all stayed with the street racing theme, the fourth changed a bit to drug smuggling/revenge, and this one was a heist.

This was the best movie in the series out of the first five and it isn't even close. I recommend this to anyone who wants to watch it even if they haven't seen the previous movies because this movie was action packed beyond belief.",kaden_lewis,2021-07-04,2021

60,8.0,Smarter and Better,"The Fast and the Furious films just keep getting better. Straying away from the street-racing scene was one of the smartest decisions the producers could have made.

The film follows Dom & Brian on Heist Mission traveling from country to country while being pursued by Federal Agents & trying to avoid them!

I found the film to be pretty good! As with the previous films it's entertaining if not more as the 5th entry is when things really start to get bigger in terms of story, characters & of course, action!

The eye candy is great as always as with the creative action sequences which again this 5th film starts to mark after the 4th entry! I think each sequel seems to never disappoint & this is an example!

111,8.0,A Much needed rejig for the franchise,"Fast Five aka Fast & Furious 5 or Fast & Furious 5: Rio Heist is a heist action film directed by Justin Lin and written by Chris Morgan. The film stars Vin Diesel, Late Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang, Tego Calderon, Don Omar, Gal Gadot, Dwayne Johnson, and Joaquim de Almeida.The film is the fifth installment in fast and furious series.This film is one of the best film of the series and with the introduction of Dwayne Johnson has gave the much needed boost to the series and also the credit should be given to makers by instilling new life in the series by introducing heist along with some car chases as the car racing were getting too monotonous. This step had not only increased the viewers base but also leased a new life in the franchise.The plot and the screenplay is flatly predictable but is still enjoyable, the funny scenes here and there will keep you entertained and the fast paced screenplay will keep you engaged.The stunts and action in the film is marvelous and few of the action scenes and stunts can be called as the major highlights of the film.Acting is good to decent and almost all the characters were honest and dedicated to their character, the only drawback which i felt was that the character of the antagonist in the film was not cooked properly or was under shadowed in the hoard of another actors. This role should've been developed more precisely and if they would have done the film could've been more grand, but sadly in this film the villain looked too week and isn't memorable.Climax of the film is also predictable as it's plot but is very entertaining and gives a satisfying pleasure. If you are a fan of fast and furious series or if you are a fan of heist series then this is the film for you. A much needed rejig for the franchise and eventually saved the franchise.",sauravjoshi85,2021-09-09,2021

4,5.0,The Fifth Time They Pull Their Last Job,"Vin Diesel is broken out of prison by the usual gang. With Dwayne Johnson in hot pursuit, they head off to Rio De Janeiro, where they steal some hot cars in the first practical effects showpiece. They turn out to belong to druglord Joaquim de Almeida; they discover he stored all his extensive papers detailing his evil empire and a hundred million dollars in cash in one of the cars, as one does, and decide to steal that for the second big practical effects showpiece as yet another last job they'll ever do.There are some fine performers here, but the cars are the real stars, and more work is done to make sure you can hear the engines than the dialogue. No one in the intended audience has ever heard of a muffler apparently. Still, the things they put these cars through is astonishing, if you like that sort of thing.

Fast Five (also known as Fast and Furious 5 outside North America) is primed to equal if not better the $71 million opening weekend of its 2009 predecessor. Director Justin Lin, back for his third go-around, opens it up in top gear; a mere 30 seconds elapse before the first screech of tires rent the air. The film is set in a much grittier Rio than the recent screen version populated by animated birds. This is the most expensive installment yet and it's clear the budget wasn't used on acting lessons for the cast.Dwayne Johnson appears to be having fun with his overzealous staccato delivery.

104,10.0,you will not regret the time spent,"The film that started the new series of ""Fast and Furious"" films, ""Fast and Furious 5"". The film that brought together all the beloved characters from the previous films into one huge ensemble. Add to that Dwayne Rock Johnson, and you have arguably the best thing ever in the franchise. I had a hard time choosing which of the F&F movies is the best/my favorite. 5, 6 and 7 are all great. They know exactly what type of movies they belong to and what type of movies they don't. Perhaps ""Fast and Furious 5"" ranks first for being the first to truly embrace the ridiculousness of the franchise. Even the previous film sometimes felt a tone deaf to the script. However, ""Fast and Furious 5"" takes the series to a whole new level in terms of tone, characters and even genre. In many ways, it was a mild reboot of the series. Essentially, the characters became superhumans with qualities they didn't have before. As far as I'm concerned, Tej has never been a technical genius, Mia has never been able to hack into police scanners, and Roman has never been afraid of anything. All of this was added to serve the story they wanted to tell in Fast and Furious 5. And you know what? I'm totally fine with it. A soft reboot is exactly what these movies needed. If that's what we need to make sure the characters pull off a crazy heist and have a lot of fun? I'm all for it. The Rock (aka the Viagra franchise) adds another layer to the movie. Gone are the days when Dom and Brian attacked each other. Now 260 pounds of pure muscle haunts the whole team, and it's worth it. Not only is it mind-blowingly entertaining to watch Diesel and Johnson fight, Johnson brings a lot to the role of Hobbs. These movies have always sought to create an internal code/moral for each character, and Hobbs' code fits perfectly with and confronts Dom's code. Apparently, this role was originally intended to be played by Tommy Lee Jones, but I can't imagine anyone better than The Rock. Like the previous film, ""Fast and Furious 5"" does a great job of recapturing old relationships, developing new ones, and doubling down on the action. This series is half about family and half about how crazy every stunt and action sequence can be. By this point, they've pretty much abandoned street racing in favor of heists, and it works. Heck, even the one time they have a ""race,"" it happens behind the scenes. The Fifth Fastener is the epitome of what the series has become, and I'm not sure any movie could match the incredible pacing and infectious chemistry between the ensemble members. +Turn on the Rock +Dom vs. Hobbs +Double the emotion and action +Mild reboot serves the series well -Even if some of the character changes don't make much sense.",jibiw-05244,2022-01-19,2022

It is probably from this part of the Fast & Furious series that they move from films about racing to action films. But it's still insanely spectacular and some scenes even fascinate the eye. New and old characters fit well into the new story and are in excellent contact with each other (throwing jokes to each other or comparing who has a car faster). Musically, this episode was not so memorable, except for ""Danza Kuduro"" by Don Omar and Lucenzo, no other song comes to mind. Speaking about the plot, it is not as interesting as it was in part 4, and the plot ""we need money and we will rob a rich uncle"" does not go very well.",kelvinselimor,2022-09-02,2022
103,8.0,"Fast Five brings the action, beloved old characters, exciting new ones, and a whole lot of fun to the Fast franchise and the heist genre.","Fast 4 and Fast 5 are the best of the Fast & Furious franchise. Fast 4 redeemed the series after the failure of Tokyo Drift by bringing back Vin Diesel and the cast and family of the first film. Then Fast 5 expands and adds to the crew with fan-favorite characters from across the series, including Han (Kang), Roman (Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Gisele (Gadot), and more. The Toretto family plans a massive heist to buy their freedom but hot on their tale is Dwayne Johnson's Hobbs, a perfect foil to Diesel's Toretto. The face-off between these characters is epic! Fast Five's bonkers action is a little more grounded than later entries, but it's still outrageous fun. It feels kind of like The Italian Job, directed by Michael Bay. Fast Five launched the Fast Franchise into another decade of insane stunts and stories with great characters and commitment to embracing its cheesy awesomeness.",Paragon240,2022-09-17,2022
40,10.0,The Fast and the Unfaithful,"Fast five, the 5th movie from the Fast and Furious Franchise follows the lives of criminals who consider themselves family. This movie holds a worldly perspective of passion, loyalty, and what it means to live life on the edge. From a Biblical worldview, it is obvious to say that the lives these characters live are not godly one's. Choosing violence, committing multiple felonies, immorality, and drinking. They are not on a path of righteousness. 1 Corinthians 10:31 says, ""So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."" Saying grace over a family meal is one thing, but professing and glorifying God through one's actions, speech, and the people they follow, attest to whether one is pursuing a godly lifestyle or not. As seen in the movie, prayer before a meal becomes the means to their profession of belief. Prayer to God before a meal and having fellowship with family is a great thing; however, their life is inconsistent. Is the movie cinematically well done? Absolutely! Is the movie portraying or promoting a Christian worldview? No. I hope this review is helpful for anyone curious!",mercedesmontoya-12649,2022-12-07,2022
83,9.0,Everything You Want In This Genre,"This movie takes everything that was exciting and thrilling about the previous installments and brings it all together and even in many ways elevates it. The start isn't anything too spectacular , but the moment they bring all of the characters together for the mission is absolutely epic. Sometimes when franchises try to merge characters from one movie with another it is clunky and underwhelming, but all these characters truly come together to form a family. The dialogue is fantastic and the comedy is on point. Every character is used in a way that allows the film to progress nearly without flaw.The only downside I would argue is that the villain was extremely average and checked every box off as a caricature of the corrupt, money laundering, South American organized crime leader. Still, the fact the movie was as fantastic as it was even with a middling villain proves how fantastic it truly was.",ThereelscoopwithKK,2023-02-28,2023

It basicly have everything you can ask for from a Fast and Furious movie!This movie Feels like the finale movie in the series, as it brings together our favorite characters from the previous movies, in the current timeline! It is over the top, but not as much as the later entries! The plot is also easy to understand, and not overly complex!This is an easy to enjoy action packed thrillride, with emotional, satisfying and intense moments! The last part of the movie is just bonkers and i LOVE it!

67,8.0,A Very Good Addition To The Franchise,"The fifth installment of this fun franchise.This time the action moves to Brazil, where we follow Dominic Toretto and the other characters as they try to rob a powerful criminal. Some new characters enter the story, such as Hobbs, played by Dwayne Johnson. His character is a fun addition to the franchise.The scenography is good, the soundtrack could be a little better, but it's not bad. The characters are over the top, but that's what's fun about this type of movie.A combination of action, humor and a fun story, this movie doesn't try to be something it's not, this is a movie that wants to entertain us.It is excellently directed, the car chase scenes are interesting, fun and look great.

20,7.0,A Thrilling Heist that Ignites a New Era of the Franchise,"""Fast Five"" propels the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise to new heights with its electrifying blend of high-octane action, intense heists, and an ensemble cast firing on all cylinders. Picking up where the previous installment left off, the plot follows Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), and their crew as they plan a daring heist in Rio de Janeiro while being pursued by a relentless federal agent (Dwayne Johnson).The film takes the franchise in a refreshing direction by incorporating the elements of a heist thriller. The meticulously planned and executed heist sequences are the heart of the film, showcasing the crew's impressive driving skills, precision teamwork, and audacious strategies. Each action set piece is expertly choreographed, filled with breathtaking stunts and jaw-dropping moments that will leave you on the edge of your seat.What sets ""Fast Five"" apart is the seamless integration of beloved characters from previous films. The chemistry between the cast members is palpable, with Vin Diesel and Paul Walker delivering standout performances that anchor the film. Dwayne Johnson's introduction as federal agent Luke Hobbs adds a new dynamic to the story, bringing his own brand of intensity and charisma to the table.The plot not only delivers adrenaline-pumping action but also delves into the characters' personal lives, exploring their motivations, loyalties, and the importance of family. It strikes a perfect balance between heart-pounding thrills and emotional resonance, making us invest in the characters and their journey.The film's breathtaking cinematography captures the vibrant streets of Rio de Janeiro, providing a visually stunning backdrop for the high-speed chases and explosive action.

22,7.0,Where everything changed,"As a teenager, I thought this was the best in the franchise and it makes sense considering how much action-packed it is and the whole ensemble coming together and their banter in it. But this time around for the first 40 minutes I was confused why this was the first critically acclaimed movie in the franchise because that 40 minutes was filled with stupid dialogues that is directed in the most cringey way possible with few thrills in there. But then they start assembling the crew and it became a proper heist movie and it started making sense why it is considered good. From that point on it kept entertaining throughout the movie.The Rock is way better here compared to most of his roles before this but looking back now, he wasn't as charming as his later lead roles for which he is more known for nowadays. The ensemble is really what worked the best film though. All of them together make this movie great to watch.This is where everything changed for the franchise and the scope of it really became huge but it still lacks the heart of the first movie and the tightness of Tokyo Drift. And it seemed like they wanted to connect Tokyo Drift through later movies from dialogues and I wonder how could they think that's a good idea, do they want us to think Japan in this movie's world is behind everywhere else to look like that after the events of these movies being so modern?",Jithindurden,2023-05-09,2023
23,7.0,Fast Five,"Picking up hot on the heels of the last film, the newly escaped ""Dom"" (Vin Diesel), his ex-FBI pal ""O'Conner"" (Paul Walker) and ""Mia"" (Jordan Brewster) have to keep skipping one step ahead of the pursuing law led by ""Hobbs"" (Dwayne Johnson) and, whilst cornered in Rio, they must assemble everyone with driving skills so as to thwart the ambitions of drug lord ""Reyes"" (Joaquim de Almeida) whom they have seriously hacked off. This effort sacrifices a little of the pace and speed of the other films and tries to focus on a slightly stronger story with some better characterisations - that does mean that it can be a bit on the slow side at times and maybe we get just one thoughtful pose from Diesel too many, but as we head towards a fairly predictable denouement this easily (for my money, anyway) tops the list of F&F films before clearly teeing us up for number 6. I think it's closer in quality and standard to the first film - and still has plenty of burnt rubber and lively stunts to keep it watchable.",CinemaSerf,2023-05-15,2023
47,4.0,Not that bad.,"It's a decent movie, one of the things wrong with it is that the action scenes are so unrealistic that it's almost as if you're watching a cartoon. They are constantly scenes where someone should have been permanently hospitalized or killed. And it seems like most of the movie is totally unrealistic action scenes. I'm left virtually always asking myself ""Come on, really?"" It's also very hard to keep track of who's working for who and who are the bad guys and who are the good guys. I wish it was somewhat better and had an actual plot so that I would be anxious to see the end the next movie. Other than those things, it's not a terrible movie.",dbarr123,2023-05-23,2023
76,10.0,A really large-scale film of the series,"The Fast and the Furious series approached its fifth iteration as a peculiar and diverse project. It seems that there have never been any problems with understanding the themes of the franchise throughout the series. Everyone understands that ""Fast and Furious"" is about cool cars, racing and an interesting story. However, the first four pictures are seriously different from each other, the films focus on different things. And the cast and setting varies from movie to movie. And, probably, it is the fifth ""Fast and Furious"" that sets new and now well-established rules by which the world of fast and furious exists to this day. Only the degree of unreality continues to increase. But this is already a topic for future reviews.The director of the film, Justin Lin, created a unique film that was head and shoulders above the previous pictures in the series, personally in my opinion. This is a really spectacular movie that still manages to border at the junction of the really acceptable and the fantastic.The script of the film was well worked out and did not leave the viewer indifferent. The intrigue of the film reaches its apotheosis by the final chase, which was really cool and exciting. Dragging two cars of a safe through the streets of the city for me personally today is something unimaginable and one of the most memorable excerpts from the entire series of films. The special effects in the movie are cool and realistic. Each scene is thought out to the smallest detail, which allowed us to create a unique atmosphere and breathtaking action scenes.Screenwriters Chris Morgan and Gary Scott Thompson worked out bright characters and an interesting plot that did not let the viewer get bored. The film starred many of the main actors of the franchise, including Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot, Son Gun, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Chris Ludacris Bridges and many others. Each of them created a unique and interesting character, successfully contributed to the overall picture.Heroes know how to love and protect each other, work in a team and laugh, be selfless and collected, do everything in their power for the benefit of the whole team. So, without noticing it, the characters of the picture turn into a family. And the creators are doing an important thing. They show with this picture that the most important thing in life is family. And let this thought of Dominic Toretto acquire a lot of jokes later. The message is really correct. He is important, he teaches you to be able to be a brother, sister, friend, girlfriend. Watching the characters of the picture, the viewer may well learn to be the same selfless in real life, at least at a simple everyday level.The picture takes a new peak. The heroes are finally confronted by a truly worthy opponent, who was embodied on the screen by Dwayne Johnson. The actor played FBI agent Luke Hobbs, who did not leave the audience indifferent with his charisma and impressive physical form. Elsa Pataki was also good. Also a new face in the franchise. The girl plays the role of a policeman from the Hobbs squad. Her separate story also fits perfectly into the overall outline of the picture.The film ""Fast and Furious 5"" is not just a continuation of the series, another film, of which there are many. For me, this is a really strong movie that combines several genres at once. It is perfectly visible how the entire team of creators tried to surpass themselves and shoot a really cool project. In my opinion, it turned out great. Director Justin Lin has created a unique atmosphere that keeps the viewer in suspense throughout the film. And let it be an action movie, there will definitely be a place for drama in it, and the confrontation of the characters with each other will make you watch the development of events with interest.10 out of 10.",alekspredator87,2023-05-28,2023
21,7.0,Now this is more like it!,"Review: Definitley the turning point of the Fast Franchise for the better. Mainly because of the action Heist feel and the inclusion of The Rock!

Takeaways: -Though Racing is still a big part of the movie and the Fast series, the series starting with this movie, now takes more inspiration from Heist and spy movies such as Mission impossible, and Oceans Eleven. More focus is on pulling off heists against criminals.

-Dwayne Johnson, makes his debut as no-nonsense Recovery Agent Luke Hobbs, sent to arrest Dom and his friends after Dom escaped the prison transport at the end of the fourth movie. The Texas Lawman, Luke Hobbs is a heroic good guy character, and he is mainly doing his job when pursuing Dom and Brian. However they both eventually join forces to take out their common enemy, Drug lord Hernando Reyes. The Rock himself had played a huge part in the success of this film, and he also did the same in the 6th, 7th, and 8th films.

-So the story was that the moviemakers had originally envisioned Tommy Lee Jones to play Luke Hobbs, but Star/Producer Vin Diesel decided to get Dwayne Johnson cast after hearing from fans on how much they would love to see Vin brawl against ""The Rock""

-Elsa Pataky (Mrs Chris Hemsworth) also debuts as Officer Elena Neves who becomes Dom's new love interest. She helps Dom continue to cope with Letty's death.

-Roman Pierce and Tej Parker (and Eva Mende's Monica Fuentes in a cameo) also return for the first time since 2 Fast 2 Furious. They help form Dom's team to bust the bad guys. I love the Friendship that Roman and Tej form. It's funny how they make girl chasing as their competition lol

-Enter the Fast Avengers!

-Fast five I heard was originally intended to be the last one of the series, but because of this sequel's mega success, they decided to film more movies.

Conclusion: The franchise has been retooled and revamped as the movies now make sure that the action doesn't let up for a second!",myblueblazer,2023-05-30,2023
73,8.0,Wow! I think I have a new Second favorite in the Fast and The Furious franchise!,"I loved it! This action packed, stunt filled, car heavy entry in the Fast and The Furious franchise nave have moved into the slot of my second favorite so far...causing me to reorder the series thus far:1. The Fast and The Furious (held by the first film which started the franchise and will forever remain near and dear to my heart...with a great ""family"" centered plot heavy on respect.2. Fast Five (new to this position...and I am going to call it the gang's all together)
3. Fast and Furious (Film#4 The revenge of Letty)
4. The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift (#3the high school entry set in the future)
5. 2 Fast and 2 Furious (#2...set in Miami without Dom and the gang)Film number five takes us to gorgeous Brazil, specifically Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana and Ipanema beaches, Christ the Redeemer statue atop Mount Corcovado and Sugarloaf Mountain. There are some great shots day and night across the city, including some great running stunt shots in the city's infamous favelas.There are some great stunts and some even better cars and car chase scenes...but what really makes this one of the better films in the Fast and The Furious series is the reunion of so many characters...not to mention that we get back to the great on screen chemistry and mutual respect between Brian and Dom, who are both on the run from the law with Mia. This reunites Dom, Brian, Mia, Vince, Taj, Han, Roman, Gisele, Leo and Santos and it introduces both Hobbs (played by Dwayne The Rock Johnson)and Elena as they team up to take down a Brazilian bad guy named Reyes and steal his money.Lots of local flavor this film starts with a prison break for Dom and then a meet up at Vince's in Brazil where we discover Vince has a son. He and Brian bury the hatchet and agree to do a job together for some quick cash. The job goes south, but gives them a common enemy Reyes. Meanwhile they are being hunted by an elite FBI team lead by the Old Testament Hobbs...who after loosing the majority of his team in a street fight to Reyes' men, joins forces with our guys to take him down.If you are a fan of the series or just a fan of great action films..,I think you will love this film like I do.""Mission impossible to mission insanity!""",cgvsluis,2023-05-31,2023

17,6.0,It has its moments,"Fast Five is an improvement on its predecessor. The film nicely picks up from the last film to continue the story. Bryan truly ditches his badge and fully commits to Dom and their lifestyle, he is now wanted by the authorities and on the run. This film does well with the storyline around the heist and the high stakes surrounding it. Not only are they gong after a dangerous drug lord but also everyone under his power. Also to add another level of craziness is breaking into the police station to steal his money. There are some ridiculous and unrealistic scenes towards the end of the film. How could Dom pull a locker that is lodged in concrete and drag it throughout the streets as if it was as light as a kite? These over the top and unrealistic scenes bring the film down a bit.",Kingslaay,2023-06-23,2023
15,7.0,Rio Grande,"Ohhh. We're definitely starting to get there now. If ""Fast and Furious"" was the soft reboot to set us on the new path, ""Fast Five"" is a statement of intent for the series going forward.Having been liberated from the Prison transport, the Toretto family head to South America. They reconnect with Vince (Matt Schulze) and, in need of money, get involved in a job stealing cars from a moving train. The job goes wrong, and several DEA agents are killed by men working for local Drug Lord Hernan Reyes (Joaquin De Almieda). Framed for the murders, Dom (Vin Diesel), Mia (Jordana Brewster) and Brian (Paul Walker) become a target for accomplished DSS Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson). Whilst avoiding capture, Dom decides on revenge against Reyes and calls in his friends and family for assistance.We're right at the crossover point here between the family being up against small time gangs to international terrorists. Reyes is still, I suppose, just a drug dealer, but the power he wields in Rio, over the police in particular makes him a much more dangerous opponent. Things are getting more preposterous though. The initial assault on the transport bus would clearly kill everyone on board immediately and whilst the vault heist is great (perhaps still the high point of the whole series, hence it's triumphant return in ""Fast X"") there's no getting away from the fact that they must kill hundreds of people (both cops and innocent bystanders) as part of it.The core of 'La Familia' are together now though, with Han, Giselle, Tej and Roman all together and Elsa arriving into the plot too. They're all relatively lacklustre when weighed against Dwayne Johnson though, who arrives in this series like a colossus and very nearly takes it over - it's clear why Diesel and he struggle to co-exist in the franchise after the next one.We're getting closer to the insanity - which I'm pretty sure starts in the post credits scene of this one and goes from here. Strap in.",southdavid,2023-06-30,2023
2,7.0,Above the standards.,"Fast & Furious 5 delivers action on a grander scale compared to its predecessors. As the team devises heist plans, the colorful atmosphere of Rio de Janeiro adds visual richness. Action sequences and car races remain thrilling, deepening the dynamics between characters.However, at times, the plot can become overly complex, and some characters' motivations could have been better explored. The film's runtime might feel lengthy, with certain scenes appearing unnecessarily prolonged. Moreover, instances where the laws of physics are stretched make the realism waver.In conclusion, ""Fast & Furious 5"" stands out as a chapter that caters to action enthusiasts within the series. With its large-scale scenes and character dynamics, it offers an engaging experience while showcasing some shortcomings in the plot and logic.",uhudsavascisi,2023-08-18,2023
41,8.0,"One of few enjoyable ""Fast"" movies","(2011) Fast Five
ACTION ADVENTUREA much better improvement over the last one which was overshadowed by CGI and some unrealistic car crash sequences, this time has much of the original cast from all ""Fast & The Furious"" movies appearing on this one for doing different things against a powerful kingpin in Rio with the FBI behind it's back sought for Vin Diesel and crew for an incident regarding some murdered deputies! Their are a lot of inconsistencies and plot holes regarding the story line but keeps viewers entertained by many amusing one-liners and is classified as an action adventure with a seen to be believed chase sequence regarding a large safe, hauled by two cars. Obviously inspired by ""For A Few Dollars More"" and ""The Italian Job"" but done with some panache. But what is lacking what the first one has that this one does not is the awesome musical soundtrack which always goes well with young people and driving hand in hand whether a car is driven or not, via techno-pop! I mean, the soundtrack for the first ""Fast And The Furious"" was so catchy that it made CD sells out of the original soundtrack, which this one could've provided instead of some more boring conversations to enhance the story.",jordondave-28085,2023-09-25,2023
43,10.0,Fast Five Review,"Ll time. This film reunites all actors from the previous films. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster , Tyrese Gibson , Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang, Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot, Tego Calderon and Don Omar, the gang are all here! They are all cast from the previous installments.The Director brings all new actors in the cast crew: Joaquim de Almeida, Dwayne Johnson and Elsa Pataky. The script, the players, the action scenes, the story. Everything about this film is awesome! This film kicks ass. Is my second favorite best film in the series franchise. This film for me even beats Furious 7. Cause Furious 7 is not that good as this film is. The far of the highest best films ever. It's actually probably my favorite movie that I've ever seen. If you like any of the other fast and furious movies SEE THIS ONE!!!!! It's a Epic movie watch it till all the way to the end.Fast Five picks up, literally, right where Fast & Furious left off. Dom (Vin Diesel) is on his way to prison when his partner, former undercover detective Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), and his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) stage a daring (albeit highly unlikely) prison-bus break. On the run from the police, the FBI and the media, the three hightail it across the border and head even further south, all the way to Rio de Janeiro. There, they decide to lay down, lay low and avoid any unwanted attention. Nah, I'm just kidding. They do what any international fugitives would do: rob a train, double cross a local crime lord named Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) and his right-hand man Zizi (Michael Irby), put themselves on the radar of a ludicrously musclebound U. S. Diplomatic Security Service agent (Dwayne Johnson), and set out to steal untold millions from Reyes. That's right, it's One Last Heist for Dom and Brian. Not that anyone should be foolish enough to think this is the last we'll see of the led-foot duo; not after Fast Five revved up $600 million at the worldwide box office. (Be sure to sit through the first chunk of end credits for a nice little surprise.) Fast Five boasts incredible action scenes that are all varied and equally exciting. The film is full of clean, well choreographed shots that are easy to watch and the cast works great as a whole unit, making the film's running time breeze by. The heist in Rio De Janeiro was amazing An energetic, high-octane. The film was brilliant and smart it was action fun Entertained. The fight scenes between Dwayne Jonson and Vin Diesel was tremendous. I was happy that they put someone (Dwayne Jonson) in the movie that was so smart like Dom (Vin Diesel) was. Luke Hobbs as A Diplomatic Security Service agent to track down Dom and his crew was awesome! He did a brilliant job In this Action packed sequel film! Just Lin deliver us a high octane Action packed story filled with full of cars and shootings in his film.Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Dwayne Johnson lead this all-star all-action movie with outrageous stunts, incredible cars and beautiful girls that pushes the limits into the red and beyond! The legendary Dom Torreto (Vin Diesel) partners with outlaw cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) on the opposite side of the law in exotic Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Hunted by ruthless Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and an army of corrupt cops working for a deadly drug kingpin. Torreto and O'Conner reunite the gang from previous Fast adventures to pull off one last job - an insane heist worth $100 million!""Five Times The Action!, Five Times the Fury!""I love this film to death and I love how they were planning to rob a Police Station. The first half was a little boring, but the second half was fast paced entertained filled with action. I love this film and everything about it. I love that it is 2.hrs long so that it can tell the whole story.When developing Fast Five, Universal Studios deliberately departed from the street racing theme prevalent in previous films in the series, to transform the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By doing so, they hoped to attract wider audiences that might otherwise be put off by a heavy emphasis on cars and car culture. Fast Five is considered the transitional film in the series, featuring only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as gun fights, brawls, and the heist of $100 million. The production mounted a comprehensive marketing campaign, marketing the film through social media, virtual games, cinema chains, automobile manufacturers, and at NASCAR races.",jonatanmm,2023-10-05,2023
29,10.0,All Joined for the Fifth,"The Fast and Furious series has struck us once more with a fifth movie that just keeps getting better and better. New characters, new action, and new drama. Some might say this new action surpasses the laws of physics but is that necessarily a bad thing. What distinguishes this movie from the others is that this is the first movie that gathers the characters from the past movies to create one big team or ""family"". This action movie is not just defined as an action movie, it includes developments of relationships and the creation of new ones thus offering a satisfying mix of emotion and adrenaline. It also highlights the importance of family in difficult times. It has an amazing plot, amazing cast, the greatest development of a family, and surprising plot twists.Fast Five is the first movie that sets the franchise into a new direction. It introduces the franchise into a heist-driven plot where for the first time, the team must not only outrun the law but also outsmart the ruthless drug lord in Brazil, Hernan Reyes. This finally gives the characters a chance to flex their brains as well as their muscles.The casting for this movie could not have been better. You have Vin Diesel starring as the iconic Dominic Toretto, Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner, Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto, and the newest character Dwayne Johnson as Luke Hobbs. Which better men would you rather watch fighting on your screen than Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson. The movie does not only show the power of men fighting but it also showcases the power of women and their abilities through the characters Mia and Giselle.This movie has kept its viewers on the edge of their seats because of the different plot twists. With shocking car crashes, heists, and shootouts that serve as a heart-pounding moment. Every time you think their plan is going wrong or it's going to fail, in reality it would be going exactly as they wanted. It's entertaining to watch how their plan unfolds and then discover the tricks behind it.Fast five has not failed the franchise with its trademark of exhilarating car chases. It has also succeeded in developing its characters and giving the audience a deeper understanding of them. With the relationships growing, the fast family is finally born in Fast Five. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker continue to anchor the series with their charismatic presence, and their bromance is as endearing as ever. Including Jordana Brewster whose character is revealed pregnant in the beginning thus showing the importance of maintaining the family bond.If I were to direct this film, there is not one thing I would change. It's got the cast with the perfect chemistry, the perfect script, and the perfect stunts. Yes, the stunts don't abide the laws of physics, but isn't that the fun of it? Fast Five is a spectacular addition to the Fast and Furious series, delivering non-stop thrills, a charismatic cast, and a heist plot that stirs the franchise in a new direction. If you're a fan of fast cars, big explosions, and heart-pounding action, Fast Five is a must-see. Prepare yourself for a wild ride through the streets of Rio de Janeiro.",nayahaddad-33402,2023-10-06,2023
1,7.0,The Rock Cooks,"The Fast and Furious franchise is one that is mixed in quality, while never dipping too far into being a bad film. Fast Five is one of the better films in the franchise and Dwayne Johnson is definitely the reason for that. While the story starts to feel like too much of the same thing, The Rock comes in as the power house Hobbs to counter Vin Diesel's Toretto. The dynamic between the two action stars creates a rivalry of entertainment. The on-screen chemistry between the entire cast cannot be denied and it is a joy to watch them play off each other, as family. With great effects and captivating stunts, this is a highpoint for these films and has me along for the long ride now.",Ltufano23,2023-10-16,2023
82,10.0,Fast & Furious,If you liked Fast and Furious 4 You will love Fast 5 I loved it so much Fast and Furious is one of my favorite sets of movies. My favorite part of the Fast 5 movies is when Brain. O'Connor and Mia tell everyone that Mia is pregnant and that they are going to have a baby boy. So if you do not watch Fast & Furious you need to start watching Fast & Furious because it is a great set of movies it is all about driving fast and family and their family gets bigger. Mia and Brian have a baby boy and name him Toney and it is number 6 or 7 of the Fast & Furious set of movies Dom finds out he has a son and his son's mother gets shot right in front of him.,Furious2008,2023-10-20,2023

3,7.0,Hard to rate,"I'm kinda done with this franchise, haven't seen a Fast movie since Fast 7.. But I was lucky enough to see the spinoff called Hobbs & Shaw for reasons I'm not able to explain and I heard they went into space in Fast 9 and it turned a lot of people off.. I will admit, when I saw Fast 5 on the big screen I had a blast. I honestly don't think I have ever had more fun in a movie theater. When looking back at it now, this was the beginning of the end. They went from street racing to pure action and I didn't see it coming, this movie had the element of surprise but anything made after this did not. They couldn't figure out how to top themselves to they decided to turn the characters into superheroes.. And apparently Dom has a psychopathic brother played by John Cena.. Never heard any references in previous movies and all of a sudden he's the new main villain.. I mean c'mon.. My 9 year old son can write better stories than that.This movie is arguably the most entertaining in the franchise but it truly was the beginning of the end, it spawned a bunch of sequels where dead characters were mysteriously brought back to life.. And flying cars into space. It's become pointless and stupid. I no longer feel emotionally attached to the characters. They should have ended it right here but sadly that's not the world we live in.",askeland89,2023-12-07,2023
100,2.0,Fast and Furious Five - What happened to the races?,"When I first watched the movie ""Fast and Furious,"" I also wanted to be like Brian O'conner, have an amazing car and race. And, if I can recall correctly, the movie I watched was the first one, the real essence of fast and furious. But I cannot explain how a movie that was based in racing and with some criminal bands that gave a huge range for the story to be developed, turned to be a movie in which racing is no longer racing, and focuses in the most strangest situation in which a car cannot be put, you have a big deal there, mainly for those who liked the original essence of the film.

The reason why I chose this exact movie from the saga is for a crucial factor, it is called Dwayne Johnson ""The Rock."" There is nothing wrong with him, I am really neutral about him regarding his movies, but, if you pay attention to some of his roles in other movies, he is a perfect candidate for a movie with a bunch of special effects and destruction everywhere, for example, San Andreas, not for a racing movie. But it does not finish there, they decide to put Jason Statham as the antagonist, but at least he had some relation with races in Death Race!

I am not saying that the director, Justin Lin, did a bad job. On the contrary, he did a great job leading the saga to a broader action scape, but I would not recommend this film to a person who has watched the first one for the same reason, for the concept of tunning cars, racing, and live life in a different way, a little bit faster. The characters also did a great job, Mark Sinclair Vincent (Vin Diesel) and Paul Walker are excellent for this movie, but it is the direction that it took that made the film forget about its real origins and lose some of those fans who enjoyed more a sound of an engine rather than a car flying to the moon as in the last movie.",argeniscastro-02897,2024-03-10,2024
12,6.0,Totally different approach.,"""Fast Five,"" the fifth installment in the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, takes a sharp turn from its predecessors, emphasizing heist over high-speed chases, which might not sit well with all fans. Known for its adrenaline-pumping car scenes, this entry opts for a more plot-driven, action-heist approach, focusing deeply on the criminal undertakings of Dom Toretto and his crew as they navigate the dangerous streets of Rio de Janeiro.While the shift towards a more narrative-heavy, business-like focus on organized crime marks a significant departure from the street racing roots of the series, it opens up a new dimension to the characters. We see them not just as racers but as full-fledged heist specialists, expanding the franchise's appeal but at the risk of alienating its core audience who loved the car-centric ethos.One cannot discuss ""Fast Five"" without noting its intense action sequences. The film pushes the envelope with set pieces that include dragging a massive bank vault through busy city streets, defying the laws of physics in ways that can only be described as outlandish yet entertaining. This emphasis on spectacle over realism might draw criticism for being too over-the-top, but it also adds a unique flavor of thrill that's hard to find elsewhere.Amidst the action, the film does not forget its roots in family and brotherhood, themes that have tethered the franchise together since the beginning. Dom's unwavering dedication to his family, and his ability to weave these values into the crew's dynamic, provides an emotional anchor amid the chaos. It reinforces the bond between the characters, giving depth to their interactions and motivations beyond mere monetary gains.Overall, ""Fast Five"" represents a bold evolution in the series, steering away from pure street racing to embrace a broader heist thriller aspect. While this might disappoint some long-time fans, it also reinvigorates the franchise with fresh energy and a more expansive storyline. The blend of action and character-driven narrative earns ""Fast Five"" a solid 6 out of 10, acknowledging both its departures and its daring endeavors in storytelling.",schmittfalte,2024-04-21,2024

93,9.0,100% adrenaline,"""Fast Five"" is so far the best in the franchise with a big gap. In this film you really see the idea of bringing the saga to be an automotive action franchise, and it does it great. This film brings together the main characters of the franchise in an exceptional way and the links between them work perfectly. I really liked the in-depth introduction by Elena, Hobbs and the greater involvement of Gisele. The plot of this film has entertained me a lot and I think for the most part thanks to the beautiful Brazilian setting. The soundtracks of the film are perfect for both the environment and the various moments of the film. It's very good plot writing and how the various characters get involved in the shot and the costumes are perfect for the setting. Lin's direction confirms or even exceeds the excellent work done with the previous 2 films. In my opinion, Vin Diesel plays his character better and better, Paul Walker is a great actor, I liked the performances of Nelsa Pataky and Dwayne Johnson. Gal Gadot confirms herself as a great actress and plays Gisele very well. I love the Roman-Tej couple, especially for their actors, Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris, perfect for the role. The hilarious Tego Leo-Santos pair also works perfectly. I also liked the return of Vince, which works well with writing. The ending of the film is spectacular with an incredible soundtrack, I love it, I really enjoy it. The mid-credit is incredibly adrenaline, leaves you speechless. I can't wait to see the sixth film from one of the most spectacular and underrated sagas in film history..

36,9.0,A flawless Fast & Furious film!,"The fifth installment in the Fast & Furious franchise perfects the formula in what many consider to be the best entry in the series. Picking right up where the previous film left off, Fast Five is balls to the wall action from the opening shot. An over arching heist plot is the perfect premise for the franchise at the time, keeping it simple while giving it flexibility to continue flying above the shark.The Rock slips into the series seamlessly, harnessing aspects of his wrestling persona into a great performance as Hobbs. He is a refreshing antagonist for being a brutish law enforcer type instead of the usual street gang leader. The Family is in prime form in this film, bringing back past characters for THE high-stakes heist.",mediatation,2024-06-21,2024
24,7.0,Fast Five - Jamison Slabaugh,Another thrilling roller coaster ride as per usual for The Fast & Furious franchise. The cinematography as usual is at an all time high for this film. The plot in this film while it is no longer about racing has the most depth and the most twists and turns in them. Seeing Brian and Dom as brothers in this film was a full circle moment and worked well throughout the film. Having Vince return in this film was a great decision as well. His death hits the audience in a smaller way than most deaths do but still worked effectively. The pacing in this film is a huge step up from the past four films. The action in this film and the tension build up works great. Seeing Dom build his own crew was really cool as we got to see the return of every major player from the past four films. Me personally seeing the return of Roman Pierce was absolutely hilarious. Mia being pregnant was an obvious twist but was awesome in the sense that it gave Brian and Mia the ending they wanted in this film. Dom similarly as he was able to finally stop running and be free. Hobbs' motives and decision to start hunting Dom and Brian again at the end of the film feels very weak. He just helped pull of a heist that was illegal and now he wants to go back to hunting them. Feels like weak writing. The antagonist like usual is very basic and again doesn't have very much depth. He does get a few scenes explaining how power over other people works but other than that nothing. This is how the best antagonist that we have gotten in The Fast & Furious franchise. 7/10 STARS.,jamisonslabaugh,2024-07-07,2024
34,9.0,I'm shocked by how good this is.,"I would like to formally apologize for giving this a rating of 3/5 six years ago. It was the only Fast and Furious movie I'd seen at that point, and I thought it was just disposable, stupid fun... but also kind of boring in places. Watching it after getting through the previous four movies in order... this one is close to amazing. I can't lie. It brings together all the main supporting and lead characters from the past four in such a fun way. They really do feel like a ""family"" (I know about the memes, but it feels genuine here).Throughout this watch-through of the series, seeing most for the first time, I was anticipating the point when the series cast aside car races and became action schlock, and now, it's clear that Fast Five is the point where that transition happens. And what wonderful, stupid, mindless, entertaining schlock it is. So comically macho, so over-the-top, so consistently devoid of anything boring. There's a part of my brain that rejects the stupidity, but most of my brain doesn't care, and just submits. I sort of loved this one. An action movie classic. Non-stop, dopey, and kind of self-aware without being cloying or overdone about it. Vin Diesel, who I've called a charisma vacuum before... I liked him here. He was perfectly utilized. Seeing everyone else come back was great. The new characters were generally fun (especially The (Sweaty) Rock). Shifting away from car racing and turning this whole thing into a ridiculous heist movie was such a good move.I get the hype, now. Watching this one out of context a while back, it felt like a passable movie, but seeing the series build towards this - following it all along the way - was shockingly satisfying. I believe this one's considered the high point of the series, and that's okay with me. This is a ridiculously fun movie. It's shallow as hell and not particularly clever, but it delivers meaty fun, rarely subjects you to a dull moment, and has a handful of incredible action sequences (the one in the opening and then the climax are the two best from the series so far). This is, for the most part, awesome. And I can't believe I'm saying that. I get it!",Jeremy_Urquhart,2024-07-27,2024

The film features a host of memorable moments, with the safe-dragging heist through the streets of Rio de Janeiro becoming one of the most iconic action scenes in modern cinema.What sets Fast Five apart is its ability to balance character-driven moments with jaw-dropping action. The chemistry between the cast, especially the growing camaraderie among Toretto's crew, gives the movie heart. The stakes feel higher, the scale is grander, and the film blends humor, spectacle, and intensity in near-perfect harmony.Overall, Fast Five is an absolute blast from start to finish and is one of the best entries in the Fast & Furious franchise.

11,7.0,"The beginning, and end, of the genuinely good films in this franchise.","Fast Five rides the line between ridiculous and fun better than any other Fast movie.

I've been disillusioned to his acting talents recently, but here he's firing on all cylinders with a role perfect for him.We also have a few returning characters, creating a well rounded roster overall and building upon the previous films. With this we also have a fresh and exciting location: Pseudo-Brazil.Now you still have to throw out any prior knowledge of physics to enjoy the film. Fast Five also requires any geopolitical facts to be purged in order to make a semblance of sense. After that, you're good.This film is absolutely the direction they needed to go.

53,10.0,ACTION PACKED AND CHARACTER DYNAMICS,"Fast & Furious 5 reveiw in 700 words Fast Five, released in 2011 and directed by Justin Lin, is the fifth instalment in the Fast & Furious franchise. This film marks a significant turning point for the series, shifting from street racing to a more heist-oriented action adventure, which ultimately breathes new life into the franchise.

The movie kicks off with Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) being broken out of a prison transport by his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) and his best friend Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker). The trio escapes to Rio de Janeiro, where they reunite with Vince (Matt Schulze) from the first film. In Rio, they get involved in a high-stakes job that goes south, catching the attention of U. S. Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson). Hobbs is determined to capture Dom and his team, while the crew plans a massive heist to steal $100 million from corrupt businessman Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida).

Key Points:

Action-Packed Sequences: Fast Five is packed with high-octane action scenes, including elaborate heists, intense car chases, and explosive confrontations. The standout set piece is the thrilling bank vault heist through the streets of Rio, showcasing the film's blend of practical stunts and CGI.

Character Dynamics: The movie brings together key characters from previous instalments, creating a ""family"" dynamic that becomes a central theme of the series. Dom, Brian, and Mia are joined by characters like Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Han (Sung Kang), Gisele (Gal Gadot), and more, forming a diverse and charismatic ensemble cast.

Dwayne Johnson's Role: One of the film's major highlights is the introduction of Dwayne Johnson as Luke Hobbs. Johnson's imposing presence and charisma add a new dimension to the film, and his clashes with Vin Diesel's Dom provide some of the movie's most intense and memorable moments.

Setting: The vibrant and visually stunning backdrop of Rio de Janeiro adds to the film's appeal. The city's favelas and iconic landmarks are used effectively, contributing to the overall excitement and authenticity of the action scenes.

Critiques:

Shift in Tone: While the transition from street racing to heist action broadened the series' appeal, some long-time fans might miss the original focus on underground racing culture. The new direction, however, was generally well-received and revitalized the franchise.

Plot and Logic: The film's plot can be over-the-top and occasionally defies logic, especially during the more outrageous stunts. However, these elements are part of what makes the film enjoyable for many viewers-it's about embracing the spectacle and fun of it all.

Themes:

Family: A recurring theme in Fast Five is the importance of family. The camaraderie and loyalty among Dom's crew are emphasized throughout the film, reinforcing the idea that they are a family bound by more than just blood.

Redemption and Trust: Characters like Dom and Brian seek redemption for their past actions. Trust is also a central theme, as the crew must rely on each other to pull off their elaborate heist and evade capture.

Overall Assessment:

Fast Five successfully redefines the Fast & Furious series, propelling it into a new direction that balances character-driven moments with high-octane action. The film's mix of thrilling heists, memorable characters, and impressive stunts ensures that it stands out as a high point in the franchise.

Fast Five, directed by Justin Lin, is the fifth installment in the Fast and Furious franchise. Released in 2011, the film brings together a talented ensemble cast, including Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson.

The story takes place after the events of Fast & Furious (2009). Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is on the run after being busted out of a prison transport bus. Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), an FBI agent, is tasked with capturing Toretto. However, the two eventually team up to take down a corrupt businessman, Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), who is using Rio de Janeiro as a hub for his illegal activities.

Fast Five is an adrenaline-fueled action film that delivers on its promise of high-octane thrills. The movie features impressive car chases, intense hand-to-hand combat sequences, and a show-stopping heist scene that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

The film's cast is excellent, with Diesel and Walker delivering solid performances as the lead characters. The chemistry between the two is undeniable, and their banter adds a layer of humor to the film.

57,10.0,Thrilling fast 5🔥,"Fast Five is a high-octane action film that serves as the fifth installment in the popular Fast and Furious franchise. Directed by Justin Lin and released in 2011, the film continues the story of Dominic Toretto (played by Vin Diesel) and his street racing crew, who have evolved from simple racers to international thieves. The film's storyline is a thrilling mix of action, heists, and car chases, with a healthy dose of humor and camaraderie among the characters.

The plot of Fast Five revolves around Dom and his crew, which includes Brian O'Conner (played by Paul Walker), Letty Ortiz (played by Michelle Rodriguez), Han Seoul-Oh (played by Sung Kang), and newcomer Gisele Yashar (played by Gal Gadot). The crew is living off the grid in Brazil after being framed for a heist in the previous film, Fast Four. They learn of a plan to steal $100 million from corrupt DEA agent Luke Hobbs (played by Dwayne Johnson), and they decide to take on the job in order to clear their names and set themselves up for the future.

The heist is a complex and well-executed plan that involves breaking into a heavily guarded vault, stealing a variety of cars, and making a daring escape through the streets of Rio de Janeiro. The action sequences in Fast Five are some of the best in the franchise, with breathtaking car chases, high-speed pursuits, and a spectacular bus-crashing finale. The film's stunt work and practical effects are impressive, and the use of real cars adds a level of authenticity to the action that is often lacking in other action films.

One of the most notable aspects of Fast Five is its characters and the chemistry between the cast members. The return of Han, who was presumed dead in the third film, adds a layer of emotional depth to the story, as Dom's relationships with his crew members are tested throughout the film. The introduction of Gisele and the development of her bond with Brian add new dimensions to the characters, and the dynamic between Dom and Brian is further explored as they navigate their roles as fathers and partners.

The film also features a return to the franchise's roots as a street racing movie, with several high-stakes races that showcase the skills of the various characters. These races serve as both a way to showcase the impressive car modifications and the sheer skill of the drivers, as well as a means of building tension and excitement throughout the film.

Justin Lin's direction in Fast Five is aggressive and stylish, with an emphasis on speed and movement that keeps the film moving at a breakneck pace. The film's editing is sharp and precise, with quick cuts and tight shots that keep the audience engaged and on the edge of their seats. The cinematography is also noteworthy, with the stunning locations of Rio de Janeiro and the beautiful cars serving as a visual feast for.",nathantinashemugwadi,2024-12-17,2024

75,10.0,A thriller,"What a film. Keeps you on the edge. This is the film that single-handedly got me to give the rest of the series a shot, for better or worse. The scene is beautiful. The actors were brilliant. The suspense, was of just the right dose. Keeps you on the edge and cals you at the same time. I could not ask for more. T's a nice change of pace from the previous films where it abandons the street race angle and goes into the direction of a heist action flick with cars. So yeah, still the best this franchise had, and that's kind of rare for a franchise on its fifth film. The action for the most part is really handled well and a lot of fun to watch. The cast as an ensemble are very charismatic which no doubt makes it more fun for audiences to see a cast that has so much diversity and it's not done with generic stereotypes but just a bunch of people with a common interest.

45,4.0,If you like low quality ridiculous action go right ahead,"It's ASTONISHING any of these films beyond #3 have a rating higher than 6. It's another series that lost its way and became a shameless cash grab after the 3rd film. Every other series that does this ends up in the 4s, but somehow this is over 7!Literally 10 minutes into this and already I've seen two scenes that were funny bad. The first scene features a giant American bus crashing at speed sideways into a 1960s muscle car. No I'm joking; that would of course have been BORING, so instead it BOUNCED off the 1960s muscle car and flew over the top into a spectacular rolling motion, leaving the 60s car unscathed. Of course, everyone on the bus walked away from this monumental rolling crash in an old bus with no safety features without a scratch as well. Would never happen in real life doesn't cut it - it's laughably ridiculous. I can't watch stuff like this, it's beneath me. I'd be embarrassed to say I was a fan of this. Do people seriously watch this in the cinema with a smile, wowed by how cool and exciting it was?? Very shortly after this, we see an unfathomably dangerous jump from a train to a car (a now a trope of these films). Spectacular enough you'd think right? Well the writers of this film didn't think so, because they had the two guys drive off a huge cliff at speed immediately afterwards and about 3 seconds after their bodies hit the water at what must have been over 100mph, they came up as if they'd just jumped into a kids pool. Even if I could be bothered with the otherwise average film, these scenes make me get to the end of it thinking I just set fire to 2 hours of my life. It's actually so boring to watch such preposterous nonsense and makes me care less about the rest of it. This is similar writing/production quality and effort as fake TikTok pranks. And by the way, I've only scratched the surface. Half the scenes there's something stupid about it.And what they've done to this series is especially infuriating because the first few are some of the most iconic films to me. They are probably the best look into street racing culture of any films with good car action, good stories, good characters, good acting, good music. There was no need to turn them into generic low quality action movies. But actually what's most infuriating is that these films grew and grew in popularity after they lowered the quality and removed the identity and even got better ratings on IMDB. Any other series and they're in the 4s when they start becoming this low quality. I can't deny as a business they did a great job, but from an artistic, filmmaking and cultural perspective the series is deeeaaaad by this film.All that said, if you like low quality generic action films with this vibe and are quite happy to watch regular people in supposedly the real world do things such as fall from outer space into an active volcano and then climb out 3 seconds later without a bead of sweat these will probably be worth watching.The only things I can genuinely praise are the camerawork and sets and some of the non-action scenes are decent. And I will say they get worse with each one after 3. 4 is decent, 5 is trash, 6 is trash, 7 is a crime against humanity. I have no plans to lose any more brain cells with any newer ones.",blightersaurus,2024-12-18,2024

106,10.0,Fast and furious review,"Fast Five isn't just a movie-it's a full-throttle spectacle that redefines what an action film can be. Directed by Justin Lin, this fifth installment in the Fast & Furious franchise shifts gears from street racing to a heist-centered adventure, delivering an adrenaline-fueled experience that leaves audiences breathless.

The story picks up with Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) on the run, assembling an elite crew to pull off a daring $100 million heist in Rio de Janeiro. While evading both a ruthless drug lord and a relentless federal agent, Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), the film blends action, loyalty, and family into a gripping narrative.

What sets Fast Five apart is its perfect balance of breakneck action and emotional stakes. Every car chase, fistfight, and explosive stunt is grounded in the bond between the characters, making the audience care about their fate.

Fast Five takes action to a whole new level. The now-iconic vault heist scene through the streets of Rio is a masterclass in creativity and chaos. Watching two cars drag a massive steel vault at high speeds through the city is jaw-dropping-pure blockbuster magic. The film's practical stunts and minimal reliance on CGI make the action sequences feel raw, authentic, and utterly thrilling.

The addition of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as Luke Hobbs injects fresh energy into the franchise. His larger-than-life presence and intense rivalry with Dominic Toretto lead to one of the best hand-to-hand combat scenes in recent action cinema. The chemistry between the returning cast-Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, and Tyrese Gibson-adds humor, camaraderie, and heart, reminding fans why they've stuck with the series.

The vibrant streets of Rio serve as more than just a backdrop-they become a character in their own right. From sun-drenched favelas to sprawling highways, the setting adds a gritty, exotic flavor to the film, elevating its visual appeal.

Fast Five is the turning point where the franchise evolved from a series about underground racing to a global action phenomenon. It set the tone for future installments, combining heist elements, elaborate stunts, and a focus on family. Fans of movies like Ocean's Eleven and The Italian Job will love the clever planning and teamwork on display.

While the film is nearly flawless as a blockbuster, some might find its over-the-top moments bordering on implausible. But let's be honest: Fast Five isn't about realism-it's about delivering a high-octane thrill ride, and it succeeds spectacularly.

Fast Five is a game-changer that raises the bar for action films. With jaw-dropping stunts, a stellar cast, and an unforgettable heist, it's more than just a movie-it's an experience. Whether you're a long-time fan of the franchise or a newcomer, buckle up and get ready for the ride of a lifetime.",hovemavy,2024-12-19,2024
69,10.0,Got me to put more intrest in the whole series,"This is the film that single-handedly got me to give the rest of the series a shot, for better or worse. It's a nice change of pace from the previous films where it abandons the street race angle (how far could you have taken that anyway?) and goes into the direction of a heist action flick with cars. Dwayne Johnson is a great addition and really adds to the series embracing the goofiness of its premise. So yeah, still the best this franchise had, and that's kind of rare for a franchise on its fifth film. The action for the most part is really handled well and a lot of fun to watch. The cast as an ensemble are very charismatic which no doubt makes it more fun for audiences to see a cast that has so much diversity and it's not done with generic stereotypes but just a bunch of people with a common interest. Overall a very entertaining action flick.

Final Verdict: So far the best and most entertaining film of this series.",tcsuvo-54512,2024-12-19,2024

110,7.0,A Thrilling Evolution of the Franchise with Some Room for Improvement,"Fast Five marks a pivotal moment in the Fast & Furious franchise, shifting gears from street racing to high-stakes heist action, and it largely succeeds in reimagining the series' direction. The film brings together a star-studded ensemble, with Vin Diesel and Paul Walker reprising their roles, and introducing Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, whose presence adds a much-needed boost of energy and charisma to the team. The chemistry between the characters is strong, and the action sequences are as adrenaline-fueled as ever-especially the jaw-dropping heist at the heart of the plot.The film also benefits from a tighter, more focused narrative compared to some of its predecessors, as it moves away from the street-racing subculture and dives into heist territory. The set pieces are grand and well-executed, including the memorable scene where a massive vault is dragged through the streets of Rio. It's the kind of spectacle that makes Fast Five an undeniably fun ride for fans of action films.However, while the action is top-notch, the film's plot can feel a bit formulaic, and some of the character motivations are glossed over in favor of the spectacle. Certain elements-like the improbable stunts and the occasional cheesy dialogue-pull it back from being a truly great film. Additionally, while the ensemble cast is a strength, the sheer number of characters can sometimes dilute the emotional stakes of the story.Overall, Fast Five is a significant improvement over its predecessors, bringing a fresh dynamic to the franchise that pays off in terms of excitement and entertainment. While it's not without its flaws, it manages to be an engaging and fun ride that propels the Fast & Furious saga into new territory, setting the stage for even bigger and bolder adventures.",fahimrcs,2025-01-17,2025
192,6.0,This one depends on what you are looking for,"I was wondering when I would when the point where I think the movies should have stopped. For me, this is it. At this point the plot felt more like a Soap Opera in the sense that the plot was getting drug out far longer than it should be. What made this movie worse for me was the way they set up the return of some great characters, but then they seemed to abandon that storyline entirely for more scenes with Vin fighting the Rock or racing Paul Walker. This had so much potential being set in Rio and even ending in a heist, but they didn't even do that well. I had this rated as a 4 at first, but I had to give it an extra point considering the expectations of anyone actually watching this movie. Given the audience the audience and expectations, I suppose it met them, but nothing was exceeded. This fact is made even more disappointing by the budget they had for this movie I'm sure. Okay, this movie earned yet another star at the end, but I won't say why. I'm still surprised to see so many rating this as the best of the Franchise, I wouldn't agree with that, but I'm looking for more than Action in a movie.",jaredlemin,2025-01-30,2025
470,10.0,"The Return of Muscle, Schemes, and Screaming Tires","Dom and his crew of illegal mechanics are back in full force. You'd think after four movies, these guys would be pimping out walkers in a retirement home, but nope-they're taking over Brazil with more sweat than a wrestling match and more roaring engines than an episode of Dragon Ball Z. It's beautiful, it's brutal, and thank God there's enough popcorn to survive the ride.Dwayne Johnson's arrival in the franchise is like adding a hacked DLC to GTA. This guy is a walking wall, a beast hunting down Dom and his crew with the finesse of a jackhammer. The Vin Diesel vs. Dwayne Johnson fight? It's less of a regular brawl and more like Godzilla vs. King Kong. The result? You're glued to your seat, holding your breath, and begging for more.Fast & Furious 5 is where logic gets put on airplane mode and physics gets kicked out like it failed its high school exams. A scene where two cars drag a massive bank vault through the streets of Rio? Not only does it happen, but it's shot so intensely you'll almost want to try it with your own Clio and a public trash bin. Spoiler: It won't work.The movie sticks to its roots: stunning women, illegal street races, and soap-opera-level one-liners. Jordana Brewster is still there to remind Dom that he's human (even though he looks like the Terminator), and Elsa Pataky brings just enough charm to balance out all the testosterone-fueled chaos.The plot? It's not exactly Les Misérables. You're here to watch cars blow up, bad guys get wrecked, and cheap betrayals spice things up. Justin Lin knows that subtlety is for arthouse films-here, we want visuals that slap and testosterone that drips off the screen.Fast & Furious 5 is unapologetic blockbuster entertainment. It doesn't aim to be smart; it aims to blow your mind, and damn, it does just that. Between Dwayne Johnson smashing everything, Vin Diesel growling like a bear, and car chases that defy Newton's laws, you'll leave the theater with an irresistible urge to buy a car and install neon lights under the chassis.",OniFR,2025-02-07,2025
488,9.0,Fast Five: Revving Up the Franchise to a New Level,"Fast Five is a shot of pure adrenaline straight to the heart of the Fast and Furious franchise. This 2011 installment doesn't just get the engine running again; it throws it into hyperdrive. It's the first film of the 2010s where proportion of the franchise to truly capture the spirit of the early films while simultaneously forging its own path, and arguably stands as the best since the initial The Fast and the Furious and 2 Fast 2 Furious.The franchise has always been about action, but Fast Five cranks it up to 11. From the incredible highway heist that kicks things off to the jaw-dropping safe drag at the film's climax, the action is bigger, bolder, and more inventive than anything we'd seen before. But what elevates Fast Five above mere spectacle is that it doesn't sacrifice story for the explosions. Instead, it crafts a truly compelling narrative that we can buy into, driven by stakes we understand, and characters we've invested in for a decade.The return of familiar faces like Tej (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) and Roman (Tyrese Gibson) is a welcome addition, bringing back some of the playful banter and camaraderie that was sorely missed. And then there's the introduction of Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) - (And one of my two Non-Toretto Crew related characters of the series) - a character that immediately steals every scene he's in. His raw power and unwavering dedication to the law are a fantastic foil to Dom (Vin Diesel) and the crew. This, alongside the entrance of Elena (Elsa Pataky), a local officer who gets caught in the criminal cross hairs, adds a completely fresh dynamic. Elena's interactions with Dom build a captivating and intriguing relationship that adds another layer of depth.Mia's pregnancy adds an emotional undercurrent to the high-octane action, while the decision to set the film in the vibrant, sun-soaked streets of Rio de Janeiro provides a stunning new backdrop. The villain, Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), is a genuinely credible threat, a corrupt businessman with far-reaching power, making the stakes feel higher than ever. The masterstroke here is the seamless weaving together of characters from previous films, making this feel like a culmination of the franchise's journey so far, and a true ensemble movie. It was also a brilliant move to play with the established lore of the franchise.And that ending, the reveal that Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) was alive the whole time, is a masterclass in cliffhanger storytelling. It ignites a fire of badass anticipation, setting the stage for even grander things to come.Fast Five isn't just a great action movie; it's a defining moment for the franchise. It finds the perfect balance between over-the-top absurdity and genuine heart, cementing its place as one of the best of the series. This movie understands what makes the Fast saga so exciting, and it delivers on all fronts. It's a thrill ride that leaves you breathless, satisfied, and desperately wanting more. For all these reasons, Fast Five earns a well-deserved 9/10.",douglasc11,2025-01-05,2025
