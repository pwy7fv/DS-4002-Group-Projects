0,8.0,"""This is vehicular warfare.""","I don't think many other franchises has been as turbulent and uneven as The Fast and the Furious films. Things started off pretty earnestly with Rob Cohen's first film, but quickly careened into odd directions, with the ever-cheesy 2 Fast 2 Furious taking off and running with one main character while leaving the other in the dust, and with Tokyo Drift drifting away with totally different characters altogether. Thankfully, Fast & Furious realigned the series with its roots. But it wasn't until Fast Five when I really began to give a darn about this series. Granted that all films have had their fun moments, the fifth film magically tied in every single strand from every single film, and made every single character relevant. Best of all, it did so with a great sense of fun: it had great pacing, amusing comedy, great action, and it made the characters stand out as a collectively outstanding cast.So now Fast & Furious 6 has come out, reuniting the entire gang once more to take on bigger stakes. The spectacle in this film tries its best to be even bigger, more absurd, and more awesome than before: the film is effectively book-ended with two massive action setpieces. The first involves a decently destructive car chase in London, where the villain effectively uses his custom-built ride to launch other cars all over the place. The film's final act features a really crazy sequence in which a tank roars across a highway, crushing other cars and blowing up bridges. This all culminates with all the muscle cars banding together to bring down a massive cargo plane in a fiery blaze of glory. In between, the film slows down a bit, but there's frequent fist-fights and pursuits, a few scenes of witty comedy, and there's one decent car-racing scene.Whether or not you really dig this film may depend on how well you dig the characters and all their dynamics. It definitely helps to watch and understand the events of the first five films, because at this point, they've all been through so much and changed so much; for a late-comer like me, who never was invested in the characters until the last film, it can be confusing to remember who was who and what their history was. Fortunately, the film does insert some flashbacks and reminders for the audience's benefit. If you are keeping up with things, then the film will reward you with a cast of endearing and heartfelt characters, and the film's plot generally revolves around their continuing struggles. As far as the actual plot goes, it's pretty brainless and absurd action-movie fodder, and there are plot holes to be found. However, the film does have the merit of presenting a cast of villains to directly oppose the cast of heroes, and the story pulls out a few surprising twists.The film generally looks good, but many of the action scenes are hectically shot and edited, and it can be hard to tell what's going on in certain scenes. What you can see is awesome, but sometimes, it's just aggravating. Acting is generally fun and enjoyable from the whole cast. Writing gets the job done well enough. This production uses a plethora of quality sets, props, and costumes, with loads of flashy cars at its disposal, and some okay-looking special effects. This film uses some cool hip rap and techno music, while the music score is pretty cool (sounds a lot like Brian Tyler's work from Tokyo Drift, which was one of my favorite soundtracks).Best recommended to fans of the series, especially if you've been following the last few movies.4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)",Al_The_Strange,2013-05-24,2013
1,8.0,A big movie and a fun time!,"Well, this was unexpected! Going into this film I found myself with no hype at all. I expected a good, fun and cheesy movie time and I came out of the theater happy and surprised. While this isn't a masterpiece of filmmaking it does achieve what it sets out to do. To entertain you. And it does this quite good and sometimes it goes further than this by showing us some amazing set pieces and action sequences. For example one car, tank chase sequence! This is achieved by the gigantic production value of the film. You can literally smell the money that comes out of these guys. The whole movie you have this sense of scale, and I mean BIG scale! The amazing sound mixing and design including the music pumps you up and puts you in the mood! While the acting isn't Oscar worthy it is very fluid and it doesn't always feel forced. The chemistry between the cast is very solid and credible. Diesel and ""The Rock"" where pretty solid along with the secondary characters, and the villain was surprisingly tolerable. Another thing that solidifies the movie are the effects. These are outstanding along with the camera-work! The things that brought the movie down for me a little bit where some of the stunts, and weirdly some of these I found pretty amazing but although I understand this movie isn't supposed to be taken seriously there were some stunts that were just plain unbelievable, specially in the third act of the movie. And finally, the plot. While not groundbreaking it did have its interesting points but it doesn't drift away from the cheese factors. Overall I was quite surprised by what this movie did and how the director and producers exploited and used their huge production value. This is an example of a good quality action flick.",pablo2896,2013-05-24,2013
4,7.0,Movin' on up!,"While most franchises lose their steam with each succeeding sequel, the Fast and the Furious franchise is that rare exception where its later films breathe in new life into the series. Once a franchise about car racing, ""Fast Five"" took an unexpected turn as a bank heist thriller in the vein of Steven Soderbergh's ""Ocean's 11,"" a welcomed change as seen by its huge box office earnings and critical success. Now, ""Furious 6"" is neither about car racing nor bank heists, but rather a terrorist threat with obvious inspirations from ""The Dark Knight."" Like ""Fast Five,"" the results are immensely satisfying and undeniably entertaining.The key to the franchise's upward turn in quality is due to director Justin Lin. He is a skilled action director, and many filmmakers can learn a few things or two from him: The action sequences are impressive, engaging, comprehensible, and well-shot, with practical effects to boot. There is a sense of danger, verve, and life in these scenes rarely found in other films, despite how over-the-top and ridiculous they may be; and yes, they often drift into gratify-defying territory. While I usually don't react out loudly when watching a film, this film had me gasping, jaw dropping, laughing, and applauding, sometimes all at once!Another ingredient to the film's success is the chemistry between the cast members. We have grown to love these characters over the course of the series that one cannot help but cheer on for them. In particular, Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous have such a terrific rapport with each other that they provide some of the film's biggest laughs and memorable one-liners. Additionally, Luke Evans is definitely a step up above the previous film's antagonist, and Gina Carano provides some great ass-kicking moments, although not much performance-wise. On another note, I want to mention how refreshing it is to see minority actors fill these roles. Certainly, the film's use of a diverse ensemble cast should be commended. As for the story, it's nothing special, but I dare you not to act surprised when several plot twists are revealed; I did so more than I would like to admit.If there's one thing to learn about this franchise, it's that some change can be a good thing. While the later sequels do focus away from the car racing, they still featured cars, which helped retain old fans while bringing in new ones. ""Furious 6"" is terrific entertainment, and judging by yet another dazzling cliffhanger and the audience's reaction, ""Fast & Furious 7"" will be an amazing finale for the series. Unfortunately, Justin Lin won't be back around for the last installment, but someone please get this man to direct every and all upcoming action flicks.",moviewizguy,2013-05-16,2013
6,7.0,"As if a Tank wasn't enough, they got a Plane too","Fast & Furious over the last few installments has become all about action. And the latest outing takes it a step further. Almost 20% of the movie is comprised of action sequences. And at the expense of action, plot, writing, characters all take a backseat. But no one's complaining. Why ? Because the action makes up for all of it.Do the above statements sound cliché ??? The movie's plot is full of such silly dialogs so its best ignored in the current context. What works is the action - Lin and his crew bring us some of the most ridiculously outrageous and boldly conceived action sequences. There's an intense chase through London in the initial reels and also a race later on. There's a whole plane take-off-crash sequence towards the end that you've probably got a glimpse of in the trailers. The girls are no slouches either and we see an intense hand-to-hand fight of sorts between Michelle Rodriguez's Letty and Gina Carano's Riley.But the movie's best sequence is undoubtedly the 10 minute Tank chase across the freeway that involves most of the cast and culminates in a breathtaking ""catch"" (about which I'd not say any further). The camera cuts like crazy, music is pulsating and that single sequence is probably worth the price of the movie ticket.Apart from action, Furious 6 doesn't have much going for it. Dialog is standard, at times even silly and predictable, characters are flat, performances are decent. The car chases and night scenes got me so involved, I actually felt a bit strange leaving the theater and coming out into the real world's broad daylight. And the post-credits scene is simply, a treat which makes the next installment in the series worth looking forward to. Suffice it to say that in the end, the movie drifts full circle.Watch it for the action, and for the action alone. If you expect any sort of character development or family issues like the first installment had, you'll be disappointed. Else, you're in for one hell of a ride.Score: 7 / 10",KrazzyDJ,2013-05-26,2013
8,6.0,Indeed a guy's movie...,"The faster the cars in this franchise seem to go, the more realism seems to go away with it. Sure, the action and car chases in ""Fast & Furious 6"" is breathtaking and spectacular, but the movie was just a tad over the top.I sat down to watch ""Fast & Furious 6"" simply because I had the opportunity, and because I wanted to watch it because of Michelle Rodriguez. I can't say that I had any particular hopes or expectations to this movie, nor can I claim that it was a movie release that I was in any way looking forward to.If you have seen any of the previous five movies then you know exactly what you will get here. There is nothing much new to be had here, it is essentially the same. However, that being said, then the movie is enjoyable, entertaining and fast-paced.This sixth installment to the franchise brings the return of an assumed dead member of the Toretto 'family' and it also brings the departure of one. The returning member is, of course, Letty. I am not going to reveal who will be departing - you'll just have to watch the movie for yourself and find out.As entertaining as the action was in the movie, then the last whole segment was a bit too much. I mean, a car bring down a massive Russian cargo airplane? That was just too much. And how long does it take for a plane of that size to get enough speed to become airborne? It just took forever. And speaking of forever, then that tarmac runway had to be the longest in the world - it just went on and on.As with the previous movies, then it is a great ensemble of actors and actresses, and it is as always a joy to have them returning to their parts, and there is a great chemistry between the various characters. I was especially thrilled to see Joe Taslim (playing Jah) in the movie; he did a great job in ""The Raid: Redemption"" and its great to see him make it into American cinema as well. He is definitely a guy to keep an eye on in the future.""Fast & Furious 6"" is, as the previous five movies, a guy's movie - full of adrenaline, muscle cars, car chases, macho guys and testosterone dripping off everywhere. The story was enjoyable, even with the part that went off the scale. And if you enjoyed any of the previous movies, then you definitely want to watch ""Fast & Furious 6"" as well.",paul_haakonsen,2013-09-01,2013
9,9.0,"Hail, hail the gang's all here - but now minus one","Mixed emotions his the viewer seeing FAST AND FURIOUS 6 for the first time knowing that Paul Walker is gone and wondering what will happen with the in process Fast and Furious 7. But in ways that fact makes this movie more treasured. It is a whoop-'em up fast action packed film that takes your breath away with the wild car chases and one the ground derring- do. Writer Chris Morgan and director Justin Lin have this medium down to a predictable but fine science.The plot is fairly simple (as usual) allowing the telling of the story to be more important than any big philosophical notions. Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson, with even larger biceps varices!) has Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) reassemble their crew (Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Sung Kang) in order to take down mastermind Shaw (Luke Evans) who commands an organization of mercenary drivers across 12 countries. Payment? Full pardons for them all. The big driver is to 'rescue' Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who seems to be with Shaw's group after suffering amnesia, back into their fold. Wild situations abound and they are as exciting as ever – if not more so!Definitely worth watching even for those who are not long term F & F fans. It is a terrific action film with sparkling actors having a great time. Grady Harp December 13",gradyharp,2013-12-12,2013
10,7.0,12 years after the first outing and the franchise is unrecognisable - which is a good thing,"The Fast and Furious franchise has undergone a radical transformation since launching 12 years ago, with the changes following Justin Lin taking hold of directorial duties from Tokyo Drift (film three) onwards.The series has made the transition from street races to include drugs, heists, and now terrorism, while lead characters Dom Toretto (Diesel) and Brian O'Conner (Walker) have gone from petty thug and law enforcer to wanted fugitives.With an opening sequence reminiscent of Quantum of Solace, Toretto and Brian screech around mountaintops as the latter readies himself to become a father, demonstrating how adult and family-minded they've become. Meanwhile, what follows is a nice refresher for those acquainted with the series and for newcomers alike, acting as a highlights reel to bring everyone up to speed of the events experienced in the previous five films.The antagonist for Fast 6 is Mr Owen Shaw (Evans), a former special ops military man that uses his knowledge, contacts and fast cars to make robberies for the highest bidder. In this instance, it just so happens he has his eyes on a chip that would incite terrorism in the wrong hands, which prompts baby oil-loving federal agent Hobbs (Johnson) to round up Toretto and his crew for back-up, offering them full pardons in exchange for their services.London is the main backdrop for the film, which, naturally, features a very corny cameo, though the the bright lights, black taxis and double-decker buses dotted around the city are infinitely more welcome.For me, five was the best of all of the films, but six gives it a run for its money, taking the stunts to ridiculous new heights (literally). You could, of course, reprimand the film for its use of impossible feats, but that's the whole point of these films, right? To get bigger and more extreme, as demonstrated with the big and extreme – and always affable – introduction of Johnson in Fast Five.For me, Johnson changed the game and breathed new life into a franchise that was beginning to get stale, and seeing Hobbs join forces with Toretto and co makes for brilliant viewing. The action is insane and the banter is electric, with the camaraderie between the cast obvious.The only criticism of the film is its length. There was a particular moment that seemed as though the film had wrapped, though it continued for another half hour, and while what followed was laced with adrenaline and big bangs, the film could have done with a 20 minute tightening.Shaw isn't an intimidating or imposing character, particularly when facing off against Hobbs and Toretto, but he is devious, ruthless and sharp, presenting an entirely new threat to the series.Those in the know will be aware Tokyo Drift threw the timeline entirely out of sequence, but the game comes full circle at the end of the film, and you won't want to miss the credits sequence that follows Originally posted at www.zentertainmentweekly.com7/10",zentertainmentweeklydotcom,2013-05-21,2013
11,9.0,Incredible! Thoroughly enjoyable!,"I still can't believe I am giving a 9.0 to a film that is #6 in a brainless action franchise!I am not aware of any other franchise (except maybe, strangely enough, f13) where #6 is the best of the series. Normally the energy, creativity are gone by then.Not this time.I simply cannot believe how much I enjoyed every single minute of this film!There was even a decent plot!! (hey, for a film that is basically made up of fast cars, explosions and fight scenes, that says a lot!)However, I won't go into the plot - because there are some REAL twists in it, and it is better to go in with a fresh mind.It does help if you have seen the prior 5, but no sweat if you haven't. What really pleasantly surprised me was how funny this film was!! I would say about 1/2 the film was gut splitting comedy. It is rare that most jokes work in a film. Usually some fall flat. Not in this one! every single joke worked. I laughed so hard that I know I missed some!This is really meant to be seen on the big screen with a large crowd. I can't remember the last time so many people laughed, went 'WHOA!"" and ""yeah"" even clapping during a film!The film starts off with a bang and ends with a post-ending that will make you grin from ear to ear.The film deals with criminals who are obsessed with fast cars and like to create mayhem with their cars.Wall to wall action, comedy with just the right amount of drama and love interest.This could be ""the"" measurement for the brainless-feel-good-summer- action film.The only reason I am not giving this a 10.0 is because 1) it was a little long.. the final scene was almost a movie in itself (but it was a hoot!), and 2) in general I don't think any film is perfect. In some scenes (thankfully only a few) there were too many close ups that made it a little hard to follow the action. But I am really nitpicking here, folks.If you like action, fast cars, explosions, comedy....run, don't walk to see F&F 6.(and this from a guy who has the Seventh Seal and Alexander Nevsky in his DVD collection)",fritzlang,2013-05-21,2013

14,6.0,A fun addition to the franchise,"As the Fast & Furious franchise continues with it's simple enjoyments of fast cars, well oiled muscles and sexy ladies. This film does meet expectations, and is your typical faster and bigger sequel. This time the story follows Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and the gang. Who are this time not being chased but being recruited by Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson). To bring down international criminal Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) who is aided by once thought of dead Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez).What is good about the film is Director's, Justin Lin's decision to keep the film in a action-oriented direction. With a slight nods to it's street racing past. But focusing on 80's big muscle, big explosions nostalgia. Also the continuing use of practical effects over CGI backgrounds and locations. Make the film look all the more impressive. The action is over the top and a little silly but i did very much enjoy it. The only poor bit being a moment where Vin Diesel's character saves someone life taking the ridiculousness a bit to far. With the ever expanding cast the writers i imagine do have their work cut out for them. But everyone in the film except Jordana Brewster who again is given the short shrift do get their moments. But some of the comedy does miss it's mark, and the return of Letty is given the thinnest and quite unoriginal of explanations for her return. Also because of the huge cast of good guys, there is a lack of development for the villains. Making it difficult for Luke Evans who is actually very good in his role, to make a strong impression and did not become the threat to the team as much as he should of. This is a fun film, so just turn off your brain and enjoy the ride and be prepared for a very decent post credit sequence hopefully setting up a possibly very exciting Fast 7.",paulsrobinson,2013-05-19,2013
15,7.0,Fast and Furious 6 review,"The previous installments of this franchise (specifically 1,2, Tokyo Drift and 4) was all about racing, sure there's a plot but it wasn't really shown well, then part 5 happened and the franchise took a different turn, it now became a heist film instead of the usual racing. I hated and I loved this turn of the franchise, I hated it because in part 5, the racing competition aspect of the film is gone, it became chases but I also loved this turn because it made the franchise take a different approach. My question is, will this formula still work with part 6? Find out below.Story: The story in this movie picks up after the previous one where it was known that 'Letty' (Michelle Rodriguez) was still alive and I admit that they handled her ""resurrection"" quite well but that is only the sub-plot of this movie. The main plot is Hobbs (The Rock) is chasing after Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). He then gets the help of Toretto and Brian's crew by using Letty as bait (or that's how I see it). The story is pretty simple and they told it without adding anymore sub plot but some of the sub plots that were made felt very crowded to the story even though it was solved. It just felt a little heavy and a bit too much for the movie.Acting: If you saw the previous installments from this franchise well then you ain't missing anything from their performance, it's pretty much the same but I have to say this though, Vin Diesel and The Rock displays pure bad-assery in this movie. That being said, I will give my two cents on the two characters from this movie which are Gina Carano who played Riley and Luke Evans who is Owen Shaw. Carano was able to hold her own despite having little dialogue and what makes her character seems badass is because of her action scene, this is actually one of the things I'm looking forward to upon seeing this movie because I loved her in 'Haywire' (awesome film, check it out) and I;m confident to say that I am not disappointed with her on this one. Next is Luke Evans, he IMO is one the versatile actors in the industry today, you can cast him in almost any role and he displays a good performance. In here is the main villain although he gave a good performance in this role I find it hard to find him as an effective villain, there is something missing with his performance here I'm just not sure what it is.Action: The Fast franchise is definitely known for having one of the best car chases ever and this one doesn't disappoint and it does not only have car chases but also fist fights, head bangin' and other sh*t. Even though some of the action scene were very over the top it was still entertaining and was handled pretty well. The action was not violent or brutal as it showed little to no blood and being a fan of R-13 I can say that this rating does not fit well to the style of FF and I'm happy and contented with it's PG-13 rating. IMO this is the most action-packed FF film so far.Cinematography: The cinematographer did a wonderful job here, the shots were just amazing and adds depth to the mood that is set within each scene. The shots were able to show scenery that really captures the beauty of the set and like I said the mood of the scene.Direction: I wasn't much of a fan of Lin's direction here, it was pretty slow which made the film a little boring for me despite having heavy action. Even though the movie is a little slow paced, Lin was able to tell the story with it's whole heart. I liked how he did the pacing in FF 5 though.Overall: 'Fast and Furious 6' was high-octane action movie injected with some humor. Using the same formula as the previous one made this film good and also bringing back the racing aspect of the original FF films. While I consider the FF 5 is still the best one in the franchise, I can still say that this is one solid addition to it. I give this movie a 3.5/5P.S. Watch the post-credit scene, it made me get hyped for Fast and Furious 7.",whoa17,2013-05-24,2013
18,7.0,Fuious 6,"I'm going to keep this short, simple and sweet because that is exactly what this film is. It's great summer fun for all ages that manages to succeed on the one thing I hate in horror movies; make an idiot of itself. It is where this stupidity in plot events comes from that gives the film its fuel to do nothing but provide brainless over-the-top popcorn fun. It is done so by having some of the best sound editing I have heard in a while with brilliantly paced action sequences, with one fight scene in particular that will surly be the best action scene of the year. I recommend Furious 6 if you're looking to have some fun, but whatever you do, do not walk in there expecting The King's Speech, because it is not what this movie is trying to be- which makes this film so admirable.Grade: B+",edwardscissorhands123,2013-06-04,2013
19,10.0,Film of the year,"I went to the cinema with quite low expectations due to the trailer. However after watching this film i was amazed by the outcome. There was so much thrilling tense action, at one point i was on the edge of my seat. The fights and the car chases were magnificent. The series seems to be getting better and better. Fast and furious 6 is by far the best one, and i can't wait for number 7. There was so much going on and the ending was awesome. I will definitely buy this on DVD when it comes out. Great acting from the casts. This is the most entertaining film of 2013 so far. There was epic cars, sexy girls and brilliant locations.10/10",losangcodbazzinga,2013-05-22,2013
21,7.0,"An Adrenaline-Fueled Action Ride, and a Good One at that.","The Fast and the Furious franchise has never been known for an engrossing story. No one goes to the movies to see character development and a complicated storyline. They go for the cars, the girls, and the explosions, and this installment has all of the above, including a fair story.A ghost from Dom's past, Letty, has come back from the dead, and Dom reunites the team from Fast Five (a team that works on all levels) in order to get her back. Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson provide some of the humor of the film, with their bantering back and forth throughout, but I found that the theater I was in laughed and cheered throughout the course of the movie. The action is good, and never lets up. For a film that is over two hours, I found myself only checking the time when I thought the finale was happening (to see how long it would be).What you want in this film is something as good as Fast Five. Something original and fresh. What you get is something that improves on Fast Five (and the rest of the series) on all levels. This is by far the best Fast and Furious movie ever, and it really shows how a series like this can turn around from something as bad as Tokyo Drift.And it has a nice set up for Fast & Furious 7 during the credits, where we get a little surprise for the villain of the next film.Bravo, this film is awesome, and should be viewed by fans of both the series and of action movies in general.8/10",Papatheodorou,2013-07-06,2013
22,8.0,Bold imagination and beautiful execution of some of the most exhilarating car chases ever done on film make this the unequivocal franchise best thus far,"Really, how many franchises can claim to be at their best the sixth time round? But that is exactly where the 'Fast and Furious' team are at with this exercise in pure exhilaration. Just when we feared that it might be difficult to top the jaw-dropping finale in 'Fast Five', director Justin Lin proves that he has reserved his best one yet for what has been announced as his final outing at the helm after four consecutive runs.Continuing what began as an invigorating transition from streetcar racing to heist film the last time round, resident scribe Chris Morgan ups the stakes by pitting our favourite anti-heroes against their most dangerous opponent yet. That man is Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), an ex-SAS officer turned mercenary who leads a nefarious gang of criminals bent on stealing the components capable of assembling a lethal weapon to be used by terrorists. As Tyrese Gibson's designated comic relief character Roman describes, Shaw's guys are pretty much the evil twins of Toretto's team, hence the return of other familiar supporting characters like Han (Sung Kang), Tej (Chris ""Ludicrous"" Bridges) and Gisele (Gal Gadot).Even as Morgan evolves the franchise, he understands that the character dynamics have been one of the highlights of each film, and this sequel to 'Fast Five' preserves and builds on the relationships that its predecessor established. Besides the budding romance between Han and Gisele (in our opinion, exotic and very nicely played) and the deepening of familial ties between O'Conner and Toretto's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) with the birth of their child, there is sensibly the return of Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), which through the last film, transformed from dogged adversary to unlikely ally.It is Hobbs who reunites Toretto's team together to pursue Shaw - the strategic equivalent of ""fighting fire with fire"" - with no less than the promise of full pardon if they succeed. Amidst the crowded ensemble, Morgan picks up on a new angle set in motion from the concluding events of the last film. Once presumed dead, Toretto's former squeeze Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) has turned up as one of Shaw's known associates, a good part of the quieter moments of the film spent rekindling the romance between the ex-lovers.Of course, this isn't a movie with many such moments - except for the occasional expositions about family - so you can forgive the lack of character development for new supporting additions Riley (MMA fighter and 'Haywire' star Gina Carano) and Jah ('The Raid's' Joe Taslim); the former Hobbs' new partner and the latter Shaw's kungfu-kicking henchman. Instead, both Carano and Taslim are there to add a different flavour of adrenaline in the form of close-combat fight scenes, and let's just say that they each get their own sequence to show off their respective moves.But aside from an impressive bit of tag-team ass-kicking from Toretto and Hobbs against one of Shaw's equally hulk-sized crew (Kim Kold), the bulk of the action is meant to unfold against broad open canvases, as opposed to close quarters. Lin neatly - and we might add, beautifully - choreographs three elaborate chase sequences with loads of automobile destruction that the franchise has been known for, even more extraordinary for how he manages to top one after the next.In chronological order, Lin begins with a grand introduction to Shaw and his gang with an intricately staged chase down the streets of London - although the fact that Shaw's military-styled vehicle looks like the Batmobile from Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight' trilogy might provide a hint where Lin could have gotten his inspiration. Yet any doubts about Lin's originality are quickly dispelled once we get to the second setpiece, a boldly imagined art of mass destruction matched equally in its stunning execution. As the trailer has amply teased, this one has Toretto and his crew behind the wheel in pursuit of Shaw and his men inside a tank on a Canaries highway.The most breathtaking of all he leaves for last, which though utterly ludicrous, represents probably one of the most awesome stunt pieces you will see this year. Since no other film has dared to use cars to take down a Russian cargo plane about to take off, Lin does just that. Not only do Toretto's team face off with Shaw's mob in cars racing at near impossible speeds, they attach their vehicles to the wings of the plane with gleeful abandon to any thought of their own lives - though as a warning, not all will make it through to the already announced sequel next summer. If Lin intends to go out with a 'bang', let's just say he accomplishes it many times over.The exquisitely staged vehicular mayhem is complemented by a firm sense of camaraderie amongst Toretto's group. Gibson's one-liners are snappy and more amusing than they were in 'Fast Five', and his banter with Kang and Ludicrous not only keep the film's momentum going while the plot pieces are put in place but also establish the kind of teamwork necessary for the subsequent action scenes. And not forgetting the brawny charisma of Diesel and Johnson, which enliven the film as much as they did in the last one.If you ask us to judge this against then-franchise best 'Fast Five', we'd say that this more than tops the fun and excitement that it offered. There are two qualities which make or break a 'Fast and Furious' film - how enjoyable is it to hang out with Toretto and his crew and how thrilling are the car chases. On both counts, this sixth entry surpasses the heights established by its predecessor, setting an even higher bar for its successor.

23,7.0,"Fast 6, Fast but not quite as Furious as the previous outing","The Fast and Furious franchise is one of the more strange ones – it improved the older it became. Coinciding with the 10 year anniversary of the The Fast and the Furious, Fast 5 marked the highpoint in the hugely popular series. Street racing culture was ditched in favor of a heist plot in Rio de Janeiro. To say it worked would be a massive understatement. Fast 6 is continuing where its predecessor left off, although with a little twist. As it has already been explained in the trailers, the team surrounding Vin Diesel's Torreto character is asked to help Luke Hobbs (played by the ever charismatic Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) capturing criminal mastermind Owen Shaw (portrayed by Luke Evans), this time around in London. The Good Working in its favor is the wonderful backdrop provided by the London metropolitan area. It offers a lot of variety and distinguishes Fast 6 from the previous entry. The chemistry between Torreto's crew is as good as it has ever been. Furthermore, The Rock really meshes well with any of the gang.Tyrese, without going into detail the banter he shares with Ludicrous or the aforementioned Dwayne Johnson is worth the ticket admission alone. It's obvious that his character serves as comedic relief, as has been the case in Fast 5, but he has to have the funniest scenes in any of the major (non-comedy) blockbusters this year. The action in the FF series was never realistic to begin with, so no surprises here. Still, it shouldn't take away from some impressive set- pieces. Justin Lin knows what he's doing. The Bad Fast 6 is too crowded; there are too many characters in the movie. Even the main villain, Owen Shaw, is underdeveloped, as is the Letty sub- plot. It just feels like the producers were gung-ho about reuniting the principle actors from the very first FF movie, at any cost. Gina Carano, though she can definitely hold her own in the action scenes her acting is wooden at best. If pressed for a comparison – she'd be a bad female imitation of notorious stoneface Keanu Reeves. There's little to no facial expression. Frankly, her character is redundant. She may have pulled a half-decent performance in Haywire, but given the nature of her character (a stoic, hardened, operative) it played right to her strengths (or lack thereof?). At this rate it's hard to see her carrying a movie anytime soon. Conclusion Fast 6 is one of the better flicks in the franchise, perhaps the second best, but some way off Fast 5. One can't help but feel that the finished product has been rushed into production. A little fine-tuning (no pun intended) here and there would've served the movie better. The ending in particular is a little underwritten; it's not as glorious or as satisfying as Fast 5.",j-pryde,2013-05-19,2013
24,2.0,You shouldn't watch this movie if:,No content,jedimaster_yoda,2013-06-10,2013
25,7.0,Level of Absurdity,"2011's Fast Five was the franchise's glory for abandoning the sins that slows down their movies and excel to something crazier and suitable to what it is called. Fast & Furious 6 grows the scale with even more ridiculous car racing and stunts. Now it involves a fight between military and terrorism while it has a serious sentiment about family. Things can get way out of hand, but the film is so fun, it's hard complain about how stupid it is. It's not a classic, but the stuff that are supposedly awkward actually made the film a fantastically exhilarating ride.Before, there were just street racing and cartels. The last one is about an extreme heist. Now they are chasing down super terrorists, running away from tanks, and a character who faked her death. The more stories they tell, the sillier it becomes, but no matter how absurd these are, they are still a pleasure to watch. They are really forgetting the mistakes of the past(first four) films and think more creative ways to excite the viewers. The series also finally has a highlighting villain. A campy one as well that could fit in a superhero movie. The weakest parts of the story are the twists that are much inane than the craziness it was displayed. The sideline of the plot is about family. It contrasts between Dom's team who are loyal, and Owen's team who are careless. It's a fine speculation but nobody would care about it.We are here for the racing, cars crashing, and some fistfights. The last film had cars that can pull off a vault, now we see a bunch of cars pulling down a cargoplane. It shows how it insanely ignores the laws of physics. It's exasperating if you take it too seriously, but I don't think anyone would ever take a blockbuster like this too seriously. However, they are amazingly directed. The tank scene, which was already beyond ridiculous, was kind of inspired. And the early London chase was an energetic sequence. The performances are the same before. What's new about Vin Diesel is the swagger he makes in the end. Dwayne Johnson is always entertaining, but he is much entertaining when he was beating a guy around an interrogation room. Newcomer Luke Evans really makes a worth rooting villain. His character is not as well developed as any villains from big blockbusters, but he manages to make this one slickly fun.Fast & Furious 6 reaches the scale of blockbusters that have superheroes, super spies, aliens, or whatever. Except the cars are the ones that have superpowers here. These set of magnificently dumb action sequences reminiscence your standard blockbuster when this film is suppose to be smaller than those kinds of films. It's strangely grander and louder, but of course, it's also as fast as the title suggests. Verdict would still call Fast Five the best of the series, but honestly they are both equally good. This one just takes a new level of absurdity even though the characters are trying to be down to earth. Fast & Furious 6 is far from perfect but as a modern blockbuster it's an extremely entertaining film.",billygoat1071,2013-05-25,2013
27,6.0,Quirky humor and insane set pieces overcome its shoddy plot,"While it doesn't reach the same height as Fast Five, the newest and most ludicrous installment of the franchise thus far still packs a lot of noisy high octane entertainment in its engine. With increasingly expanding star-studded cast, Fast & Furious 6 exhibits a lot of value by just pinning these familiar names together in scenes, despite some of the script they use doesn't really work. It has good amount of humor, and also highly dubious amnesia plot. Quite frankly, it does its best when it doesn't try to be serious.Starring buff gents and ladies, almost everyone on-screen has weighty name, although they are heavily leaning towards action oriented rather than acting, which might've been the direction from the start. Plot revolves around Vin Diesel trying to woe the amnesic Michelle Rodriguez, thus involving the crew into a shady military operation in the process. It gives what people want in spade, the bridging between set pieces is fairly clumsy, but it does pay off with ridiculous amount of flying cars and bodies.Surprisingly enough, there are plenty of melee brawl across the movie. The addition of Gina Carano, the MMA star, is a good choice, she brings the rawness in these scenes. Several others will join the fray in close combat, obvious if they have The Rock and Vin Diesel it'd be a waste not to. However, there are some stunts that borderline corny and unrealistic, even by Fast and Furious standard, many wiring might look awkward as well. It's not a major concern, but I prefer the more structured natural stunts rather the high flying ones.Chasing scenes have been up-scaled, bringing ramp cars, tank and whatnot into the mix. Apparently, there's demand for even more over-the-top driving scenes to fulfill. This is where it truly shines, fast motion, carnage all around and seemingly impossible traits. The building up and finish are somewhat imbalance, sometimes resorting to incredibly odd coincidences. Script works adequately, some of its jokes are better than others, and definitely league ahead compare to the supposedly more dramatic scenes.Fast & Furious goes extra miles for crowd enjoyment. Action junkies or car enthusiast will be pleased, however the result is less organized pace. The movie is a blast, even if there are shortcomings, catering directly to the core audience.Rate 6.5",quincytheodore,2013-05-23,2013
28,6.0,Loads of Action!,"Review: I quite enjoyed this action packed movie, which had a decent storyline and loads of car chases and explosions. It's basically want you expect from a movie in this franchise, which was what I found a bit disappointing because there wasn't much fresh ideas. The tank and the plane was a bit different but that was about it. What made me laugh was the length of the runway for the plane scene and it was amazing how they made England look so glossy. Anyway, if you look at the money that the movie made, expect many sequels and with the introduction of the Rock in the last movie, he has obviously made a massive difference to the franchise. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Everyone in this movie has been in the gym before there scenes because it sacked full of muscles. Even the ladies show that they can hold there own against the men. The Rock is over pumped and in every scene he looks like he's sweating because he has just put the weights down. Anyway, the director done a good job with putting this movie together, especially as it was set in England. Some of the stunts were a bit over the top, but that's what you expect from a Fast & Furious movie. All the way through the film, Vin Diesel is sizing himself up next to the Rock, but I liked the chemistry between them. In all, there wasn't anything that really stood out about the film, but it does keep you on the edge of your seat and you just don't know what there going to come up with next. Maybe boats or horses, lol.Budget: $160million Worldwide Gross: $789millionI recommend this movie to people who are into the Fast & Furious franchise, which always brings loads of action and, of course, cars. 6/10",leonblackwood,2013-09-22,2013
29,8.0,In life Speed and Family are the two best things,"From the first frame of Fast and Furious 6 we realize that this is not really about a movie about heist and car chases (well okay it has this); no this is a movie about the depths you will go and the willingness to do whatever you can to protect family. Leaving off where Fast five left off, most of the characters are off on there, whether it be hanging in Tokyo, flying pretty ladies to manacu to making people feel low about there rough life to a new baby being born, the crew is in hiding and living the life abroad. It's at the point that the plot ramps up and we get a Dom Terretto going after a would be thief Owen Shaw ( a new type of villain) and trying to save the somehow resurrected Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) who has joined Shaw in his wanting to take over the world. Bring most people back from the Fast Five and you got yourself a movie. This movie isn't what I call the most coherent, it has issues and Owen Shaw's character is kind of one note, but this isn't the type of movie that you need to worry about great story. It's the type of movie that you go to watch and have fun , and watch the unbelievable happen. Everyone In this movie looks like there comfortable being there and seem to be having fun. It's what I would call an audience movie, the type of movie that feels In sync enough that everyone's on board There are plenty of laughs thanks to Tyrese and plenty of drama thanks to Toretto and Brian's relationship and history in the series. They pull together to do the subject justice. I don't want to spoil anything but this movie does lead up to a point that all the films finally have a connecting tissue and what you thought you knew with the bonus scene at the end will lead into an interesting 7th film. Lets just hope James Wan doesn't ruin the good will this series has gained.",buiredintime,2013-05-14,2013

31,8.0,Definitely Fast and Definitely Furious,"I'm not to fond a franchises that don't when it's time to hang it up and let it's running time leave a good memory in our brains but for some reason, the studios want to keep this franchise going but I must say I'm glad they haven't because Fast and Furious 5 was pretty dope and now I can say Fast and Furious 6 is just as equally amazing. I was actually excited to see this movie and believe me when I say, I wasn't disappointed in the least. I'm an action movie junkie, and this film had plenty of it. I've been enjoying the F&F transformation from being a movie about illegal street racing and stealing car parts, to heists, drug lords, undercover agents, the cartel and now, even terrorism. There was plenty of car chases, hand to hand combat, shoot outs and even a breathtaking ending scene hat involved an airport, a huge aircraft and a takeoff runway that was definitely awesome to watch. Doing six films would definitely bring the cast together, and you can see their chemistry on screen, especially between Tyrese, Ludicrous, the Asian dude and the south American beauty. There comedic banter was funny. I was pleasantly surprised with our antagonist, Luke Evans. I'm used to seeing him play the hero and aiding the good side, so seeing him as the bad guy was different but it worked. Not only is a beyond sexy with that shaved head but it totally worked. My favorite scene was with Riley (from Haywire) chasing Michelle Rodriguez through the subway and Tyrese and Asian dude's character chasing the other bad guy through the subway. My only pet peeve was the dialogue. You would think that after six movies, the writers could come up with more realistic things for the cast to say instead writing all these cheesy one liners that we've been hearing in 90% of all action movies for the past twenty years. Some of the lines really made me cringe and I had to whisper to myself ""really Justin Lin?! That's the best you got?!"" But the cheesy one liners were overlooked by a few unpredictable plot twists that helped the story move along.But overall I give this movie an 8 because it gives you everything an action movies is supposed to offer. Believable bad ass heroes and villains, car chases, big guns, explosions, shoot outs, hand to hand combat, sexy ass kicking women, beautiful cars, sexy men, funny moments, an unforgettable ending action sequence, and of course a post credits scene that makes you anxious for the seventh film. I would definitely recommend this film.",champjohnson29,2013-05-27,2013

36,6.0,Watch it with half the brain you used to watch Fast Five with,"Oh wow, this is what you call jumping the shark. It all started in 2001 with a low budget film about the street racing subculture. Now its become an action film franchise with over the top machismo. Each film progressively chipped away more logic and physics.Now I actually liked Fast Five because it actually had a believable premise given the context. Yes it was cheesy and over testosteroned but it actually had a well paced plot. However the cast has ballooned to a very large size, this film's become very unfocused. So much so that every character is now laughably one dimensional. There are numerous contrived plot points and no character ever questions anything. The Rock's character is after a bad guy but since the bad guy uses cars, oh, I need Vin Diesel AND HIS TEAM for this. And yeah, everyone is willing no question.I thought that Fast Five actually concluded the characters story arcs but they wanted to due a fan service by resurrecting Michelle Rodriguez. And it was done in the most contrived fashion as possible by giving her amnesia.The film did have some pretty good set pieces but sadly you saw all these action sequences in the trailer. And thats because the film slows down in the second act and it tries to liven up by even putting in a street race in the middle of a surprisingly empty London. And that's weird seeing how each film's plot revolves around how many car stunts they can put in.And the action scenes really make the vault drag in Fast Five physically plausible. There is so much flying around and defying gravity, I'll bet you'll see less in the upcoming Superman film. And the physics of this film is so inconsistent. In the tank scene we see the villain engage in casual murder by pancaking all the cars in a highway yet it seems to have trouble crushing Tyrese's car. Also the plane scene in the climax; that must be the longest runway in the world.I can see why Justin Lin took this franchise to that many films, because the initial ones weren't that profitable. However at over 2 hours long, you start wondering how you could take any of the cheesy dialogue that fills this film seriously.Oh well, its pure popcorn pleasure. It knows what it does, even though you'll be palming your forehead at many instances.",arnieiam,2013-06-04,2013
39,8.0,Pure Entertainment,"Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker) are asked by Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) to stop Shaw (Luke Evans) the leader of a criminal crew of skilled mercenary drivers who are acquiring parts to build a powerful gun to be sold to terrorists. Shaw needs one last chip to complete the gun. If successful Dom's crew will get a full pardon from their illegal exploits during Fast and Furious 5. I was told that F&F 6 was the best one of all the sequels, And, after seeing this I believe they are correct. Of course it was all the vehicle chases that made it for me. What I saw was almost unbelievable. I don't know how much CGI was in evidence, but I do know that over 70 stunt men were used (I counted them in the credits) so I would venture to say these stunts with vehicles were fantastic.You will see some things that you will have you saying, ""that's impossible."" Maybe so, but this is excellent entertainment. Suspend logic and enjoy yourself. The photography and editing were incredible to say the least. As you watch you may have wished your couch came with seat belts. Kudos all around. You go to these kinds of movies to see the vehicle chases, not for the acting which was okay for this is type of movie. For the most part , there is not a lot of dialogue in here. Oh, and for your viewing pleasure the director saw fit to throw in an Army tank and a big cargo plane. Wait until you see how they are used. Wow! This just gets better and better. So if you like car chases with vehicles and people flying thru the air, and explosions this is for you. Hey, I was entertained. Yes, there is a story here too, but it plays second fiddle and there is a twist you may not see coming. Also, Dom finds out that his former love interest, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), is alive and working for Shaw (Say What???). How can this be? Dom needs to find out. Oh, when it's all over keep your seat belt on because after many of the credits run, you will see that F&F 7 is in the works and you won't believe who will be in it. Stay tuned. (8/10)Violence: Yes.

43,7.0,A surprisingly enjoyable film.,"Fast & Furious 6 is not the kind of film that I generally like. It's preposterous, absurd and completely in your face. But I enjoyed it! It's not really a good film, let alone a great one. However, that does not really matter. This is a film that does not take itself too seriously - and it's all the better for it. The director and the cast seem to know exactly what they're doing - and they deliver a film that won't live long in the memory but which nonetheless provides two hours or so of solid entertainment that allows the viewer to forget about the stresses and strains of modern life for a while. And, it does so very well indeed. Much of the film is set in London. The plot strains credulity and is full of holes. It took me a while to get used to some of the characters and what I assume were occasional references to their back stories (because I have not seen any of the 5 earlier films in this seemingly ever popular series). But, to be honest, the details of the plot are not really that important. Fast & Furious 6 is an almost wholly visual film about machismo, crazy driving sequences and adventure. Vin Diesel (that cannot be his real name, surely?) is very good in the lead role and he is ably supported by a cast that seems to have been plucked from the United Nations branch of central casting. I particularly liked Luke Evans (Owen Shaw), who plays the arch baddie.Fast & Furious 6 is the sort of film that defies rational criticism. It's a delightfully innocent, energetic and enjoyable romp. 7/10",roger-pettit1,2013-05-20,2013

45,7.0,Just another evolution of the series not the revolution,"Like a well-oiled engine, the Fast & Furious series can be counted on to deliver what it promises on the box: gleaming cars, thrilling chases, and buff stars who look like they've stepped out of the pages of a fitness magazine. The new installment, Fast & Furious 6 is just as dumb as the previous films, and its action scenes so furiously edited that it's hard to tell who's doing what, and to whom. But, as we've come to learn, that's the charm of these moviesthe stunts are outrageous, and the plot basic enough for an eight-year-old to enjoy.The new film opens with our heroes Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) enjoying their retirement, when federal agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) shows up to recruit them in a mission to capture professional hijacker Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). The incentive for Don is a possible reunion with his ex, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who was presumed dead at the end of the fourth film and who now may be working with Shaw.Director Justin Lin packs the film with back-to-back chases and set-pieces, never giving you a moment to ponder over the fact that you have no idea till the end, exactly what our villain is after – some codes are mentioned, but never clearly explained. The action itself is outrageous, and whether we're seeing real stunts or special effects, or a cocktail of both, it's pretty entertaining stuff. Cars are flipped like pancakes every few seconds, an armored tank creates carnage on a bridge, and an airplane is demolished in the climax.For those who enjoy their action a little more gritty, you'll be happy to know Gina Carano (Mixed Martial Arts star, and leading lady of Steven Soderbergh's Haywire) is cast as Hobbs' sidekick, and she gets down and dirty in a thrilling girl-on-girl fistfight with Rodriguez in the London Underground.Don't expect any improvement in the dialogue – the actors still mouth lines that appear to have been stolen from bumper stickers – and the performances are basically a range of stock expressions: angry, very angry, mad as hell.At 2 hours and 11 minutes, it's a little too long, and even the most devoted action-movie fans will sense the exhaustion creeping in. But don't leave until you've caught that post- credits cameo from a popular British star who sets up next year's seventh installment.I'm going with seven ratings for Fast & Furious 6. It's loud and noisy, and a lot of fun even if it doesn't make much sense.",visheshvijay,2013-08-04,2013
46,2.0,This is an opinion review,"I walked into the cinema expecting to write something about this being the must see film for the weekend, remembering the nostalgia of the original and the progressively worse but still kinda cool sequels (except for that abortion Tokyo Drift we'd all like to forget we saw) and the redeeming previous installment Fast Five that somehow redeemed and reinvented the franchise introducing 'The Rock' as a kick-ass anti-hero and started the franchise on a remarkably cool path with fast paced action that was grounded with a great balance of realism and ""plausible"" suspension of belief.What I walked away with was having my mind raped by the worse script (CENSORED) It is near impossible to believe this is the same writer and director duo from Fast Five - but then they were also responsible for Tokyo Drift. Firstly, for some reason they have dropped all of the iconic moments that we have come to love and expect. There is no action packed opening scene filled with car chases and metal carnage. Instead we are treated to being teased with a quick race where nothing happens and shown the aftermath of what must've been an incredible heist, and then, when we eventually do get to see some car chase scenes we quickly realize that they have also done away with those camera shots that weave in and out of the cars putting you in the center of the action.Gone is the great balance of realism and ""plausible"" suspension of belief and instead Furious 6 was written with absolutely no regard to physics or common sense. It's one thing to have cars flipped over by driving head first into them with a ramp attached to the car, its another thing entirely to have bobbies keeping pace with a super fast custom F1 type of thing and almost overtaking it. But that's small compared to the crap they actually came up with for this movie. Think super fast chase scenes with a tank (oxymoronic) and people flying through the air superman style like neo catching a damsel in distress mid air after being flung from... I'm just gonna stop there. Have your eyes raped spoiler free but don't blame me for the loss of reasoning skills as you're trying to forget to think all together just so you can soak up the visual aspects of this redonculous spectacle.It's actually infuriating to watch a movie with some cool bits while realizing the absurdity of what you are expected to swallow.At one point there's this huge cargo plane landing on a runway but keeps cruising so it can take off again and this 20min action scene develops with cars driving into the cargo hold of the plane and fighting erupting everywhere, in the plane, around the plane and it never runs out of runway, for over 20 minutes. Now call me crazy but at some point everyone in the cinema turned to each other and said this is ridiculous, we all as a unit got up and refused to have our intelligence mocked while expecting to sit through this crap and we burned the place to the ground.Here's some math: a typical airliner cruises at about 160mph for takeoff. 160 ÷ 60 x 20 = a 53.3 mile long runway.The best thing about the movie was the fighting between the female characters. That's probably because they cast MMA star Gina Carano opposite Michelle Rodriguez.Will this be one of those movies you love to hate or is it simply too mind numbingly $#*&?",dewetnmail,2013-07-27,2013

54,6.0,"You get what you expect, as long as you don't expect much","Movies from the Fast and Furious franchise always bring up the same problem. If the cars are fast enough and the explosions are big enough, is the fact that there are uninteresting characters and a brainless story irrelevant? After all, people see these movies for the action, and in the case of Fast Six, it delivers handily. But newcomers to the Fast and Furious world that long for an intelligent story in their movies may want to stay as far away as possible, because the plot in Fast Six is a dud. What it all boils down to is that the most loyal devotees of the franchise will find lots to enjoy, but it won't be making many new fans either. This really is a shame, especially because last year's Fast Five made me a believer in a film series I had long thought had no sign of life.This isn't to say that the movie is terrible. In some ways it even exceeds Fast Five. Vin Diesel's (back as Dominic Toretto) stone-faced acting and deep monotone is an almost welcome sight at this point, as it has become a staple of the franchise; and Dwayne Johnson as Hobbs is as entertaining as ever. Like in all the Fast and Furious movies, the acting is best when the fists do the talking. The movie has some clever throwbacks to Johnson's wrestling days and just visualizing Vin Diesel's flying head-butt brings a smile to my face. An excellent call was made in casting Gina Carano as Hobb's partner Riley. She may have very few lines, but her fight scenes are incredible. If you haven't, see her in last year's Haywire which is tremendously underrated.The dialog, which has often inflicted this franchise like a plague, has been greatly improved this time around. Don't be fooled, it still isn't great, but the clichés and bad jokes have for the most part been eradicated. One of the most impressive amendments the film makes is the strength of the banter between the principle cast, which is among the most glaring issues with its predecessors. This is especially true in regards to the back-and-forth antics of Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Ludacris), both of which I had originally hoped they wouldn't bring back for this sequel. I was prepared to be annoyed by them, but was pleasantly surprised by their genuinely witty jokes. I also thought it was a smart move to not bring back every single character from the previous films. Fast Five was largely unsuccessful in juggling its many characters. This time, there's just the right amount of characters for the film to play with, so longtime fans needn't worry as most of their favorite characters are back and have more screen time.The problems with Fast Six are rooted in its story that defies logic and the absurd melodrama and pointless twists that accompany it. The plot reads as nothing more than a bad soap opera with Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) being brought back from the dead and suffering from amnesia. The amnesia ends up playing out solely as a vehicle for inconsequential drama with no regard to the actual affects amnesia would have. Equally outrageous, is the film's villain Shaw (Luke Evans), who is the antithesis to everything Toretto believes and stands for. His motivations are as unoriginal as they come and his actions are so questionable you wonder how this guy was so hard to catch in the first place. Let's not forget he also has his own ragtag team of criminals that mirror Toretto's. It's not a compliment. The film even refers to them (out loud) as their evil twins, so you know in true melodramatic fashion, they each have to fight their own counterpart in the climax. I really do wish I was making all this up.Far too often the film resides in sentimentality. Toretto constantly addresses how important his makeshift ""family"" is to him; a nice message for sure, but the constant reminders lessen the impact. In the film's most cringe worthy scene, Shaw argues the flaws of Toretto's belief, which begs the question of why he even cares. As is par for the course for the Fast and Furious movies, the characters have little depth. Only fans of the series can enjoy them, but only because they've been exposed to them for six films; it's merely a side effect.If you can stomach the bad, the movie can be very rewarding. After all, this is an action film, and that is what it does best. The film has more of the physics defying action that is so beloved in the Fast and Furious universe. Particularly, the two set pieces in the last forty minutes, which include a tank AND a plane, are worth seeing the movie for alone. It reminded me of why I liked Fast Five so much. Because the best parts of the movie are crammed in at the end, the rest of the film suffers as a result. It would have been better to see something more grandiose in the first ninety minutes that would grab my attention and hold it throughout the film, similar to Fast Five. I got the impression that after how over-the-top fun Fast Five's ending was, director Justin Lin felt that the only way to up the ante was to make everything bigger. But part of the joy of Fast Five's climax was how wonderfully original it was conceived. It is proof that bigger isn't always better.With all the highs and lows taken into account, Fast Six equates into nothing more than a noisy ""OK"". What is most frustrating of all is that after Fast Five injected some much needed energy into this lifeless franchise, that this one doesn't quite carry the torch. But with quite an intriguing cliffhanger (stick through the credits), I'm hopeful for next year's installment.",Engenius,2013-06-11,2013

Hobbs shows a recent photo of Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) that is a member of Shaw's gang to convince Dom to work with him and promises pardon for Dom and his ""family"" if they succeed to take Shaw down. Hobbs and his partner Riley (Gina Carano) travel with Dom, Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and their team to London where Shaw is plotting an evil scheme. ""Furious 6"" is a brainless and overrated movie, with nice cars, car races, beautiful girls but a moronic story. The viewer must be acephalous to enjoy this movie and to list the flaws in the plot would take too much time. My favorite one is in the end, with the longest take-off strip of the world.

58,7.0,"High volatile action, cool car chases and strong performances by entire star cast makes it a commendable watch","Enthralling car chases , heavy-duty action scenes coupled with live- action heroes like Rock and Vin Diesel is what defines Fast & Furious 6. Fasten your seat belt cause this one gonna blow your mind !!!Hobbs gathers Dom & team to track down an international mastermind Shaw who is designing a tech bomb which is capable of blocking the entire military communication grid. From the director of Tokyo Drift and Fast Five , Justin Lin gives you yet another knockout core action film which is breath-taking and stunning. The story is simple but it is execution part which is effective. Though the screenplay falters especially the runway action sequence ( which never ends :) ) but the gripping performance and well- choreographed stunts will keep you entertained. Cinematography is excellent . Art direction is spellbinding. Editing could have been better. It is Vin Diesel and The Rock which steal your heart with captivating performances. Paul Walker and Michelle Rodriguez lends in good support. I liked the fight scene displayed by Gina Carano ( MMA fighter featured as actress in HayWire(2011))Overall , I liked Fast & Furious 6 with high volatile action , cool car chase and strong performances by entire star cast.

59,7.0,Mind Blowing,"For those of you looking for any Oscar nominations in this place, Fast 6 is not your type of movie. The name of the movie is Fast & Furious 6 and you must know what to expect from it. If you want to get your mind blown with some intense action sequences Fast 6 is here to entertain you. Intense Fight Scenes, American Muscle, F1 Cars, Tanks, Planes you name it. This movie has everything and all thanks to director Justin Lin. This movie comes up with everything you expected and unexpected. Very well directed action sequences and extremely hilarious comedy. Usually it's very difficult to make me laugh and sometimes I reply it with a giggle but Fast 6 really got me laughing out loud. Take a suggestion, leave your brain and facts at home and you'll have great time with this movie. Fast 6 well deserves 7.5/10",CaptKeshav,2013-05-27,2013

63,9.0,Amazingly faster and more furious than ever,"From the first Fast & Furious these films has been a great success. At first OK and good entertainment, and undeniably a good idea. The second two was a let down with too much sideways driving, but then things started happening again. The fifth outing Fast Five was surprisingly the best so far. It WAS fast & furious! The pace was excellent, the story was good and the driving was amazing. This sixth outing adds a lot to the last success, which made 630 million dollars in the cinemas only. The world's biggest car film franchise!F&F6 which premiered in London a week before the rest, due to London being the base here, is ferociously faster and more furious than ever. The only thing that doesn't take off here, is the plane in the end! F&F6 is starring some of the most amazing sports cars classic car lovers adore. This time also European super-cars!The amazing British handmade Jensen Interceptor, the ultra rare Dodge Charger Daytona made in only 300 ex (though here in a replica) and the sporting legend of a every day classic, the Ford Escort RS2000 are tangled in together with the well known Mustang and Corvette. You'll also find a Plymouth Barracuda, a 2011 Dodge Charger, A Nissan GTR, BMW M5, Alfa Romeo and Aston Martin is also present. Put into the mix the most classic tank driving since James Bond drowned his in Russia, sadly enough crushing a Mustang, and you got a driving focused classic which is even better than the Fast Five!This is a continuation of Fast Five, and some kind of prequel to the first. Impressive action stunts, fast cars, sexy entertainment, well acted by the crew we've grown to like so much. Amazing driving action is the driving force of this film, containing a car chase on a long strip against a plane, and a long carcasses a city night. I love that Gina Carano is added to the crew. This is so right it can possible be. This seems to be an unstoppable success story, which will continue to bring classic drivers cars out of oblivion, making new fast for the old classics which should be preserved for the future in a world where cars are looking like bars of soap.As long as this franchise can keep up with the feel good action and showing the use of nasty cars and chic girls combined with an effective story which includes the classic car chases, this will deliver the thrills.What will be the cars in the seventh outing? I bet for a Monteverdi, most certainly a Maserati and a nice TWR. I'd sure love to see more of the Jensen Interceptor, so may I suggest a four wheel drive FF-battle between Jensen FF racing against a Ferrari FF? I suggest the name FF7 - Fast & Furious Four Wheel Drive!Don't leave the cinema too early. In an extra clip you'll get a little glimpse of what to expect in the next episode, and who's the obvious bad guy in this. Well, we just have to wait a year, because the seventh is on a year from now. Enjoy the rides! I sure did!",OJT,2013-05-13,2013

66,7.0,Action Overdose,"OK this film is worth watching, however the older you are the more you will be put off by the quantity of action in it.Everyone managed to have at least one worthy performance. Although some of the better actors managed to perform well throughout the entire film.For me the disappointment was with Bruce Willis and the quiet Chinese guy. They were the most unconvincing performances.Like bad roller coaster rides, the kind that do more than just excite/thrill you, by the end of the ride you feel sick and never want to go on it again. This also describes this film's viewing experience.If only they could beef up the script, tone down the action, stop putting in, so called ""cash magnet"" actors like Bruce Willis, (that really should retire.) Add some depth along with a more sophisticated soundtrack. They would have made a one-to-remember type film.I normally do not like ""the Rock"" however in this film he does one of his best and believable performances! I really liked Vin Petrol too, he was awesome in this film and I wish he would act in more credible titles. The guy that plays the baddie is very good, once again proving he is around to stay.Anyway all in all a good movie, one that requires zero brain power to process, yet not quite boring enough to send you to sleep half way through.Summary A cliché feel good action flick.Questions... Is it worth cinema viewing? - No; Is it worth buying? - No! Therefore wait until it is on the TV or hire it out when there are no more ""Big Titles"" left to watch. ;)",killgamers,2013-07-07,2013
67,5.0,I don't get how this and the previous installment were so well received. They're utterly stupid.,"A rare film that I saw in the theater and barely remembered I saw it just a few hours later. Honestly, I had no interest in it, was just with family over Memorial Day weekend and had a free ticket anyway. Still, what a waste of time. Who cares about the plot? Whenever the characters are talking between action sequences, it's pure torture. Who gives a crap what these people are saying? The action sequences themselves are somewhat amusing, but they aren't really that good. Too much editing, leading to occasional confusion. Physics are completely ignored. Momentum, inertia, gravity: fuhgetaboutit. When I watched the fifth F&F movie, which I did because it actually got very good reviews somehow, I thought to myself, eh, maybe I disliked it because I was watching it at home alone, which is clearly not the right environment. But hanging out with family and seeing the sixth one with an audience, yeah, I think they really do suck (though, truth be told, I remember enjoying the first one, which I saw on video with my brother when it came out).",zetes,2013-06-02,2013
69,7.0,"As if swanky cars weren't enough, Fast and Furious now have 'Tank' rampaging the roads—and, you are in for one hell of a ride!","Yipin (Justin) Lin nails another F&F movie. The 6th installment doesn't just pick the tempo where Fast 5 concluded; it gets bigger too, and straightaway—no lag on plot development or character insights as it is already all set. From scene one you have fast cars in action, trailblazing through some beautiful locales.F&F also provides what was amiss in Fast 5—a real villain of credibility in Shaw (Luke Evans), well supported by his sidekicks who match (even betters) Dom's crew blow-by-blow, i.e., until the climax of course.Action in the film, as it was supposed to, overshadows all other aspect of the film but comedy, overall acting, editing, camera work, special effects, etc. gel well in this in this high octane showdown.All in all, a perfect summer blockbuster for action buffs.If the sneak-peek of F&F is anything to go by then the F&F 7 is going to be even 'massiver'—the newest addition (current tycoon of action films) to cast/franchise certainly indicates so! What more. Being a huge fan of Diesel's 'Riddick', I hope the success of F&F avails him enough riches to decently market/promote another potent, niche-focused, action/adventure franchise of his.7.5/10",YasheshJ,2013-05-26,2013

73,9.0,Fast & Furious 6 Movie Review By Andrew Brauer,"It's crazy to see that this franchise has gone to a sixth entry, but what is even more surprising is that it's actually been getting better. The first four Fast & The Furious were pretty cheesy action movies that would cater to a certain demography, but when Fast Five came out in 2011, I was very surprised at how much fun I had with it, and If I did review movies back in 2011, that would've been on my Top 10 of Best for the year. Now two years later we have Fast & Furious 6, which takes place where Fast Five finished, Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew are living large as millionaires but Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) shows up and needs Dom's help, as a new group of criminals led by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) is after an important computer chip that could lead to a even bigger threat. But the big reason why Dom and his crew will help out, is because one of Shaw's right hand men is Dom's former lover Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) who died in one of the previous films, but turns out to not be dead. Dom, Brian, Roman, Tej, and everyone else returns to rescue Letty, and clear they're names for good. Now for starters, does this film have the greatest writing or acting in the world, of course not, but it is insanely fun and without a doubt one of the most entertaining films this year. This film is extremely well directed with Justin Lin (Fast Five) at the helm, the action sequences look incredible and every time something big and exciting was about to happen, I was pumped up and was giggling with excitement. In fact, the final action sequence is one of the coolest action scenes I've witnessed in a long time. The pacing is also quick and hardly slows down, whereas for the story is simple and hardly focuses on it, unless it involves the overall message about family and togetherness. Fast & Furious 6 has what was missing out of Pacific Rim, which the problem with Pacific Rim was too much story, not enough action, Fast & Furious 6 is all action, little story, and it works so well. The acting is fine, everyone has been doing these movies for a while so they know what their doing and they do it well. The humor is great as several times I cracked up (most of it is from the comic relief of Tyrese Gibson's Roman), the soundtrack is great, and although the writing is pretty silly, it does serve for some truly perfect quotes. Problems are that logic is thrown out the window for this film, if you think more than you watch, you'll just hate watching this because hardly anything makes sense. And some scenes around the middle go on a little too long, especially the prison scene. But Fast & Furious 6 is comfortable with what kind of film it is, a silly, over the top, but extremely entertaining crowd pleaser. I haven't this much fun with a movie in a long time, all you need to know is fast cars, hot girls, explosions, and muscles. Just leave your brain at home and enjoy the ride.",andrewbrauer96,2013-11-24,2013

78,7.0,The Best One Yet!,"Yes, I am aware of the fact I have written ""The Best One Yet!"" and only gave it a seven out of ten. Yes, I loved the movie but it did not exceed all my expectations. The length, well, it was very long. I wouldn't be bothered about the length but this film did not amaze me, and I wasn't prepared to see more. The plot. I liked it, but there was a flaw. Yes, it was about cars and racing, but unlike all the other ones, this had the least of it. It definitely shouldn't have been titled ""Fast and Furious 6"", it should be ""Chasing Shaw"", which includes a hint of cars, but the main idea of this film. The acting. It was good. But, it didn't make me feel like I was there, to be honest, I felt the only scenes that blew my mind were the very visual ones that included stunts, action, or humor, but otherwise I felt it was to..to self-centered on the plot, (MUCH different than what I expected) where the characters weren't able to do what they were meant to, and it made a big impact on the movie.In conclusion, Fast & Furious 6 was an outstanding film with some flaws that definitely effect my opinion, but yet I do encourage you to see the film yourself. Most people liked it much more than I did, and with the box office total just for the past few days, I think that you would like it as well as mostly everyone else.",jagsports01,2013-05-28,2013
81,8.0,What a great surprise!,"I'm a big fan of the Fast & Furious franchise, but since the last movie (Rio) i was like ""it's a good action movie, but it had lost its essence"". Now, after watching F&F 6, i've the feeling that one part of the original story is back. The cars have a bigger role (now they can be called secondary characters), but still isn't the same as F&F , F&F 2 and F&F Tokio. All the characters (specially Dom, Brian, Hobbs and Letty) were well created, respecting their origins and explaining some important details from the past movies. I've rated 8 for some reasons: 1) action sequences that goes against gravity in so many ways; 2) it's a little too long; 3) the cars and races still have a secondary role.In general it's a great action movie, with a good plot, nice races, really funny (thanks Roman!) and exciting. If you're a big fan of F&F, why haven't you watched yet?? If you're not a fan, but like action movies, i strongly recommend it!Hope this review helps!",lucena-neto,2013-05-25,2013
82,7.0,The coolest gang is back !,"Following Fast Five and its post-credit scene, this was the most hyped summer movie. And it did justify it somewhat, with me being edged to the seat throughout its 130 minute run.Its different from any other action series for having a gang that is family and has a code, primarily laid out by Dom. It increases its grip by nostalgic moments from its prequels (""We Own It"") and is incredibly fast (amazing action sequences). Some of it is non-realistic, but we won't term it as no-brainy. Yes it does have its weak moments, but it'll still be termed as 'Must Watch'.Though best movie in the series still remains the 2001 original, this is pretty awesome.

Keeps you on the edge of the seat most of the time and at times takes you to totally relaxing mood, like coming back home.Action packed, fast paced with a touch of romance and giggles, Fast 6 opens up an entire new platform for explosive movies. Though you will find Vin Diesel getting older he still has got some good fights to enthrall you. Rock is as usual his best, you may wonder if he is just coming out of gym working out. There are 2 action sequences that you must not miss. And also the last 1 minute... and finally a piece of advice. Its one of the movies that you should not miss watching on the big screen, so don't wait for the DVDs/torrents to come out.

85,8.0,Kept me at the edge of my seat,"Although I'm not a hardcore fan of this franchise, I did watch all of its titles and frankly speaking this installment kept me at the edge of my seat for a good two hours of actions, except maybe for the somewhat lengthy and awkward but fortunately rare conversational scenes. I like the breath-taking and adrenaline rush of the 'unusual' car-chase scenes, which have already been revealed in the trailer, involving F1 cars, a tank and even a plane. As for the speed rush, you'll just have to watch it yourself. I also enjoyed the little bit of reminisce in classic scenes here and there, as well as some humorous scenes involving mostly Tyrese. Got to give it to him for the laughs.I don't mind the fact that there's more of Dwayne Johnson but I'm actually quite disappointed with Paul Walker's underplayed role. Vin Diesel could also use a bit more facial and non-verbal expressions. Overall I find it as one of the best installment of the franchise, and definitely a good watch if you're a typical action flick fan. 8 from me as it certainly tops my action movies list of the year, but pretty straight-forward and not quite yet to reach a 'legendary' status that movies like The Matrix and Rambo enjoys.Oh and special credits to the production team for the bridge scene and the teaser for the next installment (remember to stay seated when the credit starts to roll!)",tzmmalaysia,2013-05-27,2013

91,7.0,"Just for entertainment, nothing more","There is nothing I could say about ""Fast and Furious 6"" besides a fun movie with dumb storyline. I must admit that the action scenes in this movie is bigger and cooler than other previous series but in storyline, ""Fast Five"" is much better. ""Furious Six"" undeniably has more action sequences, car crashing and bigger explosions which is fun to see in the summer season. It's what all ""Fast and Furious"" fans expected to be. Besides that massive action stuff, there's nothing left you could expect from this movie. The quality of storyline is so bad and dumb that makes this movie goes nowhere and no different from their previous franchise. The more you think, the more you feel silly about this movie. For example, the scenes when Brian pretending goes to jail for searching information about Letty that even their team and Toretto himself had already known about it before Brian told them, so what does he go to jail for? The cast in ""Furious Six"" are also flat and standard. As Indonesian people, I'm really proud of Joe Taslim for his first Hollywood movie debut. I know that he doesn't speak much but it's just enjoyable to see him fighting and taking quite important role. Overall, ""Furious Six"" is kind of good movie to see this summer and one of the great one from the series. But if you're searching for a good quality movie with strong storyline, it's not that kind of movie.",aldri-feb,2013-05-23,2013

96,8.0,Contains what we loved from the first movies....Street racing!,"After many years, won't the ""Fast and Furious"" makers give up the series. They have always wanted to keep their fans close and updated, by making more movies. The problem by making more movies to a series, is that they always have to bring something new to the movie. They get fewer new ideas, and end often by ""copying"" another movie from the series and make it a bit different. Those movies get hated and sells bad. But in the 6th movie of the ""Fast and Furious"" series, they give us something old and new, and it's exciting at the same time. In the 5th movie there were more action and a lack of street racing. In the 6th movie they've tried to go back to the street racing, and they succeeded! I felt like I was back in the first movies, the cars, the noises, hell yeah even the chicks were back! They even tried to combine both street racing and the action, WHICH was not a disappointment at all! The story is simple, stop the bad guys from doing something bad, but even if the story is that simple, it's pretty good told. There is always something that happens that will keep you focused. The effects are really great. There is nothing that is half done. Every actors and actresses play their roles excellent, especially hilarious Tyrese Gibson and the leading Vin Diesel.In short, the movie is great! I will recommend it for everybody that loves a good action movie, and for those who are big fans to the ""Fast and Furious"" movies.

After it had achieved takeoff speed, it was still struggling to take off for the next, what, 15 minutes? Was that run strip really 50 miles long?

99,7.0,Furious entertainment unleashed by cars and stars,"You won't queue up for it's first show. You won't gather a group of 10 friends to go watch it on Saturday evening. You won't spend extra on 3D and IMAX ever on this series but you will surely buy some popcorn because 'Fast and Furious' is one of the most entertaining franchises ever. By now, you know what to expect in terms of some sizable destruction of cars and assets, stunts that defy laws of physics and the scorching pace at which you can drive through densely populated cities. None of which is possible in reality but yet, there is something about this group that makes you want it to be real. Justin Lin has directed 3 of the more memorable F&F movies and this time too, he gets the combination accurately with just the right amount of hot women, sexy cars and high octane action. Buckle up for this fun ride. The opening sequence seems like a James Bond movie with a Dodge Challenger and Nissan Skyline racing along the Spanish coast, reflecting the carefree lives of now millionaires, Dominic and Brian. Shortly thereafter, Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) surprises Dominic with a visit and a motive (Letty lives!) to join forces to crackdown on Owen Shaw (Luke Evans)'s mercenaries who have performed a series of audacious heists to assemble a devastating weapon. Hobbs attempts to re-unite the team to take on Shaw on the street level and win full pardons for their past crimes. The action proceeds onto London's streets with Dom and Brian in hot pursuit of Shaw's mercenaries. Thereafter, Dom and his blast from the past, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) scorch the streets of London in an epic race that leads to the revelation that she survived the explosion a few movies ago but lost her memory. Shaw was the one who rescued her and hired her as his top mercenary. Following such an emotionally pleasing scene, we move on to Spain where the components of the Nightshade device are being transported to a secure location but the convoy is brutally attacked by Shaw's forces who also tear through the oncoming traffic in a tank along the highway. The team defy the laws of physics, create more destruction than some Decepticons and save each other in the name of being a family. The climactic action is on a never-ending military runway with the massive bomber aircraft being kept on ground by a handful of super-cars and heroes. The inaneness of the action is jarring but the actors make it all entertaining by giving their best in every ridiculous scene. One can also credit Lin for reviving these characters in 'Fast Five' and adding some richness to their bond to make us feel for them every time they defy physics. Justin Lin's fourth F&F venture is a super-charged engine aptly titled 'Furious 6' for it takes action, storyline, characterization and vehicular warfare to a higher level. As ridiculous as they may sometimes be, the sequences are bigger and more explosive with actors partaking in most of them. Hundreds of cars are sacrificed in the devastation that follows this team in their pursuit of Shaw and in their journey, we are given a better insight into their characters. When your expectations for a silly engine revving franchise are modest, the cars and humans can provide quite a rush of entertainment. Dwayne Johnson looks like the Hulk. He can only fit into army grade vehicles including the Hummer now but with G.I.Joe and F&F franchises, he's made his mark in the genre as the massive Rock of action. Vin Diesel's career is all about Dominic Toretto now. With few dialogues and more stunts, his talent is optimized by this franchise. Paul Walker could've been an unknown were it not for his partnership with Diesel in their car chases. With fewer dialogues and subtle emotions of being a father, Walker does justice to his role and no more. Michelle Rodriguez is badass in this film. Apart from some MMA fighting with Gina Carano, Letty also gets to shoot and drive some while her character gets a grasp of her past and present. Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous are funny but limited in exposure on screen. Luke Evans poses as quite a formidable villain, but we do not get to see much of his ruthless aggression since most of it is manifested in the manner of tanks and flip cars that create the destruction. Oh and please bring Gal Gadot back.... please.With some crazy car chases in London and physics defying sequences in Spain and the airstrip, Fast & Furious 6 packs quite a few horses to satiate the enthusiast. The plot is typical and is played out in banal fashion with occasionally cheeky dialogues. But that's not the point of this franchise. It's the super-cars, women, action and hip hop music that the protagonists roll out to in the drag race arena that will bring you back for more.... Speaking of which, there's a nice cliff-hanger to F&F 7 after the end so remain seated with the belts still on.7.853 on a scale of 1-10.",kunalkhandwala,2013-06-01,2013
100,6.0,"It is what it is - 5,9/10","Fast & Furious 6, what can I say? I mean, my expectations were really low and boy were they met. I'm not saying the type of low like ""This is going to be bad"", more like ""Hmm, I might give this a shot"". The director Justin Lin doesn't try to do anything else other than sticking to the trashy film that it is, and I would give him and the movie credit for that. But more? Nope, I think people are giving it too much credit for that. Sure, there were some ""good"" trashy action set-pieces in there, some muscle(cars), a tank, big guns, and... Nothing more. Maybe Vin Diesel flying across a very big gap between two bridges to save Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and landing on a car breaking the laws of physics - why? Because ""She is family, and family stick together, you don't turn your back on them even if they do"", or something. One thing maybe worth mentioning are the physical performances by everyone in the movie, especially the ladies.Everything ""good"" that was in the movie was already in the trailer, so what I ended up doing was just waiting for the scenes to pass by. There was a sequence in it where they had to drive after an airplane, and then they actually brought it down with some hooks and whatnot. That sequence goes on for about 15 minutes, which means that the runway must've been very, very long. And of course after that sequence they get to the end of the runway. A lot of innocent people also died in the scene with the tank (where it just runs over random cars with unimportant people in them).A lot of people did laugh, and they laughed a lot. The only thing that made me chuckle was probably The Rock himself just him being there. The only time I actually laughed was when the title ""Furious 6"" (If you have seen the movie you'll know which one I mean) came up because some guy in the back shouted ""6 Furious"". And I am not joking when I tell you that it was the only time during the movie that I actually laughed.This movie left me very uninterested and bored because of the plot, story, badly written characters and the dumb dialogues. I couldn't enjoy the big action set-pieces because I was so bored. So in general, this is a boring movie in every kind of way. And the fact that people in the audience gave a it big round of applause after the movie ended just made me wanna stick my head in the sand.",yaldish,2013-05-24,2013

103,9.0,Fantastic movie from an almost died-out franchise,"We've all seen our favorite movies churn out those forgettable and often straight-to-video sequels; Death Race, Wrong Turn, Resident Evil. (Really, not Resident Evil???). And with The Fast and the Furious series, you were starting to see the decline after 2 and most definitely 3. So for Justin Lin to bring back this series from the dead, even to use the weird sequels as a part of the story in his new trilogy, is incredibly impressive.As for Furious Six, I thought it was incredibly enjoyable. Few movies are actually this fun to watch. The action felt very well paced, never dragging on or repetitious in any way. The dialogue was humorous and the story was very interesting to see played out.I feel like the only movie I could compare this to is Transformers 3. Coming from a series that I felt like was convoluted and ""missing the point"" of a fun action film, Transformers 3 and Furious Six alike really meet what they were striving for. An incredibly fun film.This next part is mainly for people who have seen the movie already, though not a spoiler.I've seen a few reviews that say that last action packed scene in the film's climax was too much and could have been cut. I could not disagree more. I feel like the filmmaker mislead everyone to think everything was fine and dandy, all wrapped up, but I could not help but feel that the action was over too abruptly, and I still needed to see more. And then there is that last, incredibly epic action scene. The filmmakers made me feel like I needed to see more, so that they could deliver that last scene specifically for me. Great filmmaking, great film. Very impressed.",Ginnysababe,2013-06-09,2013
104,7.0,Lots of action but too much punching and kicking,This is a grand and extravagant looking production. The exotic locations are good. The car vs car action is what you'd expect and doesn't disappoint. Things go even further with tanks and planes. The car race in London was a bit artificially sped up. Who knew tanks could drive so fast. The attempts at humor are weak and mostly unfunny. But who care if some things are unreal thats part of the charm.Sadly the cast has aged. Paul is looking older = needs to stay out of the sun. Vin looks a little flabby. The Rock looked a bit too pumped up. Doesn't he know steroids are out now. The long drawn out obsession with Michelle Rodriguez's character is a bit tiresome. Jordanna is looking a bit gaunt. Luke Evans as the villain is a bit forgettable.Can there be too much action in a movie like this? In a way yes. The punching and fighting has come to equal the vehicular action. Enough of the fighting and punching back and forth! I know they had to use Gina Carano's skills but it felt like overkill. You can see that in any other action movie. Felt like a Hong Kong action flick.Overall things are quite grand and large scale especially looking back to the earlier ones in the series. Worth a watch.,phd_travel,2013-05-30,2013

108,7.0,Every sequel has been a little better than the last!,"'FAST & FURIOUS 6': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The sixth installment in the ever-popular action movie franchise brings back all the stars from the previous films including Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Paul Walker, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Sung Kang, Jordana Brewster, Gal Gadot and even Michelle Rodriguez (who's character was killed off two films ago). MMA champion (and rising female action star) Gina Carano (of 'HAYWIRE' fame) and Luke Evans also join the cast this time around. Justin Lin (who directed the last three sequels as well) returns as director and Chris Morgan (who wrote the last three installments) returns as the film's writer. This chapter has DSS agent Luke Hobbs tracking down Dominic Toretto and his team to enlist the gang's help in bringing down a team of deadly mercenary drivers. Toretto reluctantly agrees to help Hobbs when he discovers his old love, he thought was dead, is still alive and working with the team of mercenaries. The film is of course bigger and more action packed than ever and delivers everything die-hard fans of the series have come to expect.The movie begins with Dom (Diesel), Brian (Walker) and the rest of the car racing crew living around the world, on the lam, while spending the $100 million loot they scored in their Rio heist (at the end of the last film). Hobbs (Johnson), now working with his new partner Riley (Carano), tracks down Dom and convinces him to help him capture a team of mercenary drivers led by an ex-British Special Forces soldier named Owen Shaw (Evans). Hobbs offers Dom and his team full pardons if they help him stop Shaw but it's the info that Dom's ex-love Letty (Rodriguez) is still alive that persuades him into doing the job. Action and carnage ensue.I was never a huge fan of the original 2001 hit but I've liked each sequel a little more ever since (although I still haven't seen 'TOKYO DRIFT'). I think the franchise got a lot better with the last chapter when it added 'The Rock' into the mix. That's when box office for the series really skyrocketed and it also reached it's critical acclaim peak; how many movie series can one say that about (I can't think of any). It's great that this film added Carano as well and they also add another big action star at the end, in a post-credits scene, that should build even more anticipation for the next film in the series (which is already planned for next year). The franchise is still just a series of brainless action scenes strung together with no real plot or involving character development but they do keep getting more and more spectacular. This film does have some amazing car chases once again (including one involving a tank) but it still couldn't top the best car chase of the year (or just about any year) from another long running action movie franchise: 'A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD'.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge23zs5RPrM",Hellmant,2013-05-29,2013

110,7.0,vertigo thrilling stronger sequel,"pretty good movie that would force you to sit straight and upright through the whole nine yards when it played on. yes, rarely a title possessed franchise could be this good, there were TV episode-like movies like 007 or mission impossible, but some of them just felt weak, either affected by weak screenplays, bad directors or newly replaced main characters, but fast and furious seems to not only be able to maintain the quality of each one, it is actually getting better and better. the last Brazilian heist was a rarely accomplishment with bolder and crazier scenario but turned out to be very thrilling. if you think dragging and pulling a huge bank vault around citywide in a firefight is crazy, watch this new one, tank, cargo plan, fast cars....you might need to take some tranquilizers to calm down your nerves and resettle your blood pressure after you back home from the theater. and again, you'll see some highly unlikely scenes in this movie like any other fast and furious movies: after digged a Russian made high power military standard bullet out of his right front should-chest area, the guy never needed to recuperated and didn't need any blood infusion, just wrapped up and beating his opponents like nothing happened. an at least over several tons super tank could drive as fast as all the fast cars and crashed them like eggs. the high speed of the tank on the freeway was some scene that i simply could not believe at all. then the firefight on the runway inside a cargo plane. well, since it carried out so over-the-top crazy, i have nothing to say no more. this is indeed a crazy movie but nobody won't dislike it.",rightwingisevil,2013-05-19,2013

117,7.0,The Best Fast & Furious Yet!,"Never have been a fan of this series, but after seeing the trailers and hearing some positive things, I decided to give this one a shot. And ya know what? I actually had a pretty fun time. I like the direction Justin Lin took with this one just making it big and stupid, but totally self-aware of what it is. The action set-pieces are an absolute blast to watch with each one topping the previous one before it. The last 2 scenes are worth the price of admission alone. I also enjoyed the chemistry between all the actors which added a surprising amount of laughs to the film. Still, the film has plenty of flaws that the series has shared. There is a bit too much down time in the middle where the film starts to drag when it begins to build on it's incredibly thin story. There's also some moments of dialogue that are so poorly written it's hard not to notice them. Overall, while it's not great by any means, I would defiantly say that this is my favorite of the series so far (although that's not saying much). Nothing special or all that memorable, but as a summer popcorn flick, it gets the job done. Fans of the series will most likely love it while even the non-fans will still be able to have some fun with it. I do have to admit though after the post-credit scene, I would be lying if I said I wasn't incredibly excited for the 7th installment!",Rebel_With_A_Cause_94,2013-06-01,2013

130,6.0,The Vidiot Reviews,"Fast & Furious 6The best way to curb street racing in your community is to generate constant gridlock.Mind you, the racers in this action movie are inclined to go off-road.Dominic (Vin Diesel) comes out of hiding to help DSS agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) stop a rogue solider (Luke Evans) from selling an EMP on the black market.In exchange, he and his crew (Paul Walker, Gal Gadot, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Tyrese Gibson, Chris Bridges) want amnesty for their US crimes and the freedom to return home.The fifth sequel in the series, Fast 6 doesn't dazzle like its predecessor Fast 5 but it does maintain the franchise's new espionage angle.And while street racing takes a back seat in this one, there are enough overblown car- chases, unexpected cameos and sudsy melodrama to propel the series onward.But, as always, this series ignores the real victims of street racing: ran-over flag-girls.

Despite being completely ridiculous in some spots, especially the long climax scene. But in spite of this, the film is satisfyingly entertaining and at times thrilling. The performances from all of the cast are good , if a little hammy in places. Some of the banter between Chris Bridge's and Tyrese Gibson's characters gave the film some comic moments. Fast 6 doesn't live long in the memory but it's good fun while it lasts , despite being a tiny bit too long.Overall this is a solid entry into the fast & Furious franchise that will keep you entertained throughout.6/10",ginga145,2013-06-14,2013
133,6.0,Bring back the nostalgia,"The original F&F1 sparked the import scene in North America, with at the time seemingly accurate depictions of street cars and performance modifications. The movie was a car film in and out and as another user stated each movie has been getting progressively worse, this evident with the sixth instalment of the fast and the furious.Fast and the furious movies need Performance import cars that the common man can relate too, anything else could be lacking and the film would be just as nostalgic as the first movie. It really is sad to see where it came from and where it is now, I will not be watching the seventh if that so happens and I advise everyone from doing the same. Unless you couldn't give two flux about cars then watch it for Vin diesels boobs and a bullshit storyline.Bring back the nostalgia and RIP Paul Walker.",loganbentley,2013-12-10,2013

I like visual effects but when they used in moderation and not in a hole movie.Finally I want to tell you that in ""Fast Five"" I liked the interpretations of Paul Walker (Brian O'Conner), Dwayne Johnson (Hobbs) and Sung Kang (Han).",Thanos_Alfie,2013-11-19,2013

I had Hobbs' new partner tagged as a traitor from the second she came on screen, that one was WAY too easy to see. Also, the second that Dom and Brian left Mia alone with the baby, it was obvious that Shaw was going after her to use as a hostage (that was easy to see as well). I thought it was also easy to see that one of the team was going to die, although I did have Han pegged as the obvious choice, I didn't see Han AND Gisele both dying. I liked the action and the stunts, even if they were sometimes ridiculous (it IS a Fast & Furious movie, the stunts are always going to be ridiculous).

157,8.0,The 'Fast & Furious' franchise getting better and better,"I think it's getting better and better after 'Fast Five', since the introduction of Dwayne Johnson into the franchise. After stylish 'Tokyo Drift' I loved very much this and one before it from the series. There were not many movie series that pulled the franchise from average to awesome like this one did so the credit goes to the writers and director as well as the actors.As expected finally the action babe arrived, Gina Carano. After seeing her in 'Haywire' I thought she would be next Lara Croft. I mean the next big action lady, the one after Angelina Jolie but not as I expected role though okay. There was a death of one of a main character in the movie, I kinda doubt that because of surprise re-entry of Michelle Rodriguez into the series.It was a well written script, engaging characters except one scene where Dwayne Johnson and another actor who make a British man go stripped. The movie missed having some nice action sequences from the Dwayne Johnson a little let down from that perspective. But the rest of the stunts were breathtaking. Who cares whether it is graphic are real I just enjoyed especially the final one with the aircraft which long lasts for over 20 minutes. I guess there won't be that long runway anywhere in the world :p. The movie will be more enjoyable by hardcore action movie fans so why don't you try if you have not seen yet.7.5/10",Reno-Rangan,2013-11-16,2013
158,7.0,Never a bad thing when a franchise can get better and better every movie.,"Wow. Fast 6. Six! And there's gonna be a seventh one too! The fast and furious franchise has never been a real favorite of mine. Since I'm in 8th grade however, I do enjoy a good turn- your-brain-off film that is oozing male testosterone from every corner, whether it's big guns, explosions, hot chicks, or body builders crashing into each other with cars. Despite all this, I've never really been a fan of the franchise until it's 5th release. Directed by Justin Lin, it was the first well shot, well paced flick of the franchise. Although it was dumb, I had a ton of fun with it. So this new one was what I needed to kick off the summer blockbuster season. And it did just that. It was still pretty stupid. The acting, overall, was pretty bad too, but there were surprisingly some pretty great performances and dialogue between some of the main characters, which was actually somewhat enjoyable and funny. Probably funnier than the actual ""comedy"" opening right alongside this one, The Hangover Part 3. The thing I enjoy most about these films, though, is the stunt work combined with pretty decent special effects. These movies are so over the top but the it's good to know that although the plot to these things aren't well thought out, the technical aspect of it all is stellar, and some of these scenes, especially with some friends, can be a blast once you see them. This movie gets so over the top that it takes away from what I liked about fast five so much: how tension built up to the unbelievable action sequence at the end. This time around, Lin puts in so much action that there's literally no room to breathe. This is why I'm still debating whether fast five or fast six was better. Fast Six definitely had a better clan, but the steady pacing in five makes me like the 2011 release a little more. It still does not change the fact that fast Six is so fun to watch. I'd say, ignore the critics and take this movie for what it is: dumb manliness portrayed on film. This movie is loads of fun. 73/100",TheSoFlyGuy1359,2013-05-25,2013

160,7.0,"Good action movie, but doesn't fully live up to its past","I am a a big fan of the Fast and Furious franchise, I own them all. Typically I rank them according to my beliefs as to how well they were done. In my mind, from best to worst: 5,4,1,3, and 2. When I look at Fast 6, I would have to put it somewhere between 4 and 1.Here's why I think this: the Fast and Furious franchise was based on the premise of fast, gorgeous cars and the shades of gray between good and bad, mostly marketed towards the gear head segment of the population. With Fast 5, we see that they are now trying to re-brand the franchise as a heist series with cars as the central method for pulling off these heists. Fast 5 did this spectacularly in my opinion, but Fast 6 was a step down. First of all, the cars were not given as much emphasis as even Fast 5 did. The fact that many of the driving sequences in this movie happen at night and the cars are mainly painted dark colors shows a distinct movement away from the car culture that made the series so popular.Secondly, this movie seems to try too hard to be funny at times. In the previous movie, there was a definite light-heartedness about the characters and their banter, but in Fast 6 the humor is not that funny and tends to be forced into inappropriate times and places.Bottom line: if you go to this movie expecting it to be a perfect continuation of the excellence of the previous movie you will be disappointed. However, if you go to see beautiful cars crash, things blow up, and epic fistfights this is the summer movie for you.",regula1,2013-05-24,2013

Why spend all their time customising and tuning the cars if they could easily steal a tiny little cop car :). This is the case in loads of pursuits in movies and it really annoys me. On the other hand, Furious 6 has a nice storyline, and the London surroundings give movie a nice Classy touch to it... Furthermore, the whole cast from the original movie is pretty much together again and they put on a decent performance, teaming up with The Rock.Back to the level of the first movies if you ask me.",cybercooky,2013-09-05,2013
163,6.0,Too Fast To Remember...,"FAST AND FURIOUS 6 is the sixth film in the Fast & Furious franchise. It's directed by Justin Lin, starring Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez and MANY more.The film starts off with Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) approaching Dom (Vin Diesel) about a case involving Shaw (Luke Evans) and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) who was assumed dead in the 4th segment of the series.NOTE: This review is written by a Fast & Furious fan.SO, the trailer of Fast & Furious 6 was everywhere by the time it came out and it literally caught everyone's attention, whether they were a fan or not. I, as usual, booked my ticket for the movie and hoped for the best... which isn't what I got.Now this is quite hard to explain, so I'll do my best. According to me, this film is great, no doubt. It has the fast cars, the hot chicks, the action, yet it is quite forgettable. Now, I've seen Fast & Furious 6 twice, so far, and I've tried my best to engross myself into the film, but FF6 fails to do that for me. It's like, a chase sequence will take place, and 20 minutes later, you try your best to remember what happened during that very sequence. So, to me, it has all the elements of a Fast & Furious film, yet, it fails to captivate and by the time you leave the cinema and reach home, the film just remains faintly in your head.Second problem of the film is: WHERE ARE THE CHASE SCENES? Oh my God, this is what makes a Fast & Furious film, and yet there were only 4 of them in this one. Alright, one involves a tank, and another involves an airplane, yet it does not suffice, compared to the earlier Fast Five which had plenty of chase scenes to get you engrossed in the film.But apart from the flaws, Fast & Furious 6 does have some enjoyable parts, like whenever there is an action or chase scene, it is quite fun. The comedy is quite entertaining at times and the post-credits scene is quite a cliff-hanger, involving a star who is going to make a great villain to Fast & Furious 7.In conclusion, I feel Fast & Furious 6 is half-baked. Honestly, from a Fast & Furious fan, its quite sad to say this, but FF6 doesn't hold a chance compared to Fast Five. It is fun at times, yet its extremely forgettable which makes it quite difficult to focus your attention on the screen.FAST & FURIOUS 6: 6/10",andre_rox99,2013-06-08,2013
164,6.0,Some thoughts...,"I'll refrain from breaking down the entire film for you given that you've either seen it or are curious about watching it. So instead I'll just hit what I considered a few of the movies strong points and not so strong points.THE GOOD: The tank scene was surprisingly awesome to watch. I didn't expect the carnage they actually showed in the film, given it was a popcorn movie. The hand to hand fight scenes were also quite well done (most notably in the train station). Obviously the movie had tons of car chases that were well handled.THE BAD: The story was very weak. So tell me again why Diesel's team is the only group of people that can take down this bad guy? It's like they predicted that there would be tons of car chases. Why would you even assume that? Besides lots of plot issues the dialogue itself was a bit hard to get through. I will say that Tyrese's character was the high point of the film for me. Thank goodness he had his little quirk. It was definitely nothing special, but if you like the franchise you'll enjoy the movie. Not one I would necessarily recommend tho.",artistgp,2013-06-07,2013

169,10.0,very good,"Movie was up to the mark. There were lot of hilarious moments. Rock was excellent in the movie. All the characters gel up really well. Letty is back :D. The movie was fast and furious. The scene with the airplane in the climax is one of the highlights of the movie. I will give this a 10/10 rating right away. Don't miss it. go and watch it right away. I am very eager for the next installment now. the film is filled with all the high-octane speed chases and close combat scenes we've come to expect from the franchise. I think this is one of the best film in the franchise. As is the trend nowadays, the closing credits provide a teaser of what's to come. In a Tokyo-set interlude we are introduced to yet another popular action star who will likely join the fast and furious crew for joyride number seven. Keep those seat belts fastened. Fast & Furious 6 is back to wheel power.",varma333,2013-05-25,2013
170,7.0,I'm going to be very straightforward,"I'm usually descriptive in my reviews, but I'm not going to do that for this movie. This movie is simple entertainment. It does not require any brain power to understand the storyline in this movie. Beautiful cars. Beautiful girls. Hunky men. Yeap. Epic.The second you start using your brain while watching the movie, you start noticing the idiocy that had taken place. For instance, how huge will Dwayne Johnson go before he just turns from the Rock into the Boulder?Also, at the very last scene, how long is the damn runway? I mean seriously?Regardless, I still enjoyed the movie. It entertained me, and as a petrol head, this movie is definitely enjoyable.Should you watch it? Yeah, why not.",bugus92,2013-07-08,2013
171,2.0,Gone in 60 Secs...,"This movie should have been called Gone in 60 secs because that's when i felt like leaving. I'm giving this movie a 2 star rating because it was pretty cool when the 2 semi's crashed on the highway and exploded in slow-motion. Otherwise this franchise seems to have died off long ago. Its no longer about the cars and racing, but horrible subplots about people id rather see written off then saved. Paul Walker is as bad as ever, but good thing is he was barely in this. Vin Diesel is getting to old to act and its showing. The rock also seem's juiced up like always. Paul Walker is so bad i wanted to say it twice. If you are familiar with the newer Mission Impossible movies then you've pretty much already know the story. I would rather XXX then this POS. I still don't understand how the series has gone so very wrong since the 1st film was only half bad. You know how at the end of the 1st one... where Vin Diesel flips the cool classic car? I really wish it had landed on top of Paul Walker's car and killed them so this movie would have never existed.",wtfboomheadshot1337,2013-06-06,2013

176,6.0,Fast & Furious 6,"Watched this one in the local multiplex, honestly I am not an avid fanboy of this money-maker franchise, I am even not an advocate of racing vehicles, but the turning point comes when FAST FIVE (2011, 7/10) surprisingly catapults itself into a new level of sensory entertainment with its roller coaster ride and triumphantly revives the series' mass appeal to a younger generation and has grossed a series-high income means it has yet overstayed its welcome. Still helmed by Justin Lin, this 6th sequel reunites all the cast, including one of the ""original four"" Michelle Rodriguez, whose wacky insomnia and vague backstory stirs the most untenable veneer of the plot if one can excuse the physics-defying action sequences as an utmost drawing power to allure new genre lovers and retain its core audiences. So a large drawback of this one is it is solely made for one's eyes only, one should completely ignore what is the convoluted plot going on by the villain and his cohorts and plainly indulge oneself in the great stunt work to find it is worth your ticket. Unequivocally it is a tough job for any writer to create new blood for the franchise since it allows very limited leeway to inspire from the original cast, and due to the aesthetic fatigue, sooner or later, a younger cast must be mustered so as to invigorate a healthy metabolism for the faded set pieces. In this one, the newcomer is a strapping Luke Evans as the main villain, whose temperament presages a brighter future as a leading man candidate in world cinema, but unfortunately this film is not his breakthrough, at most a stepping stone permits him to be seen by more people and hence enlarges his fan base. Everyone else is pigeonholed with their respective task, Johnson bullies scumbags, Diesel emotionlessly sweet-talks with his comeback battle-axe, Walker retreats into a family man, Gibson and Ludicrous are the pair of cutups, the ass-kicking martial pro Carano is here for girl fights while Kang and Gadot cannot run away from their functional exit, which plausibly introduce another bankable name as the next villain for the next chapter, due next year and will be transferred to be under the reign of horror-genre whiz James Wan, let's pray for a miracle to sustain its longevity and if we are lucky enough, a better one next time!",lasttimeisaw,2013-07-31,2013

178,7.0,Justin Lin's Fast & Furious 6 (2013),"Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his friends are chillin' all over the globe, enjoying la dolce vita, after their successful heist in Fast Five (2011). However they're also longing to return home to America. Agent Hobbs (The Rock) offers them the opportunity to do just that: A clean slate in exchange for one last job. The mission includes taking down a villainous character (Luke Evans) in London, finding Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and driving fast cars, while doing crazy stunts, shooting and beating people up and stuff.Justin Lin's fourth entry in the franchise is mostly successful, thanks to an amiable cast, a cheesy, but sweet writing and some breathtaking action set pieces. The characters mostly derive from the actor's screen persona, which is not a bad thing per se, but some of the acting is stale and the screenplay doesn't really allow for much room for them to breathe and develop in a satisfying way. The action is very intense and interestingly shot in some instances, though you can sustain tension only so long, and so the last act results a bit too long. The film in general could use some leaner editing. Some scenes are basically useless, like Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) going to prison. Gina Carano's wrestling skills are impressive, but her character's twist at the end is completely pointless.Personally, I am biased to like this film, for purely nostalgic reasons: I grew up with this franchise. The film had me from the very beginning with the great opening title montage. In my estimation this is one of the few interesting franchises out there today. Borrowing too much from last year's box office hits The Avengers (exploiting the team of ""superheroes"" aspect, featuring a ""similar"" villain and also copying structural elements) and The Dark Knight franchise (the villain seems to be driving something out of a Christopher Nolan film); Furious 6 could have been better by doing its own thing like in the previous installment. The villain and his motivations are dubious and weakly executed. The result is a formulaic story. To its credit Furious 6 has a good sense of humor, but also a beautiful message about the importance of family. What I disliked was how some characters were treated, namely Roman (Tyrese Gibson) being reduced to comic relief, Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) hardly given anything to do and Elena (Elsa Pataky) completely ignored up until the end. The potential conflict between Dom's new girlfriend Giselle (Gal Gadot) and Letty also remained unexplored. The film ends on an upbeat note, but I just have a hard time buying that Brian is a father now. Stay tuned for more action to come – #7 was already announced.Verdict: Recommended. Especially if you're an action junkie, love the Fast & Furious franchise or just enjoy having Corona with your buddies and turn off your brain for 2 hours.",TheDelusionist,2013-05-31,2013
179,9.0,"Fast Five reignited this series, Fast & Furious 6 has taken it even further.","The Fast & Furious series has seen some good times and not so good times. The series has been up and down since The Fast and the Furious released in 2001, and seems to have finally decided on a permanent name for the series. When 2011's Fast Five ushered in a new vision of the franchise, brought huge success and now Fast & Furious 6 has driven that success to heights I never thought I'd see in this series.This series is really supposed to be about two things: fast cars and furious action (pun absolutely intended) and this movie provides both on a large scale. Though some of the action scenes are a bit unrealistic and clichéd, they are intense and exciting enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. High speed highway chases, big time shootouts, and some excellent hand-to-hand combat are all in full effect here and make for some very entertaining action sequences. A little more on the fisticuffs, they really were quite exciting and very well choreographed. The build up to the eventual showdown between two female characters and two juggernauts is fun and the clashes are great. The cars and other vehicles in the movie are fast paced and never leave a dull moment where something is dragged out (except for the end of the movie). So again, some of the action scenes are clichéd and predictable, but are overall a joy to watch.Now the plot and the villain. The story again revolves around Dominic Toretto and his crew who accept one last job to ensure their freedom. Things go awry, and the crew is forced into a much larger conflict than originally expected. The story takes some unexpected turns and keeps you interested for the vast majority, but at times was a little too rushed and got confusing. It wasn't the best story in an action movie I've ever seen, but it wasn't the worst either. The movie's romantic sub plot involving Dominic and Letty was good. It never made you bored and added to the emotional side a little bit. The villain, Owen Shaw, is a good antagonist. At first, he doesn't seem to pose a huge threat and is sometimes boring to get into, but eventually really shows his dark side making up for his lack of character development in the early parts of the film. The cast is great. Vin Disel (Toretto), Paul Walker (Brain O'Conner), Dwayne Johnson (Hobbs), and Luke Evans (Shaw) among many other do a great job of bringing the movie to life. Some of the supporting cast such as Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous bring a solid slate of humor to keep the film fresh while Michelle Rodriguez (Letty) and Gina Carano (Riley) provide strong female roles that aren't often seen in action films. A shout out as well to director Justin Lin, who has taken an almost dead series after Tokyo Drift and reinvented it into the fast-paced action- heavy movies we again know.I love this series. The Fast and the Furious was a highly entertaining film while the next two movies were weak. Fast & Furious in 2009 was a step up and then again, Fast Five was a new and improved direction for the series which spanned F&F6 and the already announced Fast & Furious 7 slated for a July 2014 release. This movie may at times suffer from minor cases of clichés (and the longest runway in film history), but the top heavy action sequences, highlighted by terrific fight scenes and fast paced vehicular mayhem, plentiful and entertaining humor, great cast and acceptable story more than make up for those corny parts. The Fast & Furious series (which is hopefully the name they're sticking to), is back on the map and at top form. An end credits scene connects the dots between Tokyo Drift and the since announced Fast & Furious 7, so stick around to build up even more hype for next summer's big blockbuster.8.5/10 (my score is rounded to 9 on the website's rating)",slicedbread117,2013-08-29,2013

If the next one, fast 7 is like this, its going to be the biggest disappointment. to the greatest movie ever made.they need to bring it back to LA where it all began. and stay there. No more long as gun fights, planes, tanks. all that stuff.

So if you have a problem with that don't waste your time. But if you can sit back and enjoy a good action movie without giving to much credit to those scenes then you're up for a kick ass time with Fast and Furious 6. The characters are very good and keeping ""The Rock"" on the movie is very positive. I think he makes a great duo with Vin Diesel. The story isn't very elaborate, and that's the way it should be in this type of movie, but it deliver's. Fast and Furious 6 is one of the best action movies around these days, so give it a shot. 7 out of 10 !",beyonder-3,2013-09-17,2013
187,8.0,Just when we thought that it couldn't get bigger,"""The Rock"" is not the only one who got bigger. The whole movie goes to a massive level never before seen in the franchise. The creators of this franchise must ask themselves with each movie: How do we make this bigger? Because is getting ridiculous how massive are the racing scenes on Furious 6 (yes, that's the title showed in the intro). Well, there are not exactly racing scenes on this one (safe for one), it their place the writer puts a lot of car chasing scenes. There are so much persecution scenes on this movie that every character suffers at least one big accident in which, of course, none of them gets hurt. Everyone survives accidents that could finish with all the nine lives of a cat, without a single scratch. Between that and sort scene on a bridge involving certain characters flying on the air, the phrase ""Oh common!"" is useless in this one. That said, it is clear that we are not talking about an Academy Award Winner movie. We are talking about the Die Hard of racing cars. All the car sequences are great, full with action and emotion. Every single fan is going to be pleased at the end of the film. The story is very simple. There is a bad guy. Letty is working with him. The crew must bring Letty back home. The truth is that it works. The focus point of the film is to discover how she survives and why she didn't came back home. At least I can say that they came up with a good explanation of how that happens. But it must be clear that everything here has been made to please the fans. In other words, there are some decisions made in this film that if you think about it you will probably be disappointed. So is better if you just enjoy the ride and don't think about it too much. The theme is the family. That's actually how (finally) the cast is feeling. On Fast Five there are characters knowing each other, but in this one everybody knows everybody. So they're one big family in the film and it is perceive as if they have become one big family outside the set. Even Hobbs feels like part of the family, even being a cop. The new guy is the villain, Sebastian Shaw (Luke Evans). He did a fine job and maybe that's because he is a good actor or because at last we have a bad guy who isn't a drug dealer. Shaw is more like a terrorist, so he is more memorable than the others. Universal Pictures has confirmed the seventh film for July 2014 release date. That means that, even when we got a close ending, if you stay 10 more seconds you will witness an extra scene. In that scene we close one character gap (sadly but at last), and we're introduced the new bad guy. And he makes an impression on both, ladies and men. With that scene the producers make a statement: Fast & Furious 7 will be bigger than this.",damh_frikinlater,2013-05-23,2013

The first hour and a half were quite good, and I didn't understand what the other reviewers were complaining about. It felt just like the other movies, and some parts were even better. But the last two action sequences were exaggerated.The good about Fast and Furious 6: All the members of the team were busy and had their parts. This is the first time that they were actually matched with a tough rivals. Luke Evans played his character well, and he had a crew that was physically tough, sophisticated and well equipped. The return of Letty is good thing as well. Michelle Rodriguez was perfect.The bad: The exaggerated last action sequences. It's not that Fast 5 had a credible last scene. It didn't have, but I didn't think about it when I was watching it. It was just fun. Here I found myself thinking 'this is too much'. Another think is Hobbs. I liked him in the fifth movie. Here I find him slightly annoying. And some fights in the end felt redundant.

208,6.0,Dom is at it again,"Having resurrected the series after the critically panned sequel – 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS - returning director Justin Lin rigs this sixth installment with an action packed cocktail of nitrous oxide and adrenalin; a perfectly blended chemical compound that will have you laughing out loud even as you clench your toes through the film's high-octane action sequences.Picking up where FAST 5 ended, US Diplomatic Security Service Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) grants fugitives Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and former FBI Agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) a full pardon if they help him take down criminal mastermind Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). Toretto is of course uninterested, until Hobbs reveals that Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is alive but working for Shaw. A far as the synopsis goes, that's all you need to know, because that's all there is to it. To be fair, the FAST & FURIOUS saga has always been about high speed races and chases and less about character development or a mindboggling story. And Like the preceding films, the background story in this sixth installment is literally in the back seat, with emphasis on the ride rather than the destination. Neither is FURIOUS 6 the type of film inclined towards rocket scientists or viewers searching for logic. George Smiley burrowing after a Soviet spy within MI6? No. Regular doses of humour, peppered with death-defying stunts? Yes, and there is a truck load of it and it comes at you just as the title promises. This, essentially, is what makes FURIOUS 6 subjectively indulgent, with or without the popcorn. However, there is food for thought and fans of the series could be split debating whether or not this film is the best in the series. Although Lin injects a fresh canister of cinematic nitro, this latest episode lacks a worthy antagonist even though this film has the largest character ensemble in the series. On that note, characters don't die and dead ones are brought back. While there is a timeline-unknotting-explanation for that, the fact remains that Shaw is heavily outnumbered, and it shows. After five globetrotting adventures, Dom's 'family' has increased in size with many characters reappearing from previous films. In addition, Hobbs is no longer an advisory and along with his team of Special Forces sharp-shooters, becomes Dom's souped-up armory on wheels. There are also issues with continuity amid rip-off moments from iconic action films (think Lethal WEAPON 3). Through all the vehicular carnage, characters can take a beating, and still appear unfazed and unharmed. This carries on till the final skirmish onboard a cargo plane on a take-off run, on what has to be the world's longest runway! Real pilots in the audience would probably wet themselves laughing. But despite its flaws, some even absurd, FAST & FURIOUS 6 is a high energy action movie and competently made. Fans are treated to having Rodriguez back and there is a whole subplot about her 'new' character. Tyrese Gibson is also back but this time, more than ever, serves one real purpose and that is to shoot out some well-timed one-liners. As a summer opener, it not only revs up the fun-o-meter but also hurtles past the competition as a lucrative action film franchise. Bruce Willis - kindly heed that last line. While it is unusual for sequels to get better with each release, the FAST & FURIOUS franchise seems to mature with age and there is a very strong suggestion of a seventh installment. An end credits scene confirms this with the introduction of a new character. Pay attention to the film's baldness joke and you might just figure out who joins the cast in the next movie. If you do, you might also win premier passes for FAST & FURIOUS 7!",LloydBayer,2013-09-08,2013
211,1.0,You will love this movie... if you're 12 years old,"I got suckered/tricked into watching this movie with friends, otherwise I would never have watched it. I quit watching the F&F series after the second movie; so I haven't seen parts 3,4 and 5.The whole concept and the plot of these movies are of course completely ridiculous. But obviously many people don't care about that. At the time of writing this movie has a rating of 7,7 at IMDb. This high rating can easily be explained. Since it's part 6 of the series, most people know what to expect. People who don't like the previous parts, will not bother to watch part 6. So I'm assuming mostly die hard F&F fans have watched it in the cinema and they have given the movie a high rating. You can't rate a movie if you haven't watched it...I won't go into details of the movie, but trust me, if you're an adult and not easily impressed by all things shiny, this movie is not for you. I watched this in an IMAX theater and still not a single action scene could impress me. Don't get me started on the plot, humor, dialogue etc.Since many people use IMDb ratings to find out whether a movie is any good, I have voted 1 out of 10; to offset the high ratings that a lot of F&F fans have given. Otherwise I might have given it a 2.",diniz-702-167623,2013-06-03,2013
212,7.0,ride on the 6th gear.....,"thumps up for Justin Lin...he captured the speeding cars tremendously...the action scenes were awesome.Plot was just OK for the movie.. Tyrese Gibson..created good humor cast performance was good...but diesel rocked. action scenes were played in a very nice and synchronized manner. Cars were out of the world .The plot was not that catchy ... the movie opens on a speeding scene between Vin diesel and Paul walker,speeding to Mia Toretto as she was on to deliver.the all were settled family man until Dwayne Johnson..seeks for their help to solve an on going military utilities robbery..the team of Vin agree's to help in the condition of his and his teams freedom ,he was also very desperate to know how his x girl friend Letty Ortiz was alive,this is the basic purpose of the movie.the plot of ff6 is very much related to fast and furious 4 and 3.so it will be better if you know the summary of both the movies THE TANK SCENE AND THE PLANE SCENE will rock u .. overall the movie worths your money..,nd will leave u exited for its next sequel..which stars Jason Statham..",asu-ray20,2013-05-29,2013
218,7.0,Exaggerated Villains....,"First of all, this movie is quite awesome, but not as good as Fast 5 which IMO is the best of all FF franchise. The plot is more simple with a predictable twist in the end. The story also serves for wrapping up all the FF series for a grand finale in FF7 so it loads with lots character and effort to tie those loose ends (but not convincing enough) in previous sequel and rearrange the series in order so we can see now that FF3 is actually the FF6. So no wonder, there are some unnecessary scenes (ie Connor meets Braga in jail) which make less portion of actions scenes.The FF team become more solid in this sequel, everyone has a good portion to show their character and role in the movie. I think Han & Gisele relationship here somehow is more subtle & memorable than ""it'a all about family"" excuses that Dom and others bragging about throughout the film.However, the villain team is under my expectation. They are not as Hobbs, Braga or others picture them to be. They don't look scary, mean or dangerous to me, they just look tense and a bit nervous, except Shaw and that big Russian guy. While Shaw indeed is a cool and thinker mastermind, it's hard to believe that he is as powerful as Braga said. He doesn't have that powerful and dominant charm/aura.So 7 out of 10 from me.",adhipar,2013-05-27,2013

Regardless of what the real franchise was meant to be this movie was OK. But only because there was some good action sequences most of which looked real to me not like the animated looking action we see these days! But guys, this is suppose to be a car racing type movie! Which suddenly dissipated since the 3rd movie! Well you can find so many flaws in this movie that i don't even need to mention!

224,7.0,"""Furious 6"" Review","Let's get it out of the way, ""Furious 6"" is an insanely stupid movie. The acting is horrendous, the writing is worse, and the plot is thinner than a playing card. However, despite all of these flaws, this film is immensely entertaining. It's fast, full of energy, and one liners that will have you rolling on the floor. It's a film that knows exactly what it is and what it wants to achieve. It isn't afraid to mix over the top action with sappy melodrama. The film has its own unique style and is filled with what young people today refer to as ""swag."" Justin Lin has done wonders with this franchise. The racing/car chase sequences are well shot and edited. The audience really feels apart of the experience. Along with the fast and adrenaline infused car sequences, this film has the best hand to hand combat so far this year. The fights are well choreographed, shot, and edited to a point were I almost feel every punch and kick being thrown. There are some ridiculous set pieces in this film, but they are exciting and entertaining as heck. I was literally at the edge of my seat even when my brain was telling me that what is happening is totally idiotic.I feel that I don't really have to talk about the actors or characters at this point. Mainly due to the fact that they've been around for so long and also because they're not the main reason for why we go see these films. I know they have a special place in our hearts now, but they aren't all too interesting or filled with enough depth to go into detail. However, I do love how we feel apart of their family.Overall, ""Furious 6"" is a very entertaining and fun film. The plot, writing, and characters may be dumb, but hey, this series is like family and no matter how stupid or dumb it can be, we love it no matter what. Especially when we have physics defying stunts, a great soundtrack, and The Rock. I give it 3.5/5, a popcorn flick that knows exactly what the audience wants.",TheConnoisseurReviews,2013-05-29,2013

Basically terrible script and terrible story. Acting is a joke. Let's see one example. Terrorists want to grab a computer chip from the military base but soldiers instead of protecting it in the base send it out somewhere. Very stupid idea generally since military base is a fortress. But OK, let's pretend that this is some kind of protocol. So what does this convoy have? One truck and two jeeps. Really??? Come one, the whole movie is like that. One big joke. Scenery looks good however, but that is not enough to give it more that 3 stars.",vardown,2013-07-09,2013
232,7.0,Worth a watch for Dom and Brian,"The movie is a fast paced action packed movie, as expected!Fast 5 ended with Letty being shown as alive, so obviously the curiosity was high regarding the suspense. The second thing to look forward to was the partnership between Dom and Hobbs.The suspense regarding Letty was nicely built up but probably ended up being weak in the end. Dom and Hobbs, together had a nice going with muscles and bashing all around. They find an able enemy in Klaus and Shaw.For me, the revelation of this movie was the chief villain Shaw, played by Luke Evans. He brings a certain arrogance, suave and menace, as expected from any villain who would be fighting against the likes of Dom. He does a good job. The movie has nice suspense in between and the end. It does go a little slow in between but that is a relief as it will gave u time to catch your breath amongst all the fast paced action with cars speeding and flying all around. The movie does not fail with the core of the movie, car racing! New cars, new stunts and new tactics. Some of the scenes, although, were blown out of proportion! Overall Justin Lin and Chris Morgan do good justice to the series.And yes! The movie does answer the question whether there'll be another one in the series. Go watch it for the answer, mine got ruined because of the social websites, go and watch it before someone spoils it for u (if it still hasn't happened already!)",ankitbahri,2013-05-31,2013

239,8.0,Good but not the best,"We're at the sixth movie of the high speed franchise. Dom and his gang are recruited to capture mercenaries who want to create a weapon that will destroy the world. I might as well tell you guys how I feel about the other movies. The first one is good, I know it's a Point Break rip off but it still feels different kinda like Home Alone 2. The second one is good or decent, not bad, I can write one or two paragraphs on this but I won't bother. The third one is decent for sure and it's the worst. It's a spin off, not exactly a sequel and it easily could have a straight to DVD movie. I allowed myself to see it three times and I won't watch it again. The fourth one is good and it's the first true sequel because Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are in it, not just one of them. The fifth one is the best, it's a heist movie and Dwayne Johnson's character Luke Hobbs is introduced. Back to Fast Six, it's bigger than the previous movie but not better. The plot is thin, it's bloated and Hobbs is no longer an antagonist. Before the premise was announced, I thought Hobbs would still be chasing Dom and his gang and maybe they would be forced to work together again. Hobbs is still interesting, he doesn't have any boring conversations with Dom but their previous relationship was better. Who knows, maybe they will become antagonists later on. The action is good and yeah it's ridiculous. Dom is like a superhero and the Iron Giant just popped into my head. There's no shaky cam bullshit and there a lack of CGI. The villain is insane mercenary Owen Shaw played by Luke Evans. He is cliché but still threatening. He doesn't say why he wants to destroy the world, maybe he feels some destruction will help improve the world later on. Unlike the last villain, he doesn't sit around doing paperwork, he drives around and hurts a few people. He smiles during the tank scene which shows he's sadistic. This movie is lighthearted, it's not gritty like Fast Four or the Dark Knight trilogy or the upcoming Need For Speed movie which I'm looking forward to. There are some jokes and most of them work. I didn't write this review earlier because I didn't feel like writing any reviews and I recently decided I should write some reviews because I enjoy writing. Fast Seven will be coming out on April 2015 and only time will tell if Brian will get killed off. James Wan is the director, Justin Lin dropped out because he naturally wants to do other movies. I read James wants the action to be more realistic and I like that idea. I also like Jason Statham who is playing the villain and I read he doesn't want to destroy the world. Okay I'm done yapping.",ty-jensen,2013-12-23,2013

If you want to watch a properly crap film then this is the film for you, and when the titles start rolling just run out of the cinema. The acting was pretty lame, and I am sick of seeing Dwayne Johnson in all of these sort of films. i haven't yet seen any of the previous Fast and Furious Films, but I do not plan on, judging by how bad this film was. i am quite glad that the next films in the series will have a new director, for humanities sake, I also think that a new cast, and crew, definitely a new writer, or even just cutting the films altogether would make a massive improvement!",edwardo-walsh,2013-05-24,2013

Through this film, viewers were exposed to what actually happened to Letty in the fourth film (Fast & Furious). The film begins with the introduction of the cast with gazette from the previous Fast franchise playing in the background. This is very creative as viewers get a glimpse of the previous story lines. The car chasing scene between DK and Han on the road of Tokyo and 'Jason Statham' appearance at the end of this film is not only surprising to the audience but also provides clear picture of what's happening and creating exciting new plot for this movie sequel which is also the sequel to The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift.",murgy86,2013-09-24,2013

Since the first time I saw 'The Fast and The Furious' 12 years ago, I knew I found my car/mayhem fix. Although I never thought it would last to see iteration #6, I was more eager this time around than for the first. No surprises, besides the unpredictable nature of Owen Shaw. The only real curveball was the substantiation of an Internet rumor that Jason Statham joined 'Fast 6'. Well, sorta -- end credits. After the audience ""ooooohh's"" at Statham's revealing, I couldn't wait, yet again, for the 7th! Fun factoid: This movie marked the reuniting of 2 'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' characters.

248,6.0,Finally feelings took over the muscles,"We all know up to now Fast & Furious has been one of the most successful movie franchises. I remember the time when I watched the first part of Fast & Furious. I really fell in love with this movie! I loved every single detail about it: story line, actors (that was when I knew about Vin Diesel and Paul Walker and got addicted to them), cars, but mostly car races. Then there was the second part of Fast & Furious that was not less interesting and exciting. I thought there wouldn't be any continuation, but deep inside hoped for that. And then, some years later, Universal Pictures announced the release of Fast & Furious 3, then 4, and 5. I was anxious to see those parts and loved them. But, frankly speaking, already starting with Fast & Furious 4 I was getting bored. There were less and less new things in the movie and it looked like this franchise started to be exhausted. With the release of the 5th part, honestly, I hoped it would be the end. But, as you know, this year we saw Fast & Furious 6.I admit, I expected too much from this part. I believed the director and producer would add some new things, new intrigues, but in reality everything was the same, just like in previous series. Here the story repeats again: in order to get freedom and clear his crew's criminal records Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) has to cooperate with the agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) to help him to take down a criminal organization led by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) and in which Dom's presumed-dead ex-girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is involved. Of course, there are fights with superman deeds (for example, when Dom saves Letty from falling out of the track), a bit of car races, shoot-outs, some humor scenes. Everything is just like in previous parts. But at the same time there are some attempts, unexpected though, to insert into the story line moral and human notions, such as love, feeling, freedom, betrayal, friendship. I can't say it worked. For me it looked a bit awkward. Imagine the scene where the fight is at its highest point and suddenly a jockstrap declares his love to the girl (the moment when Dom is talking to Letty when he finally meets her). And there are lots of such scenes. What I am trying to say is that for many people Fast & Furious is an action movie where people are not only used, but they require action, a lot of action. And now the director in order to prolong the existence of this franchise tries to turn it in some kind of soap opera by adding all this moral and emotional elements that don't match at all even with the characters. When you expect tough races and fights, but instead you get gentleness and tears – this is a bit confusing and disappointing and even boring.Well, my general opinion is that Fast & Furious has exhausted. It doesn't have anything new to suggest to its audience. Now, this movie is not about the cars and action, but about the morality. So, if you want to see a film full of fights and intrigues, you'd better chose something different. And I don't think the 7th part will be different, don't have any expectations from it. But we will see",eatakmakova,2013-12-30,2013
251,1.0,Most overrated film since the Avengers,"Are you f u c k i n g kidding me? I guess this got positive reviews because compared to the other installments in the franchise, this one is like a masterpiece. But still absolutely ridiculously stupid & can barely be called a film.Not sure what we are supposed to take less seriously: Paul Walker's acting, Vin Deisel's monotone delivery, or that this is the 6th one of these pieces of garbage. Is this all Hollywood has to offer us these days? Reboots, remakes, and sequels? May as well continue the theme of making board games into major motion pictures because this is just absolutely horrendous. Fast and Furious is slowly becoming the Police Academy of our time.

They tweaked the formula, and suddenly a franchise of over-glorified music videos became entertaining popcorn flicks. No, the plots aren't great, the dialog is cliché and the acting won't win any awards (unless you count The Razzies), but I can't recall having more fun watching a straight-up action movie in a long, long time. A lot of it doesn't make any sense if you think about it too hard, but then again it's a Summer action movie. You're not SUPPOSED to think too hard. My advice; Buckle-up and enjoy.

262,7.0,"Good fun, as far as you don't compare it to Fast Five","After having watched the trailer to the new addition in this exciting, edge of the seat action, it immediately went on my list of 'Must watch' titles. 2013 had a lot of interesting films coming out, but after the post credit scene of Fast Five, which according to me was the perfect action film that would appeal to almost everyone, with its great cast, heart pumping car races and solid plot, I obviously had big expectations for this one...But having said that, the first half of the film was a bit of a let down. I understand that they wanted to re-establish the characters, and try and emphasize on the concept of 'we don't turn our backs on family', but I'm not sure that's what audience usually expect in the Fast and Furious franchise. And the villain gang, despite it's potential, weren't established properly, and we didn't get much of a chance to create an opinion on them. With the slight disappointment of the first half, there came the second, which made up for all the lack of cars and speed up until that point. And it was completely worth it. Here, I can say that the trailer didn't show all the best parts, and there was way more to 'They got a tank' and the super cool scene with the car bursting out from the plane. As far as the cast goes, Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson were great playing their tough guy roles and they did fairly succeed in their attempt to match the Dom-Hobbs face off from the predecessor. Michelle Rodriguez reminded us what we felt was missing in the series after she was assumed dead. All in all, it was good fun, and does prove to be entertaining despite it's flaws; as far as you don't compare it to its predecessor. And watch out, for this one has a surprise ending as well, and you will not be disappointed (This time placed before the entire end credits, so you shouldn't miss it, like you probably did in Fast Five...not unlike me)",sanjna-polamarasetty,2013-06-09,2013
263,6.0,Same movie over and over again,"This is the sixth installment in the Fast and the Furious franchise, so fastened your seats and enjoy this 2 hour and 10 minute thrill ride that has real movie car chases at top speeds, real movie stunts and join Toretto and his gang as they go on a high stakes adventure through Picadilly Circus, Moscow, the Canary Islands, Tokyo and Hong Kong. There's British guy who wants to buy their old-fashioned garage car business while their in England and Russian villain who doesn't want them to have a happy ending. The cast includes Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Chris Ludarcis Bridges, Dwayne the Rock Johnson, Tyrese Gibson, Michelle Rodgrieuz, and Sung Kang. The film feels rushed but that's alright by me, it's supposed to feel rushed and fast. I really enjoyed this movie, you got supercops and supercriminals going way over their heads and keeping it cool and straight and out of the jailbox. The cinematography and camera-work is outstanding and the sound effects are vroom. This is even better than ""Fast Five"" and better than that movie ""Erased"" that I saw on On Demand. What I learned about this movie is that if you trash a old-fashioned car and you could always put it back together again or fix it with the powerful mechanics and tools we have today.",jpc8024-956-993529,2013-05-28,2013

270,5.0,"They started out defying traffic laws, now they defy gravity laws.","It is not good but nor is it bad. Fast and Furious 6 is a bit above average movies that was flawed. I found the story predicable and cliché. It was pretty much unoriginal from a person having amnesia to a person who betrays the groups. Also, too much was going on and after one thing got fixed more problems came in when it should of just ended at that point. It is also really stupid when the villain is right in front of your eyes who you are trying to capture and yet you let him go and wait another time for the real deal. The story is not as clean as the last one but is it far better than the earlier movies of this franchise. I also found the dialogue ridiculous and unnecessary and kept on face palming each time they add a line. As for the positives, obviously the action scenes were awesome especially the plane scene at the end. Also, make sure to stay after the credits, it will give you clues to what F&F7 is going to be and possible villain for 7. Overall, Fast and Furious 6 is a mediocre movie that is worth a one time watch. Nothing really special but if someone wants some action this is the movie to watch. Not the best so far this summer but neither is it the worst. Fast Five will remain the best of the series.",gee_lok,2013-05-18,2013
271,6.0,London Baby!,"Who would have thought back in 2001 that The Fast and the Furious would somehow because a movie series that would last to six movies with a seventh on the way? Even more surprising the Fast and Furious series has become of the premier action series and being one of Universal Studios' biggest cashcows.After the Rio heist all of Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew have gone their separate ways and now multi-millionaires. But despite longing for a quiet life they are brought back into action when Diplomatic Security Service Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) gets the crew to help him stop a former British SAS officer turned mercenary Owen Shaw (Luke Shaw) who has been target military convoys in Europe to make a tech bomb. Hobbs has a big incentive for Toretto to go back into action by having proof his girlfriend and long-time love Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) is still alive and working for Shaw. With the crew in London car chases and fighting eschews.The appeal of The Fast and Furious films since Justin Lin has taken over the direction of the series has been his championing of practical effects. Whilst there is some CGI (which isn't particularly good) Fast 6 is still a feat of stunt work, fight sequences and in camera effects. Lin does know how to direct an action sequences, giving us an excellent car chase in London, the tank chase in its full ridiculousness and the final sequence involving a military transport plane (even if it takes place on the world's longest runway). Gina Carano and Joe Taslim from Haywire and The Raid were both added to the cast, bringing their fighting talents to the series and they are fine additions. Taslim has an excellent fight with Tyrese Gibson and Sung Kang in Waterloo Station (though it wasn't really filmed in Waterloo Station). I was disappointed by the fight between Carano and Rodriguez but that is because of the fight was shown in the trailers and it was intercut to much with the Taslim fight.Fast and Furious 6 has a massive cast with some members getting more attention then others. The big winners were Diesel and Johnson; both are massive screen presence with charisma and have the action chops. Johnson steals the shows once again, being a mass of muscle with one-liners and plenty of action ability: it is impressive the casting director was able to find a man bigger then The Rock so the pair could fight. Walker is his usual bland self and Joanna Bowster gets the shaft again, this time holding the baby. Carano is a woman of action and little words and Gibson is the comic relief to the point he was a bit annoying.A problem with the series has been the villains have been lacklustre. Evans is a man who is servable in the role and he is the best villain so far simply because he does feel more of a threat because he is a man of action himself, getting involved in the frontline, being a driver and a skilled martial artist: it is better then a middle aged crime lord with a load of heavies. But Fast 7 will have a better a villain with the post credit scene setting up the sequel.Whilst the action seemed like a step up from the Fast Five, the story is so much sillier. The Fast and Furious series has never been know for being strong storytelling but at least with Fast Five it felt a believable that these characters would attempt a massive heist, but Fast and Furious 6 was much more of a stretch just to reunite the team and get them working with Hobbs who has quickly become a fans favourite. The crew has shown to be expert investigators suddenly. We have American characters going round the more seedy side of London; they would be very noticeable very quickly. And as a Brit I do take it personally when the film used outdated stereotypes of British people like the snotty salesman.Like Fast Five, Fast and Furious 6 is long and baggy, but this problem felt more prominent as the film tried to give anyone a moment to shine and there were sequences that could have been cut. One example is when O'Conner goes undercover in a prison in Los Angeles which was just a plot cul-de-sac and reference more to Fast and Furious (which was a forgettable entry). It needed a re-write to just tighten thinks up because the running time could have been under two hours. Fast and Furious 6 is surprising convoluted for what is supposed to be a simple action flick.Funs of the series with be very satisfied with the sixth entry and on an action level it is solid. It is good to see practical effects in an action film. But it mindless and silly and it unlikely to appeal to detectors. Still the seventh film should be interesting just because of the villain.",freemantle_uk,2013-05-31,2013

277,10.0,"Leave your brain at home and ENJOY THE RIDE, 'cause you will!","Im giving this one 9 out of 10! Why, you ask?The Fast and the furious franchise are well-known for their amazing action sequences. Not for their average script or kind-of-okay acting. THEY GIVE WHAT THEY PROMISE YOU!The Acting: It was okay! They really didn't need to express many emotions, besides Angry, happy, sad and... ready-to-race-ish. The actors did their job well enough. 7/10 for the actingThe story/script: The story didn't have many layers. There are some plot twists you might not expect. But you don't expect them because you probably don't care enough about the characters involved in the twists. 7/10 for the story. They did tie up the third and the fourth to this one, which I think was a pleasant surprise though.The scenery: They chose some amazing places to shot at! London, Spain, a little bit of their old house back in the USA. The movie was very well filmed! 9/10The action sequences: Wow! Amazing! The list of actors contained THE ROCK, Vin freaking diesel, but you won't find ""Mr. Gravity"" in there! They were great shot, amazing performed and the CGI was very well used. I could not have wished for better action scenes! 10/10 for sure!#tank #plane #therock #awesomeComedy: Their was some comedic relief and It actually didn't feel forced at all. It worked very well!In general: This movie delivers exactly what you're hoping for! I would pay to see it again on the big screen! 9/10 FOR SURE! Go see it as Fast as you can!P.s.: Wait till the post credit scene! It will satisfy the fans and excite the audience in general!",gangstah_vino,2013-05-25,2013
278,2.0,The plot gets thick,"By the time you see Han and his girl say that line about next is tokyo, you know it's going to roll back to the beginning of Tokyo drift, and because Han was alone in the movie, so obviously the girl friend die in this tragecly poor plot sequel of F&F.And then you realize Han's death was not of accident but murdered by mr. transporter here from out of nowhere... THIS IS HILOURISLY STUPID! I don't think I would care more about this franchise ... what an insult. Letty's pathetic survival was by all mean has no logic in it. This is cheesier than any soap opera I've seen all my life.Thank you so much to bring a period to this awesome series to trash and please put more trash cans into the next one if your intention is to praise trash anyway! still 1 star given to awesome action sequence",mixacase,2013-09-02,2013

283,10.0,This is how fun movies should be,"The Fast and Furious movies are never going to be Oscar darlings but when you pay your money at the movie theater to see them you know what you're going to get and they deliver it for you. Not only are the F&F movies fun and great popcorn entertainment they don't insult your intelligence like the Transformers or Battleship type blockbusters do.Vin Diesel and Paul Walker have great chemistry together as the leads for the series. Great to see one of the original 4 characters of Michelle Rodriguez back in the fold. Her lack of presence was missing in Fast Five. Don't get me wrong Fast Five was a great movie even without her but the Brian, Dom, Mia and Letty characters make it feel like a true F&F movie. Without one of the 4 main characters it takes away from the F&F feel of the movie. That's probably why Tokyo Drift was the weakest of all the F&F movies.",Maniac-9,2013-05-28,2013
284,10.0,They get better as they come! On to number 7!,"I am a massive fan on the fast and furious films. I love them all. The first, second, third, fourth and fifth! But this sixth film... This was definitely something else. I went to the cinema to see this. It wasn't sold out but the screen was packed with people! The film was bone chilling from the very start. Literally just sat on the edge of your seat. Nail biting.. Always wondering what type of brilliant action would you get next!Once the film had finished. I was completely blown away it was that amazing! So much better than the fifth one! Even though we looked like idiots because we were the only ones who did it, me and my dad stood up after and clapped! I'd say we were both happy to spend our money to see this!Everyone who is in this film pulls off their role as a character so brilliantly! Vin diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodrigez and all of the others! If I had a cold beer in my hand I would raise my glass to the cast of this unbelievably brilliant film!I really do recommend this to anyone who is a big fan of the fast and furious series.. Take it from a guy with experience who has been there and done that. You will be blown away by it all. The cars, the action, the storyline and even the tank.Lets all raise our glasses to Fast and Furious 7 which is released sometime next year in 2014! Can't wait for it. Absolutely buzzing!!",ferrarirocks,2013-05-30,2013
285,8.0,Love these movies,"Fast and Furious won't let you down. Even it is a 6th installment on this series it still rocks. Movie is turbo loaded popcorn entertainmet loaded with testosteroine and smell of gas. The story isn't the brightest, but that can easilly forgive because this movie is exactly what you are waiting for. Movie is full of great action scenes which are so exaggeration that you can only laugh for them. Thankfully movie doesn't take itself too seriously, you understand that at the latest when Dwayne Johnson is to be called as a sumerian Thor. With the previous movie I was hoping that next movie get it's bad guy from Jason Statham. It didn't became truth in this movie, but the end scene promises that Jason Statham will be the bad guy in next installment. Can't wait to see that. Leave your brains to cloakroom and enjoy great entertainment.",tinovalkki,2013-07-04,2013
286,5.0,A lost opportunity.,"The movie was big. It had a large scale. It had good actors and a big budget. But poor direction and bad story left it as a more than disappointing experience. The director seems to not have even the basic grasp of elementary physics. My woes arise from the many lost opportunities. There are many movies out there which have a shitty storyline, but great action to make up for it (Die Hard 5 comes to mind). But this couldn't even achieve that. The action choreography seemed to have been done by a child playing with action figures. The movie is plagued with bad dialogues and stupid attempts at comedy. Frankly, the only thing positive about the movie is the cast. Overall, it is not worth your money.",Krennex,2013-05-25,2013
287,10.0,A Scoop of Awesome with sprinkles of greatness! A topping of delicious action packed goodness!,"I was surprised by the low reviews and so much trash talk about the film. I am so HAPPY that the entire cast from Fast 5 is in the movie. Film makers and Directors don't understand how important it is for the characters to remain the same, yet grow on screen. I am LOVING how the introduced the plot- which is another Job. Not to mention sexy sexy sexy cast! I'm only 16 minutes in, but I am LOVING, LOVING, LOVING IT!! The adversary in this movie is sure to leave you hanging on the edge of your seats, while I am getting some hint of the first Batman remake with Heath Ledger, by some of the cars and stunts. This ""bad guy"" in the movie is giving the Guys of Fast & the Furious a run for their money!",jsphillips831,2013-06-18,2013

291,8.0,A guilty pleasure.,"Everyone has something they enjoy that they really shouldn't. Lance had drugs, Tiger had women who weren't his wife and I have the F&F franchise. Thankfully my guilty pleasure won't get me into trouble, just weird looks from those who know I have zero interest in cars in real life. But that's the joy of this series: it's a souped-up fantasy with no interest in being grounded. With physics, common sense and realism all gleefully thrown out of the window, returning director Justin Lin concocts an awesome array of ludicrous vehicular set-pieces and bone- crunching fights, accompanied with tongue-in-cheek humour and amusing references to past Fast flicks. The cast know they are on a good wicket with this seemingly invincible franchise and are clearly having a blast. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker lap up the opportunity to play their most popular roles once again, Michelle Rodriguez is back in the part that made her big, Gina Carano and Luke Evans get in on the fun, whilst Dwayne ""Samoan Thor"" Johnson again commands your undivided attention as law enforcer Hobbs. If these movies aren't your thing then this sixth instalment won't change that, but if you're already a fan then you'll be in a supercharged, nitrous-oxide-injected heaven.",Troy_Campbell,2013-06-06,2013
292,10.0,My favorite movie franchise,"The F-N-F crew has struck GOLD again yet again. Man, as long as you guys keeping making these movies, I will be paying to see them, and waiting on the Blue-Ray to drop. And a lot of sequels, they don't get better, they don't get it right on the second, to even get a chance for a third, but yours do. And adding more fire power as your franchise grows is an awesome touch for then fan base! The Rock was an awesome addition. Vin and Paul, keep up the great work.... And Paul, I'm a Nissan guy too, so seeing the GTRs and those 240sx pop up time after time is all the better. Vin you need to switch from the Mopor man, LOL. F-N-F, you have a true fan for life.

293,10.0,Loved it!,"As great as the original Fast & Furious! High adrenaline and fast cars. Who would have guessed they would have put so much time into the storyline along with the time they put in these actor's appearances. It is a great movie for those adults & young adults who have grown up with these movies. Due to the fighting and drug cartel references not a great movie for kids. This is a movie you would want to leave the kiddos home with a babysitter as you enjoy it. Upbeat, high energy, and will leave you smiling! This is a great movie to watch with the full impact of the movie theater experience. An absolute must see! Never a dull moment!",Groovercare,2013-06-09,2013
294,1.0,Movie was terrible. Don't waste your money.,"Horrible movie. The action sequences were weak and unbelievably bad. The acting was some of the worst I have ever seen and don't even get me started on the generic repetitive storyline. Even for an action movie, this was incredibly boring. They have been milking this series so long that it's barely lactating. Please, do yourself a favor and don't watch this piece of trash movie. Only good part was after the credits.The dialogue suffers from generic lines spat out from other movies and the plot armor on the characters is so obvious that there's no tension because you already know which can and can't die. The series is so afraid of losing one of the main characters that they make all the effort to revive them just to please the crowd that is obsessed with that specific character. So many of the scenes are just unbelievably bad and ignore every single law of physics. While watching the movie, I was hoping time would speed up because there was literally nothing to look forward to in this movie. The plot didn't get better throughout the movie and felt very stale. Slow progression and overall too long.",Zetram,2013-06-08,2013

The cars are sexy and the Toretto family is still kicking in gear in a another action pack adrenaline rush manhunt.You think the movie will start off slow but, oh no it cuts right to the chase to not leave the viewer bored. Not only its filled with action ,but good humor as well. Especially, Roman who kept the audience filled with laughter mostly every scene he is in. I loved how The Rock simply kicks so much ass even when he is standing still giving orders. Very glad to see he is in the pack again. A great character to the franchise. Vin Diesel is still the same old Vin we all knew from the previous Fast and The Furious movies ,but pairs up with The Rock which makes it even better.Very good movie you wouldn't want to miss in theaters.

I believe they did a good job at explain the back story for first time watchers. Will defiantly be watching the other 5! For me there was a little to much unrealistic parts but I believe that is what happens with any high budget action movie. Like I said this was my first Fast and Furious movie so I am not sure if every actor has been in every movie but I believe you can truly tell that they have an almost family like bond between the cast and even the crew. I believe that, the fact that they have this relationship with each other truly adds to the movie.

You want story go watch pearl seven borne. You don't go for story when you watch Stepup franchise all you care is freaking dance.. so to the people who did't like this movie you did't see what actually the director wanted you to look.If the movie had story primary then people would be bitching about ""there weren't enough cars in there franchise forgot what this series is all about"".get over it.

This movie grabs and holds your attention as you go for ""fast and furious"" ride with the now familiar group of guys and gals who are tough on the outside and strong and good on the inside. This is Michelle Rodriguez's best movie to date. She is a wonderful actress and delivers another great performance, and dominates her scenes. The rest of the cast is excellent too. Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson once again team up to create a lot of excitement. The story itself is great. It contains almost nonstop action interspersed with clever lines. The good guys are good and the bad guys are bad. Luke Evans delivers a strong performance as the lead bad guy, Shaw. Although the story is far-fetched and stretches the boundaries of plausibility, still it works, and as a result is entertaining, and for that reason alone this movie is worth watching.",PWNYCNY,2013-05-28,2013

330,8.0,Bizarro World,"Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is officially the new Arnold Schwarzenegger. But more importantly, the person in charge of keeping The Rock bicep-deep in arm butter should get some Executive Producer credits and be deemed the new hardest working man in Hollywood.Under the direction of Justin Lin, ""Fast & Furious 6"" sees the return of almost everyone from ""Fast Five""; including Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner, Dwayne Johnson as Hobbs, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, etc. as they come together for one last job...again. Also joining the crew is Gina Carano as Hobbs' assistant (and my future wife) who is apparently given free rein to go MMA on everyone she sees fit. And returning (because she's got nothing better to do) is Michelle Rodriguez, in a storyline less focused on, the better.Synopsis: Duhhhhhh.Fast cars go fast.Why the movie works: This is clearly Lin's best visual stab at the franchise yet, as he not only creates the best things-blow-up climax to come out of any of these films, but also (for the second time in a row) gives his audiences exactly what they came to see. Lin does a brilliant job of making sure there is either a car driving fast, a woman in a bikini, or the Rock giving someone the people's eyebrow and spouting off something fantastically WWE-ish, on the screen at all times. In fact, he has done so well with guiding this franchise into the realm of highly entertaining B movie fluff, that it is a wonder why he is being replaced by horror director James Wan for the upcoming ""Fast & Furious 7"".Side Note: I realize Lin did direct both ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" and ""Fast & Furious"" as well, but let's be honest, those movies are better left forgotten.Final Thought: Aside from the fact that ""Fast & Furious 6"" is a tad too long, that Vin Diesel still calls what he does acting, that there is an odd body distortion phenomenon which happens when Diesel and The Rock stand next to each other and that the storyline doesn't really matter (especially the more sentimental sections) I'm not ashamed to say that I was thoroughly entertained as I walked out of the theater. And while I realize that this is a lot to look past, if you are the type to spend your hard earned money on a movie entitled ""Fast & Furious 6""; a movie which is filled with unbelievable, yet well constructed, high flying, auto-centric stunts and enough comic relief to get the casual fan through, then this installment is clearly worth watching.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

336,9.0,This moment. We Own It.,"At first when I heard the song ""We Own It(Wiz Khalifa ft. 2 Chainz)"" playing at the starting credits of the movie which is a collage of first 5 films, I said to myself, ""I have got my money's worth"". Fast and Furious 6 brings out an ensemble cast along with amazing action.In this movie, Hobbs(Dwayne Johnson) seeks the help of Torreto(Diesel) to catch a criminal named Shaw(Evans) by offering him to reunite him with Letty(Rodriguez) who was presumed dead. Then on its the story how Torreto assesmbles the team and takes on Shaw, along with trying his best efforts to get back Letty. The story doesn't have much to it, but its the action sequences with some nest jaw dropping moments in recent times along with one-liners, keeps you entertained. There are few over the top sequences, but Fast and Furious fans are not gonna mind that.Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, essay their roles with ease. In this part we see a lot of action from Dwayne Johnson and trust me its good. Gina Carano's fights are cool. But its Tyrese Gibson with his funny and loud-mouthed Roman Pearce who wins your hearts and a special mention to Ludicrous who has some witty dialogues.Director Justin Lin shows how genius he is at the end when he connects some missing links. Overalll Fast and Furious 6 is another super 'add-on' to one of the enthralling movie franchisees. Go and sit in the Driver's seat!",sujanfaster,2013-05-29,2013

338,9.0,One of My favorite Movie,"Will I like this kind of Movie....The Voice and Style of Van Diesel, the Power of Champ(Rock) Outstanding Movie... The F&F 6 I also liked Because the uniqueness in Style like in 6 Series they stole the whole bunch of Money Bank....And the way they carry is WOW... There's love between man and his machine (aka: shiny paint jobs on cars most of us can only afford to download images of); the love of the adrenaline (aka: there goes the neighbourhood, and the city's reconstruction budget); the love of a man with his fellow man.There's also love for the family and the urge to keep it together but most importantly to the antagonist of the movie – the love of money. These last two factors play a big role in Fast 6 (also known as Furious 6). The former of the reasons include the misleadingly deceased Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodrigues), Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel's) former girl- friend, turned amnesiac female muscle of the villains.Letty's actual necessity – as the necessity of any of the parts of the Fast franchise – is questionable. Perhaps it is just as much as the plot device about the villains needing a chip to make a 'Nightshade' contraption capable of blacking out the power of an entire region (seriously? Well we experience the use of same device daily, I guess).This matters not, because for whatever its worth, the Fast movies are beyond unexciting. Mr. Diesel and co. is the reason behind the sale of the tickets; later DVD's; much later the commercials on television. His recent workmates include Dwayne Johnson as Luke Hobbs and Gina Carano as Riley Hicks – aka the anti Letty. Seeing Ms. Carano and Ms. Rodrigues duke it out is one of the giddy delights of Fast 6 (they duke it out twice, so the ticket automatically pays for itself twice at one go). However, there's still more.In keeping with the style here's what you get:Hobbs and Dominic – with their bulging biceps – muscle out frames, trying out plans to knock out the bad guy mercenary (Luke Evans); Brian (Paul Walker), now relegated to a notch-above-extra status, travels back to the US to learn how Letty survived; Roman and Tej (Tyrese Gibson and Chris 'Ludacris' Badges) play with machines; Han and Giesel (Sung Kang, Gal Gadot) provide ancillary window dressing. And of course, let's not forget the usual': mean hot-rods, skimpily clad women and two road- crushing, people-crunching finales – one involving a tank, the other a runaway airplane on a hundred mile runway.Fast 5's climax involved a giant bank vault being through the city, so in keeping with reality is not really a priority here. But by now, you already know that.Starring: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Sung Kang, Gal Gadot, Luke Evans, Gina Carano, and Elsa Pataky.Fancylive.com",ooppssee,2013-06-13,2013

341,1.0,tired addition to the franchise,"I was actually looking forward to this, right up until the point i actually watched it. I always believed that the object of a film should be to immerse the audience and suspend disbelief, and while the former was possible the latter never happened. Let's leave aside the obvious issue with any law enforcement agency of any type based within the countries known as the ""5 eyes"" requiring a group of retired criminals to work on their behalf. It would never happen. Lets also ignore the obvious problem within the plot regarding surveillance cameras in London, the most ""watched"" city in the world being conveniently ""down for maintenance"". As there are multiple agencies controlling multiple cameras in that country there is no chance that all those agencies would be offline at the same time. ""Brian"" managing to spend less than 24 hours in a California maximum security prison, ""as a favour"", after flying there and back seemingly in a couple of days and securing all the information he needed. Anyone who is even remotely aware of the American justice system would find that laughable. The plane chase along a runway that must have been at least 20 miles long for the amount of time it took the C5 Galaxy/ Illyshin IL76 (take your pick of heavy lift aircraft) to not quite take off, making it the longest non existent runway in the world. Street racing in central London lets ignore the fact that this scene had no reason to be in the film at all for a moment, except as justification for the title. It's Impossible! Flat out impossible with traffic calming measures, and some of the most crowded and narrow streets in the world, not to mention enormous police presence. Let's not even discuss the tank! So a film with a very lose series of sequences, based basically in London, i guess because the film grants went that way, because there is no reason any international criminal on every law enforcement radar in the western world would base himself in that city, dialogue that was so poor and so clichéd that it is worth watching only with the sound turned off, and a plot that has absolutely zero possibility of ever being believable and you have this film in a nutshell. Let's hope they give the next part of the franchise to some adults for script writing, because while the 13 year old's had a ball bringing this one to the screen, it can surely only appeal to those with a similar mindset.

342,9.0,Best Fast and Furious to date!!!!,"Freaking AAAAA!!!!! Wow, best Fast and the Furious to date!!!! Everything you need is right here. Drama, love, suspense, action, comedy, non stop thriller. This movie has more twist and turns then most movies in the last 5-years. And that's saying a lot!! It combines the previous Fast and the Furious together.......with the added twist at the very end. Boy, if you guys have doubts about this movie, say no more. This is a must see. Worth the money? Hell yeah and more.All the cast and crew comes back so you won't be disappointed. It leaves off from the last one. The story all flow together extremely well. Familiar faces, familiar foes. I mean, it's huge. The ads and trailers don't this movie justice. You just have to see it to believe it. Past, present, and future. Watch out. Fast and Furious 7 to be continued.",tomlu1,2013-07-07,2013
343,10.0,Awesome!,"Watched it 4 times already! Fast and furious 6 is equal with fast and furious one (fast 1 would only win because when it came out it was new and cool). The fast and furious franchise has, since number 4, improved dramatically in terms of screenplay, quality of acting, storyline and action sequences!The coming together of the team again together with ""The Rock"" Dwayne Johnson, really brings the chemistry of the team to another level. Watching Brian and Dom work together to run the team works so well, and each team member really brings in a special element that they can add to the team.The return of Letty to the franchise also helps to complete this and is good to see her character return to the story!Fast Cars, Amazing Soundtracks, Awesome Stunts and action sequences, overflowing testosterone and classic one liners really make fast and furious 6 the great movie that it is! 10 out of 10!Make sure you wait until the end of the credits!There's a reason why this movie was number one in the world for two weeks!",mooks88,2013-06-27,2013
344,9.0,Arguably the best movie in the franchise,"The sixth and latest installment in the Fast and the Furious franchise sees Agent Hobbs ask for the help of Dominic Toretto and his gang help track down a wanted criminal.I have to say that this was the movie I was most looking forward to in the 2013 Summer blockbuster period, and I'm glad to say that I got what I wanted from it.The movie had a lot of exciting action sequences which made it an improvement to the previous movie. Given that a lot of action movies lately have been disappointing mainly because of the lack of action, this is continuing the resurrection of proper action movies following The Expendables movies and The Last Stand. Let's hope this path remains open. Being a UK citizen, I loved the idea of having it set in London and having some of the action scenes take place in London, even though they were actually filmed in Glasgow. It made good use of the London scenery and it was nice to see the fabulous Rita Ora make a cameo. It also had a lot of humour which made it funnier than most bad comedy movies and even some popular ones which in my opinion were overrated (*cough* The Hangover *cough* Ted *cough*). The story-line wasn't exactly good but then again, none of the story- lines in any of the movies in this series are. At the end of the day, it's more style than substance. If I have one criticism to make, it's that one or two of the stunts were unrealistic. But let me put it this way - at least it's not as bad as a lot of really terrible and over-the-top Bollywood movies.I seriously think that this is the movie that should've rounded off the franchise rather than make a seventh movie for next year. All I can hope for now is that without Justin Lin on board, they don't mess it up.",amalank,2013-05-19,2013
346,8.0,Ride or die... Remember?,"This is not just a sequel, but it's a back to back sequel that goes back to all the five previous films. As we all know, Furious 6 stars the same cast from Fast Five (except Don Omar & Tego Calderon) and adds up new characters in the franchise who are Shaw (Luke Evans), Jah (Joe Taslim), Riley (Gina Carano) and brings back Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who was last seen in Fast & Furious (2009).This is definitely fast and furious if you compare this one to the other films. This is not about street racing. This is not about running away. And this is definitely not about another heist. Chris Morgan has sat down and written a predictable and strong script that drags ''The Fast And The Furious'' franchise more audience. But what we all should not forget is that this film is like a meal that has all types of delicious tastes. It has speed cars, amazing action sequences, sexy ladies, jokes that'll make you laugh for a while and at the end a surprise. Simply said, it's the action packed blockbuster of the year! It's actually pretty cool to see Dominic (Vin Diesel), Brian (Paul Walker) and the rest of the crew take side with Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson). When you leave the theater, it will give you a different, but satisfied feeling. Probably because all the actors in this film have important roles that just turn out to be bigger and bigger for each and every sequel. It's not just about Dom and Brian, but about everyone. Without one of all these characters, Furious 6 would have been a mess. That says how important each and every character is.Furious 6 is not a fun ride like Fast Five, but it is a serious ride. This is not the film you want to miss at the theater. Book the tickets as soon as possible, buy a pop-corn and soda and enjoy this ride. This is way better than what you think/expect.Dear Justin Lin, Thank you for the 4 fantastic films that you've directed in The Fast And The Furious saga. You will definitely be missed in the next film.",dkemathas,2013-05-24,2013
347,9.0,More Furious than ever!,"I don't think there has ever been a franchise in which the sixth entry has been it's best. I also don't think there has ever been a franchise where it really started getting good with the fourth. But here it is Furious 6 is one of the most entertaining action films I've ever seen. I won't lie and say that the series isn't a pure unadulterated guilty pleasure but make no mistake there is quality here. Director Justin Lin seems to be a master of orchestrating grand action set pieces, family melodrama thats actually engaging and a group of actors that let's face it are coasting on pure charisma and presence in these films at least. It's also surprising to see a franchise whose numbers have grown critically with each installment reaching an all time high with almost 80% positive on rotten tomatoes. And it's completely deserving. Picking up where the super entertaining Fast Five left off we find out automotive heroes enjoying their riches when Hobbs played by the king of likable himself the Rock tracks down Toretto (Diesel) for help with a very attractive international terrorist played by sexy Luke Evans the twist that was displayed in the last film is played as he tells him that the supposedly dead Letty played by Micelle Rodriguez with fierce sneer is alive and kicking. He of course immediately gathers up the gang and they go after her. What unfolds is a bit ridiculous which should be expected but it's also explosive. From the film's twists to the utter charm oozing off these actors to the one of a kind testosterone fueled adrenaline pumping action sequences this is one hell of a ride. There's even a few big surprises especially towards the end. With this entry they prove the formula isn't a fluke and I look forward to loads of more vehicular carnage for years to come. Gone are odd character moments and insipid car themed dialogue and what's replaced them is something you shouldn't feel guilty about loving cause it's awesome! 4.5/5",rivertam26,2013-05-27,2013

350,8.0,Firing on all cylinders!,"I haven't always had a love affair with the F&F series. I thought the first one was pretty dumb, hated the second, and never saw the third. The fourth drew me in - I rented it at some point and found it really entertaining. Then, they brought in The Rock for the fifth, and I knew I had to see it. Justin Lin made a near perfect action movie with Fast Five, including one of the best action movie sequences (as unbelievable as it may be) of all time with the safe steal. That heightened my expectations for Fast & Furious 6.Let's get this out of the way first - this movie has a terrible, terrible script. The dialogue is beyond horrible, to the point of eye rolling, and there are plot holes galore. However, you don't go into a F&F movie expecting to see a great script or natural dialogue - you go in to see over the top action set pieces, fast cars, and butt kicking...and on those notes, it hits on all cylinders.There isn't anything in this movie that tops the stolen safe from Fast Five, but a scene featuring a tank on a freeway comes pretty damn close. The finale is also really intense, but I wish it would have been shot during the day instead of night, because a lot of what's going on is hard to see. I understand it was probably done for editing purposes, but a lot of it was just so confusing during the end. We get to see a lot of classic cars, testosterone, and explosions - overall, it's just a really fun movie, as ridiculous as it may be at points.Don't get out of your seat right after the movie ends. There's a scene at the end that is surprising and amazing.",Jay-Klee,2013-05-27,2013

Lin and veteran screenwriter Chris Morgan have labored to add depth, dimensionality and inner conflict...""""Remember the second you go through those doors,"" says Vin Diesel's Dom Toretto. ""Everything changes."" Now that's wishful thinking. The Fast And The Furious films have never strayed too far from the formula, just doing enough tinkering under the hood to keep the franchise purring.This time the gang decamp to London after Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) – the dogged DSS agent who pursued them through Rio last time out – comes asking for help.Wisely, he wants to use the street-smarts of Dom, Brian (Paul Walker) and the rest for a their crew for a particularly dangerous mission. The target? A gang of pro hijackers led by ex-Special Ops soldier Owen Shaw (Luke Evans, excellent). The reward? Full pardons for Dom and his crew. The bait? That Dom's ex Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) – thought dead after a car accident in the fourth film – is alive and working with Shaw.",darkknightrises45,2013-05-23,2013
363,10.0,Start Your Engines!,"I watched ""Fast & Furious 6"" earlier yesterday, and I must say that this movie is amazing! I didn't think Lin could top 2011s FAST FIVE but this sixth installment is bigger & better! With extensive, explosive & entertaining action sequences, big laughs & lots of drama - Furious 6 delivers everything you'd expect + more! the pacing is perfect, it's great to see the team working together again, and the story is very intriguing - if you're a fan of the previous movies than this one will mean even more to you.Letty's presence is carefully scripted, and Shaw's ties to a former foe lead the team down some dark paths.. but thankfully they have Hobbs to help clear the way to take down this very dangerous gang.Everything comes full circle, and while it is fulfilling - it's also very dramatic how everything ends. You can never really go home again, it's always a different experience.Lin does a great job of balancing the characters, action pieces & story. Some really unexpected twists throughout - you won't see 'em coming!Make sure you watch(ed) 2009s FAST & FURIOUS & FAST FIVE before this- otherwise you'll be quite confused.

365,1.0,De gustibus...,"To start with: I'm a film amateur and I appreciate those old fashioned films that nearly no one bears. Given this preamble I have to say I'm really astonished by the votes here on IMDb. I give this film the worst possible vote not since it deserves it but just to push a balanced judgement as it's now on cinema and the actual average is 6,5 (I'd give it a 4-5). The film is a standard B-movie with the standard ingredients of the series. Races, pursuits, and everything authors could think when dealing with cars. Add some nice guys, some nice girls, a bad guy and expect authors to force their minds to find something more engaging than the 5th film finale (I admit it: 5th film final 10 minutes scene was really good from an action film perspective). Everything is predictable. Irony tries to be there but fails. Characters seem to follow a 200y old theater script. This seems to be just the summary of what producers think about the audience of their series: vroom, boom, bang, boobs, lol. Not good at all. I could give it a 6 only if I'd be with no money and I'd need to justify myself after spending my last 10 dollars on this flick. Fortunately I'm not so desperate.",Ladiloque,2013-05-31,2013

380,9.0,This series just keeps getting better,"This is one of those rare occasions when a franchise goes from being okay to being absolutely awesome. 12 years ago, I would have never expected this series to make it this far and not only that, to evolve into what it is today. Furious 6 does not pretend to be anything else but a high octane summer action movie and it does it better than any other movie this year so far.In Furious 6 agent Hobbs request the help of Dominic and his crew to find a dangerous mercenary in exchange for full pardon, but also to find Dominic's believed deceased girlfriend, Letty. This movie almost feels like a testosterone 007 movie. The series takes us to Spain and England. The chase sequences are just amazing, the stuns are great, and the cars, well; it's a Fast and Furious film. The acting it's what it is, but the thematic of family and friendship are believable and heartwarming. The main villain this time around is pretty solid and does feel like a true challenge for the protagonists. This movie was so well made and so fun to watch that after watching the surprise revelation at the ending credits I can't wait to see the next one. Furious 6 has it all, action, comedy, women, and a lot of insane cars. This is what true blockbuster movies are all about. I highly recommended.",nvillesanti,2013-05-27,2013
381,1.0,Seriously,"Why is this movie rated higher than Paul Thomas Andersen's The Master or Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. It isn't shocking to see a mindless movie like this gross a lot of money at the box office, since it is 12 year old's that frequent cinemas, but i can't understand why this movie has a 7.4 rating on IMDb where 12 year old's don't own accounts.I liked fast 5 because, so i went to the theater with my friends with bigger expectations and came out highly disappointed. the movie is full of plot holes to begin with. I usually forgive summer movies for this sin but it way to much here. It wasn't as half as funny as the first one. Some of the lines between Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous, who isn't a good actor by the way, aren't amusing. What is worse is that some times other conversations are introduced just so as to bring in a line between these two. It must be the epitome of bad script writing. My 13 year old sister could write better lines. The action sequences are also ludicrous. I know this is a fast and furious movie but the guys here do some stuff here that Spider-Man only dreams of. What is even more insulting is that the critiques aren't all that hard on this movie. I don't know why some summer movies are admonished for minor misdemeanors but this one gets a pass. One critique wrote that the fast and furious movies are getting so good that by the time they get to fast 16 it would be up for best picture. Do you value time and money? Do you have an IQ above 70?

386,8.0,Enjoyable and spectacular instalment! 8.,"I must say this is a saga I like. I liked the first installment, hated the two and third movies (awful) and was positively surprised by the next three, in fact, these are the best, specially the sixth. It is not an epic saga, like ""Star wars"", ""Indiana Jones"", ""Mission: impossible"" and ""007"", but it is very enjoyable and worth watching for the action fans like me. Justin Lin managed to revitalize the saga with the fourth part of it after those two piece of rubbish. In fact, the six one fixed in some way the third one (I should say it gives some sense to the third movie at the end). He really knows how to deal with action. It is true the action scenes are inverosimile, but they agree with the movie's tone. The car chases, gunshots and body fights are spectacular and one of the main attraction in the movie. The pace is another strong point. It never made me bored in spite of its more-than-two-hour-duration and poor performances. It begins by introducing the characters and their situation and then, the action begins with many explosions, chases, shots, twists, etc. The sceneography is very nice, the best in the saga: the Canary Islands, London and L.A. The soundtrack is very good and proper, too (listen to the song ""We own it""). The cast is attractive: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, The Rock, Elsa Pataky, Ludicrous, Gina Carano, Luke Evans, Jason Statham... Except the last two, these are not very good as actors, but are very appropriate for this kind of movies and deliver fun (not deep and dramatic) performance. This is not about character development at all, however it is true there is an evolution in the main character's lifes, which is good indeed. Vin Diesel is one of the least expressive actors in Hollywood's history (The Rock acts better even though he is not a real actor but a wrestling factor, unlike Vin). Paul Walker is dull and they should dress him better to take advantage of his beauty. Fortunately, Elsa's character is unimportant and the script contains many jokes. Anyway, in this aspect, this is the best movie in the saga because the cast contains both Jason Statham and Luke Evans. They are evil characters. The first only appears for a few seconds but very intensely. Luke Evans as the main villain plays a very believable and tough role which represents an added value for the movie. In conclusion, the worst in the movie are its lack of originality, rather flat characters and dull performances from many actors. The best thing is that it gives sense to the threequel, the pace, the capacity of entertaining, the cast, the action scenes (specially the first car chase in London), the sceneography (London is the city I visited I like the most), the main villain, Statham's cameo and the cars.

390,8.0,Fast 6,"I'll admit I was always a fan of the Fast and Furious series, but I wasn't a true lover of the series until it was revamped in 2009 with Fast & Furious; from there the series took off and became bigger and better.With that, Fast Six was a great flick don't get me wrong, the action, the story, and the cars were great, but I feel the movie was slightly too long and dragged out. I feel if they stuck to the pace of Fast Five, the film would have been perfectThe Pros: The cars were great! The actors sexy and believable and the action bigger and better than the predecessors.The sets amazing! had this been a straight racing movie, I feel the film would have fallen flat and not been as great.The Cons: The story had potential, it made sense and was definitely obtainable, having said that the story had too much going on that made the film jump around and wasn't cohesive. The action while amazing, was insane and probably would never happen in a real life setting (still was amazing to watch).Regardless of the cons that didn't float my boat, I still loved the movie and it was a pleasure to watch, i'm super stoked for Fast 7, if you want a taste of Fast 7 go watch Fast 6, enjoy a great car action movie and have a good time.",nflores342,2013-06-01,2013

393,8.0,A blast!,"This movie was a blast! It was an action packed, humor thrilled action film with cool stunts and fights. The way the characters are laid out and used in the film is how Joss Whedon would use his character in a TV series he would make. My Example being Firefly. This is a prequel to a few of the previous films, though I will admit I lost track of the order. However plot and characters and all of those tie ins with the other movies wasn't too much of a concern since I went into this movie to watch an action packed thrill ride that would take some time out of my night, and then help me sleep and dream about fast cars and beautiful women. It's not as good as Fast Five 5, but its just as entertaining.",jayore3,2013-05-25,2013
394,8.0,Action Packed,"Lots of action here from start to finish. The story plot I thought was better in fast 5 but Fast 6 doesn't disappoint with it's ambitious action scenes. Undoubtedly the scene that got the biggest pop from the crowd was the second ending. The ending after the credits but thats saying a lot considering we saw a full slobber-knocker scene with Michelle Rodriguez and the MMA chick, a ambitious air plane scene, and insane highway-bridge sequence. Oh yeah...we still got to see some cars and some hot girls with daisy dukes on.THis franchise definitely got better as time went on...a welcome change since usually most movie franchises go down the drain.",jfm358-88-873130,2013-06-08,2013

I would make one change and that is to return to its roots, Drag racing and a bit less circuit racing. Don't get me wrong I love the movie but Drag racing is just so much more exciting. I was really pleased with the return of Michelle Rodríguez, I love her character. The car selection is great from the Nissan Skyline to the '74 Ford Escort RS2000. The casting is great all my favourite actors and actresses are back and looking good. The fight scenes where very well choreographed and very entertaining.

402,8.0,My First F&F Film and I Liked It!,"I have not seen a single installment of the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, one of only a few, I am sure. I never got around to watching the first one at all, consequently I never did get to watch the second, nor any of the five. There was very big buzz about the last one ""Fast Five,"" but unfortunately I was not able to catch it. Now, this time, since Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez made the effort to come over to our country and grace this film's Premiere here last week (the first Hollywood premiere in Manila). I made it a point to watch ""F&F 6"", and I'm glad I did.Now I see what the fuss was all about, and why this franchise has lasted this long and still goes strong. The car chase scenes, on which this franchise's fame lay, were amazingly planned, executed, shot and edited. There was that chase scene on the freeway with a tank, ending with a superhuman midair rescue you simply have got to see. As if that is not enough, the entire last sequence was about cars trying to get a Russian cargo plane from taking off, all the while fighting off the enemies mostly mano a mano. I commend director Justin Lin for these ace pieces of action direction.In between these big action sequences, there are the scenes of the team led by Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker) talk about about being a family and never leaving anybody out. Among the members of the gang, Tyrese Gibson stood out as the loquacious Roman, the film's main source of comic relief. His funny one-liners also came fast and furiously hilarious. Matching big and beefy Vin Diesel is big and beefy Dwayne Johnson. The Rock plays a cop, Agent Hobbs, who sought help from Dom's and his team in apprehending another team of mercenary drivers doing terrorist errands led by Owen Shaw (played by Luke Evans). In return for their help, they asked Hobbs to work for their amnesty so they can all go back to the States, instead of hiding in countries without extradition as they are now. The unexpected return of Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who was apparently thought to have been killed in a previous episode but now was working with the enemy, provides dramatic focus for the characters, particularly Dom. Overall this is one very entertaining and exhilarating film, which I understood and appreciated well even if I have not seen any of the previous films. Well, I am sure fans who have seen all the movies will love it even more than I did since they have known and loved all these characters already. The top-notch action sequences left nothing to be desired, really breath-taking. These heart-stopping stunts are all admittedly downright ridiculous and impossible, but that was why they were all so awesome to watch.",3xHCCH,2013-05-24,2013
403,8.0,Has good as Fast Five,"Agent Hobbs(Dwayne Johnson) is hot on the trail of a gang of ruthless hijackers led by Shaw(Luke Evans) in London, and this gang is too clever, they always manage to stay two steps ahead of the law. So Hobbs figures you need criminals to catch criminals. So Hobbs ask for Toretto(Vin Diesel) and gang for help, and promises them full pardons if they succeed.The action is incredible, so where the characters, everybody plays off themselves perfectly. Luke Evans is calm, cool, villain. Dwayne Johnson really owns things up in all most every scene he's in. Vin Diesel is entertaining has Toretto. But it's Tyrese Gibson who steals the show has the nitwit of the group. It does have good fight scenes, and the car chase scenes are pretty intense.",DarkVulcan29,2013-05-27,2013

409,8.0,Damn it's furious!,"Sometimes you wonder why people watch movies in the first place. More and more I hear people bitch and moan and are critical for all the wrong reasons. Normally I encourage criticism but in this case I honestly feel the need to smack around to slap some sense back in to them. First of all The Fast and the Furious was never a film with cinematic values so high that it would challenge you or change your mindset. That it did rock some people's world was because of it's awesomeness. I know someone who got into auto tuning because of it. All his well earned money went into his car. Must have driven some parents or wives completely insane.That the Fast and The Furious had impact is a given. But let's get real. It wasn't really an intelligent movie. It was just fun and pure adrenalin. The fourth entry in the franchise for me was a sign that they needed to stop because it was nowhere near fast or furious. The fifth changed my mind and now this latest part rocked my world again. So how come a lot of people seem to be very critical all of a sudden? Exactly what were they expecting? Fast and Furious 6 is a non stop no nonsense high octane blockbuster action movie that delivers! This sixth entry is pure fan service. It has a little of everything from all the parts in the franchise. OK,there is less racing and more brutal and over the top stunts and action. How is that seen as a problem? Isn't that what we expect from a blockbuster? Hell yes! Complaining about plot and character development. Are you kidding? Sorry for getting worked up here. But see I enjoyed this film from beginning till end in such a way that I am actually looking forward to the seventh entry. I was so against any sequel made after the first two but have become a believer. Which is very rare I might add. Are there really no points I am critical about? Sure I have some points. But they aren't huge enough because this film is never pretentious. It knows it is being ridiculous and revels in it. There are many little nods back and forth to the other parts which makes it fun for the fans who have seen every part. It is also one of the few sequels where it is required to have seen previous parts otherwise you will just scratch your head and don't get the jokes (which I assume is a large group of the reviewers who complained about this one). Do yourself a favour don't act like a grandpa or grandma and let go of if a certain event is possible or not. It's a movie not reality. Fast and Furious 6 is a movie that is one of the best action movies in a long time so go watch it.",chrichtonsworld,2013-07-24,2013

411,9.0,Not Out of Milk Just Yet,"This movie has all the elements going for it than the previous film, much more emotionally involving because it's moral of family really reaching the audience. This flick consists of intense stunts that will stun the audience as well as surprisingly more exciting stunt driving. Humour wise, they solidified Tyrese Gibson as their comedic symbol churning up most of the laughs. The intro credit scene is as always attention grabbing, with a scene after the ending credits to predict another sequel. This franchise still seems fresh due to all the Fast and Furious films not having generic plots, it is not out of originality/milk yet. There are twists that will for sure surprise you and the performances are in no way stale for a pretty dumb action flick. Even though you've seen all the trailers there are still unexpected shocks. The music score is extremely modern and ""hip"" that brings every scene alive, I already have some of the soundtracks in my play list. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson again reassures the public for the 4th time this year that he is a force to be reckoned with action star. With a very epic climax it truly delivers high octane entertainment to all of it's hardcore fans. This is an extremely satisfying pre-summer flick that still has a kick-ass future ahead of it.",DMurill23,2013-05-24,2013

413,8.0,As brilliant as the 5th,"Here the brilliant means many things, the pictures, the driving, the pretty girls, the cars, and the friendship.Following the last one of this series, the 6th shows us a new competition which will be the conflict between two professional criminal team rather than our drivers and the police. The plots of the 6th are awesome but also not perfect just like its brothers, however, this kind of movies aim at showing us the dazzled cars and driving skills. There is not a big flaw I can easily find during the whole projecting, maybe it is because I paid most of my attention to the sexy girls, the cars and the extremely cool driving.At least, one thing I am sure is that this kind of film would not step into the academic awards, but it can be popular among the world, can attract plenty of fans following the series year by year. That's it, no need for anything else.For the last point I mentioned at the beginning - friendship, it is the most valuable element in this kind of movie, it's not surprise that the film like this can also teach us something important. It can be a inspiration for those directors struggling in making junk every day. So, just ust think about it dude.",JolinKnight,2013-07-07,2013
417,10.0,Amazing. (Just a quick review),"Im not going to talk too much about the film and I only have a few words.Amazing!! To start off with, from beginning to end, the film sucks you in and engages you in. The film has a serious enough plot but with the character Roman, the film manages to have its comedy element throughout. Decent story line and a good build up to the final 40 minutes of the film which is all action pretty much. Overall. The performances were great, the action was spectacular. Just a fun film to watch. So my final rating. 5/5 Stars. (10/10)Other FF movie rating's by me. The fast and the furious, 4 and a 1/2 out of 5 stars. 2fast 2furious 3/5 stars. Tokyo drift 3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars.

Fast, Stylish, Crafty and Intelligent. From the montage video in the title song (We Own It) including important scenes from all the movies (except Tokyo Drift) - the series finally connects Tokyo Drift to Fast 5. The stunt scenes including the tank are one of the best ones I have seen ever. And the emotional side of Vinn Diesel is one of the best. Its sad that they took Han and Gisele out of the equation, since they are one of the coolest people in the movie. This movie is definitely the finest Fast and Furious Movie ever. Loved it. Must Watch.",vish2407,2013-06-30,2013
427,8.0,Nice Tie in To the other fast and furious movies,"First off let me say i can't in good conscience give this movie a 10 because there is one scene in the movie they could have did a bit better. I will not spoil it for others, go see it and decide for yourself. However, I still give the movie a good review because it met my expectations: Good Action Flick, It gives you more insight on the character Hans and I felt it tied up some of the past fast and furious films together. The other fast and furious films now make more sense as an extended story after watching this latest one. The ending of the movie definitely set the franchise up for more films and I hope they continue to do good on building the storyline. Now to the critics, It is very terrible that i have read some reviews and see some people say i would give the movie a 6 but to balance the reviews that are higher than they should be I'm going to give it a 1. That is the most retarded crap i ever heard and it is those people that are making the review system faulty. Rate the movie based on how you really feel about it. You are not helping anyone make an educated decision on taking a chance to go and see the film. I feel its an eight because they built more on the storyline compared to the past fast and furious films and i also felt there was good chemistry between the actors and I really enjoyed it. Yes the movie has some faults but overall it is an enjoyable film.",icheckcheckers,2013-07-07,2013
428,1.0,"7,5 rating? This is not good","for the IMDb users community. To give a 7,5 stars to a movie full of clichés, bad acting, kid written plot and a full bucket (or a sea) of flaws is a insult to this community. Except the making of the stunts (the making, not the idea of it) the whole movie is a mess. At one moment you will think that you skipped a part of the movie: not, the script is completely chaotic. But this is democracy: unfortunately everybody can vote. Gosh, Tarkovski's ""Mirror"" got 7.9 stars! I watch this movie with a friend and we laugh like we did it to ""Naked gun"" or ""Hot shots!"" series. And this was a good news for the ""Furious 6"" if it was a parody. But is not. The producers cut ""fast"" from the title keeping ""furious"" hoping that viewers with an IQ lesser than 40 will appreciate the action. Yes, they did it. My rating? 1.",popej27,2013-07-10,2013
430,8.0,Got caught up to see what the hype was about...,"Thoroughly enjoyed this film. Totally unbelievable at times, but it's a movie for entertainment purposes. Not a documentary.I had never seen a F&F movie, so I got the DVDs (except for the Tokyo one; heard it was not so hot). I enjoyed 1, 2, 4 and 5 so I was expecting to enjoy 6. Did I ever. I love the fast cars, the sorta over-the-top machismo of the guys and the idea of family. Taking the movies from the racing scene to heists, etc. is an interesting maturing of the franchise. How many race motives can you come up with to stay interesting and relevant? Getting into the heist-action is a good turn, I think. The guys/girls are growing up and it's nice to see some change while keeping in the great fast car scenes. Dwayne Johnson is too much (in a good way) and he seems like more of a caricature of a man. He's just so dang big and ""hulking"" over anyone else. But that just adds to the fun of the movie.The photography is so good - to my eye it's flawless (and I'm always on the lookout for those details about the scene that are missed between ""cut"" and ""action""). The character development is maturing, too, as we get to know these guys through the years. The funny lines are good and some are so small & quick, you might miss 'em.Looking forward to 7 - I love it when you get involved in a movie franchise where you look forward to seeing your ""friends"" again. This is one of those for me.",coastdaze,2013-06-10,2013

I don't care what the justification is for giving this 10 stars, it doesn't deserve it. How long can you take the same plot line, roll it over and just add new characters to it? This wasn't innovative, it wasn't a reinvention, it was just a way to milk more money from people who wanted to go and see something completely different.

I am so pleased to say that the movie exceeded any of my existing expectations and did some things I didn't expect at all. Fight scenes, great stunt work, fast cars, high powered weapons, gorgeous men (and for the men, beautiful women). I suggest that you make sure that you have your drink, snacks and whatever else you need to enjoy the movie prior to it starting, because if you leave your seat, you will miss something.

It's well written and I'd say one of the best written trilogies. They have 6 about to be 7 of these and it is still awesome. Usually sequels don't last after the third one but this one is at 6 and it is still an outstanding movie. I don't know anyone who wouldn't like this movie. I also think this it one of the best movies I've seen and I can't wait for the seventh to be released but I hope the fact that it's a different director doesn't change it in any way.

Realistically it wasn't Five but everything a summer blockbuster should be. Some of the best car chases ever filmed.

The entire star cast looks well adapted to their respective character which makes the plot more believable. The action sequences are crazy! Letty returns,makes it even crazier. Inspite of such a crowded star cast,there's no confusion whatsoever throughout the movie. Gal Gadot's tragic end is touching..so is Han's. Overall,the movie may not have such a strong storyline,but it more than makes up for it with it's soul,it's 12 year old core,superb action,great actors,crazy stunts and of course,that background score.

449,8.0,"Still Fast, Still Furious, Still Entertaining","Fast and Furious has become the most awkwardly successful franchise in the history of film, and the sixth installment just adds to the insanity. Since when does a Part 6 to ANY film find any success or quality? This is an underrated first in cinematic history (Star Wars: Return of the Jedi does not count) as this testosterone-laden monolith of an action flick delivers the women, cars, action, comedy, and themes of family that has become a staple to the franchise since its subtle revival in Fast and Furious.If you have enjoyed this new direction of the Fast/Furious series then there will be nothing here that will disappoint you, from the stunts to the direction to the manly cast that makes the male viewers watching this look like Steve Urkel. The plot is a simple stop-that-man tale that involves the entire cast from Fast Five as well as a couple familiar faces from previous installments, which explains the opening sequence playing out like a flashback. The rest of the movie plays out like an extremely expensive music video with likable characters and high octane action sequences attached.What keeps the motors of this movie (and franchise overall) running is the very likable cast of characters and the connection they've developed with the dedicated fanbase. Even though certain characters like Brian and Mia (Paul Walker shines but is limited) have taken less screen time and we have more focus on Dom and Luke (Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson), they each have their moments to shine and get the audience excited. The writing doesn't totally excel but it goes straight to the point of the conflict at hand and what is at stake.But the cars and what happens to them is the heart and soul of Fast 6. Justin Lin is improving as an action director as he delivers the sequences with precise camera movement, surprisingly crisp cinematography, and enough space so that you can see the sheer scale of the mayhem occurring. While Fast Five still has the ultimate action sequence in the past half-decade, the latter action scenes will leave you breathless guaranteed.This is a very you-get-what-you-paid for film, as it doesn't quite take the franchise to the next level, but maintains delivering what you've come to expect out of these films. The beautiful women will be here, as well as the buff men, the tough-as-nails action, the beautiful cars, the good soundtrack, and a pace that matches that of a car---once the engines are running it truly takes off. While there is no evolution, there is plenty of entertainment to go around for everybody willing to watch.And do stay tuned for the credits. Just when you think that eventual next installment might be overkill, you will leave the theater excited.",diac228,2013-05-24,2013
451,5.0,Fast & Furious 6- A Consistent and Idiotic Continuation of the Franchise that Boasts Typical Adrenaline Infused Action and Stodgy Dialogue,"A key aspect in achieving success in the entertainment industry, at least in terms of obtaining a dedicated audience following, is keeping a strong sense of what defines your product's particular genre or style and confidently presenting its strengths in full force but also accepting the weaknesses presented in self-aware jest. Ever since director Justin Lin took over the Fast and Furious franchise the series has taken the route of self-aware confidence where it has embraced its strengths for nonsensical, physics defying action as well as the weakness for having leaden dialogue coming from expressionless characters and fans have been thankful for the consistency. Fast Five might have been the franchise's peak because of its tongue and cheek attitude towards its Looney Tunes environment of unrestrained adrenaline and exaggerated stunts making it difficult for any continuing sequel to match it unless the creators upgraded the storytelling parts of this clumsily custom built machine. The latest in the Fast & Furious series, eloquently named Fast & Furious 6, remains consistent to fan expectations with its fondness for stunt driven spectacle yet it exists in a plot that thinks it's far superior than it is in reality, showcasing screenwriter Chris Morgan's wrongful assumption that more dramatic breathing room between implausible action sequences gives your writing more credibility. There is an existential quandary that lives within Fast & Furious 6 as an attempt at seriousness, either in the renewed relationships or predictable plot twists, in an environment of ridiculousness practically derails this speeding vehicle from its intention on being unadulterated fun. On face and in execution the Fast & Furious films are reminiscent of experiencing a live action version of an anime cartoon (a point of view a friend of mine has reinforced) with its cartoonish embellishment of its physical environment but with far dumber plot lines and exceedingly bland dialogue so when there's less of the latter it's for the better. As guilty pleasures go there are few as technically executed as the Fast & Furious franchise and though the sixth installment showcases some of the series dumbest dialogue exchanges through purely rigid performances it remains a consistent entertainment outlet for those who have been initially conned by the fast and furious appeal.Read more: http://wp.me/py8op-yG; more reviews: generationfilm.net",generationfilm,2013-05-25,2013
452,8.0,Pure entertainment. Faster and Furiouser,"¨You don't turn your back on family, even when they do.¨Fast and Furious 6 and The Hangover Part 3 were both released today in what looks to be a tight box office race for the Memorial Day weekend. If you would have asked me a couple of years ago which film I would prefer to see, I would have definitely chosen to go see The Hangover Part 3 because I loved the first movie and thought it was a great comedy; I also enjoyed The Fast and The Furious film but wasn't too pleased with the following three sequels. Then in 2011 when both Fast Five and The Hangover Part 2 came out, things completely changed for me. I was hooked with The Fast and Furious franchise while part two of The Hangover was a major letdown. That is why this weekend I decided to go for Fast and Furious 6 without a doubt, and I wasn't disappointed. This might not be as good as the last film (which I think is the best in the franchise), but it lived up to expectations and was highly entertaining. This is Justin Lin's fourth time in the director's chair in this franchise and he seems to have had a great effect on these movies converting them into entertaining thrillers with some great action scenes. Screenwriter, Chris Morgan, is also back for the fourth time and he has managed to actually put some brains to these fast car races and create better characters. He's developed these characters very well and made them interesting, and has also done a decent job at creating some memorable villains. The film is fast paced, has several thrills, great car chases, and some decent character development. Of course there are several flaws as well: unbelievable and laughable scenes involving guys jumping off moving vehicles and landing safely all the time, and some very predictable moments and foreseeable twists. I still had a fun time with this film and laughed more than I thought I would. If you thought that Toretto (Vin Diesel) and O'Conner (Paul Walker) were retired after their latest heist in Rio, then you were wrong because Detective Hobbs (Dwayne ¨The Rock¨ Johnson) has an interesting proposition for them. He is pursuing some dangerous criminal mercenary drivers led by Shaw (Luke Evans) who have been creating chaos all over Europe. In order to stop them, Hobbs knows that he will need the help of Toretto. Hobbs discovers that Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Toretto's former love interest, is alive and working for Shaw, and therefore convinces Toretto to help him. The rest of his crew decides to come out of retirement as well and try to bring Letty back home with them. In exchange, Hobbs promises these men full pardon, and they accept without hesitation because they are tired of running and not being able to return home. Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Chris ¨Ludicrous¨ Bridges), Han (Sung Kang), and Gisele (Gal Gadot) are all back in order to help Toretto and O'Conner to stop the ruthless criminals pursuing them from London to Spain, but Shaw and his men seem to be always a step ahead of them. This sixth film in the franchise seems to tie some loose ends from the third and fourth installment in a very thrilling and entertaining way. The franchise has really picked up and it seems to have a lot of life left in it. It even ends with a cliffhanger, so it is certain that the seventh film will be coming out soon as well. Most everyone in the franchise is back again (only missing Tego Calderon and Don Omar) and the interaction between these characters is very entertaining. Ludicrous and Tyrese pretty much steal all the laughs in the scenes they are together in, while Gadot and Kang bring in the romantic touch. Toretto and O'Conner have put aside their differences from the first films and their bond is pretty strong now as they are family. Despite some of the insane and absurd action scenes, this film stands above most other action films thanks to a strong performance from the cast. This film is really a lot of fun as long as you don't think too hard of all the physical impossibilities of what they are achieving. The franchise just continues to grow faster and faster, and it works really well for a summer blockbuster movie. Fans won't be disappointed, it is a very satisfying film. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",estebangonzalez10,2013-05-24,2013

456,10.0,All eyes lead to this!,"More than a decade has passed since the first ""Fast & Furious"", still like all series this one calls for whistles, applause and OMG moments.Now, the movie sort of takes start from where it let off in the last flick. But the comparison ends then and there, this is a whole new thing.Kudos to Justin Lin for making such a fantastic movie with an amazing star cast and not to forget the beautiful yet brawny CARS. This movie is much more than an eardrum tearing acceleration sounds or big muscled people delivering punchy dialogues, this movie is more emotional yet full of action. If you thought Fast & Furious 4 was emotional, you need to see this one. All actors did their job wonderfully as expected.This is definitely one flick you should watch if you are a Fast & Furious series fan and if you are not then give it a try, you are bound to watch all of the series then. Brilliant flick, just plain brilliant.And at last there are two things worth mentioning that would increase your appetite for this movie:- (i) The scene where Dom save Letty's life is breathtaking. (ii) Do not leave your seat when the movie ends, this too like the last one has a BIG surprise.Enjoy the torque!!",siddharthkrishnadwivedi,2013-05-26,2013
458,8.0,"I wanted to hate the movie, but I've enjoyed it quite a bit","There have been interesting Furious films, there have been really bad ones and there have been good ones. The sixth part of the franchise is immensely ambitious in terms of special effects and body count, it features all the actors in the previous films, cool machines, scary villain (British, of course) and, against my better judgement, was fun! So in terms of car chase films, it was one of the better ones.This doesn't mean it was perfect. High speed chases through London, tanks killing tens of people by driving over cars, the damn American movie arithmetic that counts a victory the saving of a main character over a lesser one and the huge amount of physical violence that has to not show blood in order to be OK... all of these made me cringe at times. Also some one liners, but that was to be expected.So it is a viewer choice if the movie is good or not. Mainly it is a gang fight between ""professional criminals"", only some are uselessly cruel while the others are ""family"". I am not going to even go into tribal irony here, but you know what I mean.Bottom line: rated it above average for a movie of its kind. The music was not memorable in any way, as in other films. The chases were flamboyant, but not really focused on driver skill except a few of them. Simple, high budget movie, lacking substance, but fun.",siderite,2013-07-05,2013

464,8.0,Casey's Movie Mania: FAST & FURIOUS 6 (2013),"While it doesn't quite reaches the dizzying height of FAST FIVE in term of action sequences, FAST & FURIOUS 6 is surprisingly more fun and more entertaining than the previous five movies have come before.Just how far one can go with a franchise like THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS that originally centered on illegal street racing? In 2011, director Justin Lin and screenwriter Chris Morgan are smart enough to revitalize the series in FAST FIVE by tweaking the formula with a heist-movie undertone. Now, in this sixth installment, Lin and his company has upped their ante by turning FAST & FURIOUS 6 into a MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE-like international intrigue filled with vehicular mayhem. It's hugely ridiculous, alright but FAST & FURIOUS 6 has no doubt exceeded my expectation for being the best movie in the series I've ever seen so far.Chris Morgan's script has considerably improved this time around. All the returning cast shows more colors and winning chemistry and the jokes are funnier (especially involving Tyrese Gibson and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges). While Justin Lin can't really matches the height of FAST FIVE's action scenes, they still delivers nonetheless with each set-pieces are outrageously silly but hugely entertaining than the last.Better or improved as it may be, there are still rough patches within Chris Morgan's sometimes long-winded script -- particularly involving the convoluted revelation of Letty's back-from-the-death scenario. At times, Justin Lin tends to get overwhelmed with his hyper-kinetic direction. Some of the action scenes -- particularly hand-to-hand combat -- are mostly shot in rapid zooms and tight angles. Even the first two chase sequences during the night are sometimes hard to decipher what is really happening.Despite some of its flaws, FAST & FURIOUS 6 remains a solid action-movie blockbuster that both fans and action fans will find this a true crowd-pleaser. Likewise, don't leave the cinema yet once the credits roll. There is a mid-credit teaser that ties back the event of 2006's THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT and a revelation of a certain iconic actor who will be appeared in next July's FAST & FURIOUS 7 (which will be directed by SAW helmer James Wan).",caseymoviemania,2013-05-24,2013
465,9.0,Even better than Fast 5! Didn't think that was possible!,"Between exiting the cinema after watching the enthralling fifth entry of this fender-bending franchise and entering to watch the latest installment, most viewers would have asked an important question: has the series reached its zenith? Suffice to say, the answer to any such query is a resounding no!Fast & Furious 6, unabashedly and unreservedly, is the best iteration of the series yet. Like its predecessor, the film follows soon after events that took place in Rio de Janeiro. The crew is all displaced in non- extradition safe havens. However, after hunting the team for the length of Fast Five, DSS Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) enlists their help. The crew must apprehend a skilled group of mercenaries, led by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), in exchange for full pardons. Undertaking the mission would also allow Dom the chance to reunite with Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who has resurfaced and is now aiding and abetting Shaw.Helming his fourth consecutive entry of the series, director Justin Lin has gone from strength to strength. Lin has ameliorated as an orchestrator with the progression of each film since he joined the venture with Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. Fast 6 is grander in both scope and scale compared to its precursor. Simply put, Lin has crafted a machine running at optimal efficiency.Moreover, Lin has at his disposal an impressive ensemble, each given their moment to shine. Vin Diesel portrays Dom with ease, while Tyrese Gibson, who plays Roman Pearce, is also prominent, providing a welcome comedic element to proceedings. The banter and camaraderie shared by the characters in general is evident throughout. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, now a bona fide action star, impresses yet again with his charismatic screen presence. While Fast 6 is essentially another testosterone fueled caper, the females are also part of the action, whether it includes a physical confrontation or getting behind the wheel.Furthermore, Lin employs creativity and variety in a number of breathtaking action sequences. The flamboyant exhibition of mayhem includes vehicles such as cars, tanks and even an aircraft. The hexad episode in the series also contains exquisite cinematography. Similar to his fascination with the landscape of Rio in part five, Lin captures the vibrancy of London. The movie also benefits from a cohesive screenplay, enabling Lin to delve straight into the action, since establishing characters in unwarranted. In addition, the editing of the film is also top notch.Last but not least, Fast 6 also ties up loose ends in the franchise, such as a significant link with the anachronistic Tokyo Drift, which may have been perceived as a spin off until now. The significance of family is an underlying theme throughout the film and Lin manages to create an emotional bond with the characters as well. Fast Five may have raised the bar, setting high expectations for the future of the franchise, but Fast & Furious 6 is able to exceed those expectations emphatically. The aforementioned cast and crew ensure there are no signs of franchise fatigue. While sequels predominantly experience a decline in quality, Fast 6 proves to be an exception, perhaps similar to the Harry Potter series in its progression. All in all, Fast & Furious 6 proves that the series is operating at full throttle in the fast lane, with plenty of gas still left in the tank.",mynameisibrahim,2013-06-29,2013

470,8.0,Still going strong,"The movie is silly! The action is ridiculous! But you'll either love it or hate it. And if by now you're not sure which side you're on ... It's especially funny for me, because I'm not even into cars! But the movie and the characters we learned to love (yes even Paul Walkers ex-cop turned many other things) are there. And judging by the general vote here on IMDb, this might easily be one of the highest rated sequels and surely the highest rated entry number 6! There are a few things that even the fun part of the movie can't disguise. One of them being the relationship between Diesels character and the woman he's with. It's too convenient, not that anyone would start asking about things like that. There is also a love scene in the trailer of the movie that did not make it into the final theatrical version of the movie. It seemed too sexy anyways for a PG-13 movie.There is also a time-line thing that you have to be aware of. It's a bit complicated I guess, so while you don't have to have watched the other movies, some of them will make more sense (I think), after watching this. Especially the last one Michelle Rodriguez did (not Fast 5!). Although don't try to understand what happened there and how it's possible or anyone would think that ... well again, try not to over-think it! It's supposed to be fun! As are the action scenes!

472,8.0,"""Slow & Laborious""","Expectations were high after the inexplicably positive reaction to Fast Five. That film, was completely over the top and thoroughly cool. It seemed as though the Fast franchise was on the precipice of becoming the perfect example of straight-up popcorn cinema; unabashed, silly, and awesome. The ads for Furious 6 gave the impression we were gonna be taken to yet another level this time, (did they frickin' crash a plane with a harpoon!!?) Things were about to get even more insaner-er, i mean we talking' VE-hicular warfare. What's left to say?Unfortunately, Fast 6 is not even awesome for what it is. Yes we get a couple pretty sweet moments here and again; the highway-tank battle being the prime example. But who would've thought the sludge weighing a movie like this down would be too...much....talking. I'm serious, there's about 35 minutes of setup which covers precisely the same material the trailer compressed into about 25 seconds. This is not good for a movie like this. But this wouldn't even be much of a problem if all those interaction/""character development"" scenes were remotely interesting...or good. They are not. The first half is snore inducing, and the characters are not only unlikable, but shallow...no, I mean like even for this kind of film. A good example of this is the movie introduces another hotshot, car-driving crew, and one of the characters has to outright spell out how they are the evil dopplegangers of our favorite nice, team of criminals. The other crew of characters, even for the one-dimensional stereotypes they are, are somehow flat. There's literally not one memorable thing about any one of them.Another issue the movie struggles with is focus. We've got Toretto with his whole ""get Letty back"" plot line, we've got the Rock doing his thing, and then there's this whole subplot with Paul Walker's cop past coming back for him in prison as he's ambushed by some dudes he put away, all of which could've been an entirely separate movie. The film jumps and cuts back and forth between so many different ideas, it loses all sense of direction. And the one- liners...OMG! Suffice to say, the one-liners on the trailer are the absolute best the film has. As I said, there's a couple amusing set-piece moments, but hardly enough to offset the dullness and trudgy pace.Undemanding viewers may derive some pleasure out of Fast and Furious 6 on a completely brainless, intentionally dumb and juvenile level. But Fast Five showed us we can do better.6.0/10",danamadeus,2013-07-04,2013

477,9.0,In Response to carl-walster's Review,"I composed this originally in response to carl-walster's review of the movie. But I figured, since I've written much, I might as well post it for others to read.I'd like to comment on your review of the movie Furious 6. I really enjoyed the film so I would to give you reasons for your ""whys"".Riley fought Letty even if nobody else was looking so that if ever she successfully captured the latter, Hobbs would trust her more (remember that Hobbs and Riley just met at the start of the movie). Besides, Letty couldn't have known that Riley was working for Shaw. And about Shaw sending Riley ""to her death"", he didn't specifically send her to chase after Letty. It just happened that Riley went after Letty. Besides, Shaw was portrayed as someone who didn't care about his team personally.About your doubt about Dom's car going at high speed then drove into the plane without shooting forward, the TV series Mythbusters had proved that the physics of that scene was accurate. If you think about it, the plane was also moving so the momentum of the car (a term you mentioned in your review) did not actually diminish in an instant; it was still moving when in got to the plane (from the perspective of someone outside the plane).Then about the part where people were crushed by the tank and no one seemed fazed by it, it was not shown in the film (for obvious reasons) but surely ambulances came afterwards.I do agree though that the Military should have involved themselves in some of the situations but still there are lots of reasons I can make up why they were not there.Notwithstanding my disagreement with you, I also don't understand why Hobbs let Shaw get away when they have him to trade for Mia. He did not know she was going to be in the getaway plane. There would be no point in chasing Shaw again and capturing him if Mia was not there.However, movies should be rated, first and foremost, on their entertainment value and not for the logic behind the scenes. And I was very much entertained by the movie. It did not deserve a 5/10 rating.",arsiniryan,2013-05-26,2013

And I wonder why they bother with movies? Why not just watch Wrestling, NASCAR and cartoons? Mix that, ad few explosions, and you have Furious 6...This is a B movie that won a Jackpot and spend it all on visual effects. And underneath the sparkles it is still B movie with B movie actors, B movie script and shiny, but completely unbelievable action.Acting is wooden and most actors deliver their lines like they don't believe whats coming out of their mouths. Script is full of plot holes, plain stupidity and attacks on logic. Action scenes are just plain old fist-fighting and marshal arts bore, or elaborate stunts involving various forms of vehicles at high speeds and no considerations for laws of physics at all...I believe it's possible to make action movies that are not insulting viewers intelligence.

Despite all the pyrotechnics, I think the storyline was quite believable and the actors were well chosen. Michelle Rodriguez is striking not so much for the tough fight scenes but more so for a moral toughness. I bet she is like that in real life. The other characters were well played and fit their roles. Even though intellectually you know that the scenes can't possibly be real, your body believes it.

501,9.0,Furious Frenzy,"My mind almost exploded many times throughout this movie. Myself as well as most of the folks at Universal I'm sure are surprised this franchise has made it to the sixth installment. There is now a huge ensemble of characters from various films to keep track of as well as new ones being introduced, so it comes as a huge compliment to say I was never confused throughout 'Furious 6' (the opening title). I have not been this giddy while watching a movie in theatres since 'Transformers'. It's probably Tyrese.Granted, these are two franchises who have hardly ever tried to court realism. This movie is so Ludicrous that the audience I was with was laughing at what was being portrayed on screen. 'To think this series used to centre around street racing', I thought as a cargo plane is coming down on a military base rife with explosions.This move is accomplished several times throughout the movie. It is no less thrilling the fourth time.Vin Diesel is passable, Paul Walker is the same as usual (kinda boring). The screen time is well divided among the entire cast with everyone getting their own moments. Tyrese has become the series comic relief which I don't mind. The fights, chases and races are superbly choreographed, top notch and the best part is the movie seems pretty self-aware. It irks me to find out that the next installment will be without its main director (Justin Lin, on board since the third).There are a few faults with the movie of course as no movie is without them. The decisions made by some of the characters make almost no sense. The plausibility angle is stretched beyond breaking point, even for the series. It wasn't revealed what the McGuffin that was driving the plot was until the last 30 minutes. I imagine the writers getting so far ahead of themselves that they resorted to one upmanship handing over the script of the last scene trying to screw each other over.This is just me nitpicking though, because in a way I found it all just so confounding what was happening on screen that I couldn't help but be engaged. A series that is able to get this far while standing on its shaky and genre shifting pillars deserves to be commended. See it in theatres!Rating: +3-3 -2 -1 0 +1 +2 +3",FilmGamer,2013-06-21,2013

505,9.0,There is room for Justin Lin and the crew to blow our minds once again when they reunite for FAST 7!,"Brothers (In Laws) race down the scenic road of Canary Islands in Spain as Mia gives birth to her baby boy. Brian a father now and Dom and the rest of the wanted crew have retired since their near unbelievable heist in Rio. Settled into a good life they all have left their pasts behind them whilst still holding onto the passion of pushing the pedal to the metal. The Samoan Thor; Hobbs turns up at Doms front door seeking help to bring to justice a gang of criminals headed by a ruthless ex-mercenary by the name of Shaw. Hobbs' main vantage was a photo inside the brown case envelope that he hands to Dom which has a photo of his old flame Letty who was presumed dead in FAST & FURIOUS (The 4th Movie). If it matters to Dom it matters to his entire crew. All hands once again on deck for an even more faster and an even more furious-er FAST & FURIOUS 6. This is round 4 for Justin Lin with this franchise which is over 12 years old. For 6 years he has pushed the limits further and further toy-ing the thin boundaries of reality and fantasy. The first scene from FAST 5 and every scene from F&F 6 make me wonder if his nitrous powered franchise would burn out. Just as one may look at a Nissan GTR fly by and say ""that's unbelievable"" , the audience will not stop thinking the same but then caught up in the brilliance of the moments simply believe. How Lin and the cast does this only they can explain. I just sat their mesmerized, entertained and at the edge of my seat the whole way. The franchise has never been about a genius plot. It's always been about the grease, nuts and powerful engines roaring under the hoods. The franchise breathed new life in American Muscle Cars worldwide bringing up trends and lifestyles of street racing. F&F 6 mixes the old and the new all up once again and revisits the beginning from 12 years ago, racing for pink slips, hot pursuits and reinventing cars. Computer Generated Imagery plays a pivotal role as most of the stunts require serious if not complete CGI assistance. The distance reached out by the stunt team is massive and every minute of their effort will be worth it when you see the Dodge and the Skylines take to the streets. There is only so much I can discuss without spoiling this for you. So if you have not watched the movie as yet get to it right now. A final comparison needs to be done since FAST 5 is my all time favorite so far. Let me wrap up by saying the heist in Rio has not been outdone as yet. There is room for Justin Lin and the crew to blow our minds once again when they reunite for FAST 7! TITLE: FAST & FURIOUS 6 DIRECTED BY: JUSTIN LIN STARRING: VIN DIESEL, PAUL WALKER,DWAYNE JOHNSON, JORDANA BREWSTER, TYRESE Gibson, SUNG KANG, GAL GADOT,Ludicrous,ELSA PATAKY, GINA CARANO & Luke EVANS RATED:PG13 RATING: 8.5/10 RUNTIME: 130 MINUTES",troy-manatunga,2013-06-10,2013
507,4.0,"great action for car lovers, weak story for movie lovers","I didn't expect much better to be honest. This is the sixth 'Fast & Furious', I mean how much more can be said about a gang a villains who run around in fast cars? I enjoyed some of the visual and action, especially around central London but as far as the story and acting goes I feel it was rather weak. It's a story which has been told over and over again, the ex-villain (played by Vin Diesel) who corroborates with the police (played by Dwayne Johnson). There's nothing wrong with the plot itself, but when a movie is over two hours long you need to find a way of keeping it interesting.If you're a fan of this series then of course you should watch it, otherwise I would say don't bother.",shaunboyle1967,2013-11-26,2013

517,4.0,Disappointing,"I get movies are about entertaining the audience, I do, but I also hope to be entertained with talented casts and a good plot. The movie had some great ideas, but jus failed at portraying any realism. Many times throughout the film, the scenes were loosely connected and highly unrealistic with the main characters performing death defying acts alike an xmen or avengers...not car tuners. After a few of those, the film lost my attention. I just kept muttering, 'of course'. Also, some car scenes were forced in mindlessly having very little to do with what was happening. The movie twists and curveballs could've been better if they didn't flat out lie to the viewers. At the end, after learning the truth, a lot of scenes didn't make sense...not even a little. Then, there's the ending. Um, yeah, that could happen. I still gave the movie a 4 for the action and muscle car sound clips. This franchise always does those things well:)",jcmbruce,2013-05-25,2013
522,1.0,CGI...Meh.....story...Meh....Script....Meh Spoiler alert!,"This movie honestly made me furious!! Story- the story was awful! even though for a action movie like this, story is really secondary, but the problem is they came changing what has happened in the past just to create crappy twists. A Twist would only work if it surprises the audience but at the same time can be accepted as it make logical sense. However, all these stupid twists that made no sense and threw alway all the story viewers watched and believed in previous episodes without logical explanations is a real put off. For example we all expected and knew Letty was dead, and now they bring her back in with crappy explanation by the plot. And ever since 2006 when Tokyo drift came out, viewers believed Han was killed by that crazy jap guy, and now they are changing that too just to bring in Jason Statham?, I m sure there are many other ways to include him in the plot. There are many other stupid twists but I am sure viewers get my point.Action and stunts- For movies like this, the action and stunts can be as crazy and unrealistic as possible and no many people would complain, but the important thing is that it has to look REAL. Fast 6 used way too much CGIs and it looked awful. If we look back in to most of the previous episodes, none of them were short of crazy stunts but at least they look real such as Fast two when Paul walker drove the car into the boat, or fast 5 when Paul walker and Vin diesel drove the car off the cliff and landed into the sea, i am not sure if those stunts were really made but aleast they look as if they did and that is what satisfy me for movie likes this. CGI is fine for movies like avengers where the plot is based on a fantasy world, but i am sure for most people that follows the FnFurious serious, they watch it because they like action and cars and wanted to see crazy Stuff they don't see in real life, but to see how the movie overly use CGIs makes me feel being cheated on and was a big disappointment to me.Script- Horrible, but not as bad as the two points discussed above so not going to get into it.Lastly, was anyone put off by the overly exposed product placement of Corona beer?",wj826117,2013-06-05,2013

536,5.0,Like Watching Indian Action Movie,"I think this movie has met with its objective – a good popcorn movie. It was fun/ fast/ loud/and stylish. If you are looking for those things you will love this movie. If you look for story then look elsewhere.This movie is no longer related much to cars and engines like its predecessor but rather concentrated in action/ gun fight/ bombing. Through there are many cars chasing scenes it not really about the car anymore. (Don't they like assemble car anymore? all they do is went out to buy one) While the movie was really fun to watch many things that went on in here are just pure ridiculous that it turn to be so funny. It reminds me of watching Indian movie that no matter how beaten up or shot at - the guy is all he seem to get little bleeding at the side of his mouth. He is untouchable!!! And in the end anything will be alright. Even the dead are now undead (remind me the like of American soap opera like The Bold and the Beautiful)Another good thing about this movie is the set, it is freakishly huge!!! Involve the use of tank/plane/bike and so on. It is fun to watch that they don't seem to hold back the budget and bring about everything that they wish to get. Anyway while they did managed to make a really fun movie to watch the story and how unrealistic everything is just pure ridiculous. I recommended if you want to watch a mindless fast pace action movie.Rating: 5 /10",Mr_Sensitive,2013-06-09,2013
537,4.0,Lowest common denominator lucks out..,"Big, dumb, and sporadically fun.Fast and Furious 6 is an exploitation movie without the exploitation; the movie that puts the ridiculous into action; and the poor into acting. During the 13 hours this film went on for there are gyrating Londoners, a ludicrous story, explosions, a tank and er some cars though this is a fleeting diversion from the tedious plot, dreadful acting and banal direction.Who is this film for? Teenagers on a date who will be diverted from each other by the loud splashes of colour that assault you... sporadically.Highpoints: Luke Evans is clearly the highpoint. Though at times I expected him to say ""I would have gotten away with it to if it hadn't been for you pesky kids!"" Disappoints: Michelle Rodriguez, an actress with so much promise that seems to be deep-diving to the z-list.",stuart-573-245936,2013-05-26,2013
539,5.0,"If nothing else, it's entertaining.","I'll be honest I had never previously seen a Fast and Furious film before - shameful I know. However, despite not knowing the characters etc. I personally thought that the film was awful in many ways. the fakeness of it was unreal and having lived in London all my life its amazing to see scenes where there are no other vehicles around and so on. However, even allowing for the truly ridiculous events, I thoroughly enjoyed the film. There was never a dull moment and it was pretty unpredictable.Overall, although I thought that this was a pretty poor film I found it fairly entertaining and would recommend watching it and to be honest, even if you don't fancy it, just joking about the fake and stupid scenes and parts of the plot with my mates was enough for me to enjoy the film.",alexreyn22,2013-09-09,2013

546,4.0,Disappointing,"Overall its a disappointing movie in the franchise. The 6 movies have had a mixed bag, with tokyo drift being the best in my opinion. The cinematography and vibrant colours mixed with the culture has more to offer.But moving onto ""Fast & Furious 6"" There really is no acting in this movie. I wasn't expecting much from Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Vin Diesel, but expected more from Paul Walker (Brian). Also, some the scenes seem to be edited so much as to piece together scenes that don't mix well. On the other hand, most of the action scenes make you feel like you're chasing Shaw yourself which for me adds to the action impact. While the plot is very silly, it will get a few laughs out of you (yes it seems more of an action comedy). And the movie keeps you on the end of your seats. So if you're a fan of this franchise, or any action franchise, see it. If you're more into drama or comedy (although this movie has some of each), I suggest you see something else.",hamish-jon-mclean,2013-05-29,2013

567,7.0,I love this movie!,"I went to see this movie last night and it exceeded my expectations, most of the actions took place in London, so we all get a great guided tour for the beautiful city.A lot of people including myself are wondered about the third movie of the episodes the Tokyo Drift, it looked a bit isolate, this time the director connected the whole story dots with the Tokyo Drift and Jason Statham will play a role in the next episode as a villain, cool!We all know Mr. Vin Diesel is a muscular guy, but ""The Rock"" is getting stronger and bigger each day, he made Vin look like a normal guy and Tyrese Gibson calls him Hulk, funny! Vin you'd better work on your muscles quickly, I am worried The Rock might take your place as Riddick in the near future.To sum all things up, this movie is a fun ride, great action scenes, decent acting, and I am proud the director Justin Lin is a Taiwanese!",joechang-1,2013-05-26,2013
568,7.0,Knows its audience and works well as a result,"There is something for films that know their place in life. Sometime blockbusters will try and dress themselves up as something more worthy or important than they are but with this sixth film there is no risk of that accusation being made about the Fast & Furious franchise, because this film certainly is no under no illusions about what it needs to do. As a result we get a very simple crowd pleasing film with plenty of big ridiculous action, very easy characters and plotting and plenty to look at. This isn't to say that it isn't nonsense or that it performs in any way other than the very limited parameters it sets for itself, but at least it is honest with itself and the viewers.To speak of the strengths first, the action is not only well executed but it is also enjoyably silly in how OTT it is. At times it hurts itself by trying to make a serious moment out of a ridiculous one (such as Dominic's mid-air Matrix moment with Letty) but mostly it goes big and doesn't do anything to hide that it is just having fun and we should too. The plot really only exists to create some frame for the action and to be honest the film could have benefited from losing 20 minutes of plotting and making more room for more of what it does best. There are too many scenes of discussion between characters; in a normal film I may complain about action pushing these out, but here I think more should have been cut as really I cared for nobody and it added nothing. The plot is also full of nonsense; the 25 mile long runway is the one that people mention, but there is loads of stuff that makes no sense but mostly, like the runway, you go with it because it is dumb fun.The cast are best when they remember this too – but too often the material pushes them to try and ""act"" and few of them can. Diesel continues to lack charisma but in a way it is nice he has found something to do. Likewise Walker, not a man with much range, he seems very at home in this franchise and he is pretty I guess. Johnson is a walking mountain who has a lot of charisma and presence even though his character makes no sense. Gibson is fun, Luda is so-so and Kang is fine but oddly tragic throughout. In terms of the female roles, although there was still some gratuitous shots of models, there seemed to be fewer and less of a sense of objectifying. Rodriguez is OK but I liked the presence of Carano – not much of an actress but good physical presence. Gadot is gorgeous while Brewster is wisely left out of it as the abundance of character baggage is obvious.This is not a good film by any means – it is ridiculous in its action and really doesn't care about the plot at all, but if you feel the same way then there is much to enjoy. It could easily have lost 20 minutes of narrative and be been for it, but when the action is going on it is very easy to switch off the brain and enjoy it. Yes it is aiming its sights low and simple, but sometimes it is nice when a film is honest with you and then delivers all it promises.",bob the moo,2013-09-14,2013
570,7.0,All Roads lead to this.,"Fast and Furious 6.Well the movie carries one hell of a explosive punch. The Stunts are top notch. The Acting is petty good. If you are a fan of the Fast and Furious franchise you'll consider this one of the best in the series. If you are not a fan you won't be pleased . simple as that. I like this franchise. Right from the first one to this one. I consider them to be examples of high action and adventure done in a classic way. The story is simple. Supercop Hobbs is chasing a criminal named Shaw. Shaw uses a crew like Dom's to perform impossible robberies. Shaw is the master of the roads. Hobbs finds out that Shaw's Second in Command is Dom's lost love Letty long presumed dead. When Shaw and his crew steal a high tech Chip. Hobbes goes to Rio and recruits Dom and his team with a promise of a full pardon for them. So they can return Home. Dom pulls his team together and they get to work bring down Shaw. The theme of Fast and Furious that has been constant is family. And it is strongly put into play with this film. As Dom tells Brian. ""You don't turn your back on family. Even when they turn their back on you."" For Brian it's about getting a dangerous criminal off the streets and returning home. For Dom it's about putting his family together and resuming his life back in L.A. But it's also for Dom about the truth. nothing else matters. The film is sleek . And well done ,It's done with a style and flair you will enjoy. That is if you are a fan. If you're not a fan well check this film out anyways. It's also one hell of a crime noir film . You can forget the cars and you still have a well written well acted crime film. Vin Diesal gives a pretty sharp performance as Dom as always. Paul Walker provides the moral compass of the family. And Dwayne Johnson Provides the spark that gets them into action. Each actor in this film knows his or her job. The film ties in Fast and Furious :Tokyo drift. And it sets up the next one. The series as a whole fits into one whole story. A very impressive feat. Like I said if you're a fan of the franchise you'll enjoy it. If you're not Fan well give it a chance anyways. If you want to be surprised.",bluesman-20,2013-12-18,2013
571,7.0,Exciting mechanics,"We don't watch these for the superb insights, do we? The storytelling is mechanical and simple, recycled from spare parts of other movies, here a dark caper that owes both to Bond and Nolan. The plan is to know enough at any given moment, and very crisply, to know where we are in the larger vista, except the parts moved by the villain which carry the surprises.It's all so we can lunge ahead with what we came to see: motion mechanics.This is my go-to franchise for expertly calibrated precision in the cinematic engine. I'm not even a gearhead, the whole world with its thuggish posing is far from my sensibility. I just like to watch. The container may be simple and dumb but the pure energy it creates in the eye excites me to no end, this is stuff I want to see. Expert work in the edits, impacts, gravity. Just so you know, the editing team is headed by a guy who has worked for Bay, John Woo in M:I 2, and Tony Scott. To have these astounding stunts, it means we're going to have corresponding leaps in story logic. We do, some truly mind-numbing ones. Remember the opening of Goldeneye with Bond diving off the cliff after that plane? We have several more ridiculous stunts here—the pinnacle is perhaps the one where Diesel flies several feet in the air from a speeding car, catches in mid-air his loved one who is about to plunge to her death, and they roll together on the opposite side of the highway. (This connection between visual and logical leaps is metaphysical, but more on that in other comments)It's ludicrous of course, but I can buy it because it is the pinnacle of a very clearly mapped urge to have her back. And this is also why the stunts work so well; it's the same very clearly mapped linear narrative space, usually streets and cars snaking after each other, within that linear action space we have constant explosions in the eye—Tony Scott terrain, Unstoppable being the appex. French Connection is the template of this thing, with its big chase in three linear vistas, a film I like more because it carries the same 'real' gravity to the cop story, whereas this is M:I crazy. Which is why the finale with the plane fizzles into noise, it's just messy visual information, the sort that Bay deals in.",chaos-rampant,2013-07-21,2013
572,7.0,"fast6, then a 7?","Okay when the original ""fast and the furious"" came out i thought it was decent the acting was decent, but really, now i think that the only reason why we all go to see this series is for the women and car races. But now i feel that the series is losing its fire just like ""paranormal activity"" only Idiots and dumb people would go see that series and waste money. Anyways now the ""fast and the furious"" series is more like a adventure movie were either they get screwed over or they have to do a job for the government.I think the reason why they decided to add Statham in the mix with D'wane Johnson was to try and revive a dead story line that they screwed up on by making ""Tokyo drift"", and decided to run a prequel off that though it does end by them going to Tokyo but if the studios decide to make more i think nobody will go and see it due to the lack of interest they might have in the story if it continues",hawaiiwarrior08,2013-06-23,2013
573,7.0,"More NOS, Less Plot","What has beautiful women, fast cars, comedy, and action? No I'm not talking about a college spring break in Miami, Florida; I'm talking about the latest installment in the Fast and Furious Franchise. Last night two of my buddies and I had the privilege of seeing an early showing of Furious 6, and like always I have plenty to say. Let's get started.For those who saw Fast Five, you know that Brian (Paul Walker) and Mia (Jordana Brewster) were expecting their first child, Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew were all millionaires and Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) was ""searching"" for them. Number six picks up pretty much two months later, showing how the heist crew, minus the two demolition experts, are enjoying their well-earned rewards. In F&F world though, nothing every remains quiet for long as a ghost from the past, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) stirs the embers of intrigue and revenge in Dom resulting in the team coming together to find her. Now let's start the review.The opening of this movie is a bit slow at the beginning, but provides enough laughs and information to refresh old fans memory of the plot, while making a small foundation for those new to the series. After a ridiculous interrogation scene, a rushed planning scenes, and some more jokes later, bam we get to our first action scene. Now you might be thinking, oh great another loud sequence of cars rushing through the road sending pedestrians and bystanders dodging to the sides. For the most part you are right, but this time they are chasing after a band of mercenaries led by Luke Evans attempting to steal some government secret weapon component. While this goal is not the most unique, it's at least a slight change up to the typical motives behind the adrenaline pumping, engine roaring speed fest that we've seen for the last thirteen years. The stunts are still impressive, the cars so sleek and beautiful it hurts, and the music so aggressive that it blends into an exciting ride. Of course this wouldn't be worthy of being an F&F movie if there was only one chase scene right Don't worry number six has a few more car scenes that continue to show off the world of stunt driving, CGI and mediocre plots centered around finding ways to make cars go fast.One should note though that the action isn't just limited to cars. Nope F&F6 opens has taken the liberty to add more diversity in their butt kicking arsenal. With the Rock taking more screen time, fans get to see a few more fist fights and body slamming that allows you to see what the Rock is cooking. When Johnson isn't putting the hurt on someone, the rest of the gang takes their shots at either putting a cap in someone, or pulling out some martial arts skills to defeat their opponents. Some of these fights rock, while others are merely meant to have you laughing as the heroes throw out witty banter. Despite some of the ridiculousness and over the top stunts, the action will still have action fans on the edge of their seats, hooting for their favorite characters.Putting the action aside though, the movie does have other qualities that help balance things out. For one thing the comedy in this movie is still strong, especially when Roman (Tyrese Gibson) takes the stage. The feisty, self-involved, ladies' man is the center of the comedic pillar pulling all the other characters in to a friendly rivalry that symbolizes the brotherhood between the team. From my standpoint, I think Gibson must make these jokes daily, as the acting made it seem that it was just an ordinary day, especially when going toe to toe with Tej (Ludacris).For me the comedy also helped make up for some of the plot holes this movie had. The lack of reasoning behind Evans attacks left me feeling as this guy was just crazy. The plot revolving around Dom and Letty though was the better developed of the story, with much of the movie focusing on the internal struggles occurring between the two. While the romance is not my favorite part, the movie does a good job not rubbing love in my face, and actually uses the plot to bring in other ghosts from the pasts to strengthen the movie. Laughs and love aside, the movie also does a nice job keeping you on your toes as to who will survive the ordeal. Many times there are close calls where you are not sure if someone will live, and yes there are even some deaths that upset my friends, despite how predictable it was. All in all though, the plot isn't the worst thing I've seen, it just was lacking in some areas that I felt failed where the fifth one succeeded. Luckily we still have a nice balance of characters/actors in the movie, with the exception of a few who took a major back seat to Dom and Letty, (i.e. Mia, Tej, and Elena). While the action was impressive, the camera work still had a few spastic moments that were either a bit dizzying or a bit annoying. As for the villain, again the guy had skills and a lethal team, but they failed to really build him up or give him some pizazz to make him stand out as a great bad guy. Regardless F&F6 is a good movie and keeps the series alive for at least one more movie to come, watch the credits. Acting is just like before, the action is still rip roaring fun, and the comedy is golden to keep you laughing the whole time. Yet some weaknesses in plot and centering on Letty/Dom hindered this movie to make it less enjoyable for me. My scores are below: Action/Crime/Thriller: 7.5 Movie: 7.0",rgkarim,2013-05-24,2013
