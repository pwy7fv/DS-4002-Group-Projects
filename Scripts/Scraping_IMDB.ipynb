            "<div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Is it cheesy ? Definitely. Is it corny ? Oh ya. Did anyone deserve an Oscar? What do you think.<br/><br/>Is it a cultural icon that has had a decades long lasting impact on pop culture worth your time ? ABSOLUTELY.<br/><br/>Back in 2001 this movie was the next big thing. Everyone wanted a graphic'd out rice burner to drive around town in pretending they street raced.<br/><br/>Everyone wanted a Mia or Letty. Everyone wanted to have Dom's muscles and Brian's hair.<br/><br/>There's not enough to say about how this movie changed everyone in 2001. Just watch it yourself and put yourself in the mindset of 2001.</div>\n",
            "<div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Every summer a film comes around that takes everyone by surprise.  Last year it was Scary Movie and I'm sure in 1977 it was a film like Star Wars and then in 1981 it was Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Now I am not saying that The Fast and the Furious is in the same class as Raiders and Star Wars, just that it surprised everyone on the same level.  F&amp;F is short on plot and dialogue and even some of the acting is lame, but what it is oozes is testosterone.  It pumps your blood, increases your adrenaline and attacks you with fast cars, sexy women and that one invariable that I think it has going for it... Vin Diesel.  There is just something about the guy, something that you really can't put your finger on, but he just has it. Maybe it is charisma, maybe it is charm, maybe it is just that he resembles some of the action heroes from the 80's with his chiseled triceps and his slabs of pecs.  Maybe it is all those things and maybe it is none of those things, all I know is that F&amp;F is exactly what I had hoped it would be and nothing more.  This is the summer movie that I have been waiting for.  It's not that the films that have been out so far aren't that great because some of them are, it's just that this is the one that epitomises what summer as a teen ager is all about.  It is no wonder that exit polls for this film were around 65-70% under the age of 21.  And maybe that is why I enjoyed it so much.  I am pushing 30 but isn't it cool to lose yourself in a film that reminds you what it was like to be in highschool.  And isn't it cool to watch street racers break 140 miles an hour wile they shoot NOS through their vehicles?  Well isn't it?<br/><br/>F&amp;F doesn't contain any machinations similar to a film like Mission Impossible and it doesn't dazzle us with special effects of impending doom like Armageddon did, but it takes us into a world where people live life \"a quarter of a mile at a time.\"  <br/><br/>Vin Diesel plays Dominic Toretto, a massive, bald mechanic that owns a garage but street races on the side to make some extra cash.  Paul Walker ( The Skulls, Varsity Blues) plays Brian Spindler.  He is a cop that has infiltrated the street gang to find out who is highjacking trucks and stealing all their merchandise.  There are about four rival street gangs in L.A. and one of them is pulling this off.  He has to figure out which one. Of course along the way he seduced by the life, but that is not what we really care about.  All we want to see is lots of racing, a few crashes, some fights and some sex.  F&amp;F doesn't disappoint.  If what you have seen in the trailers of the film excites and entices you, then you know exactly what you're in for.  This is not going to win any Oscars for anything but what it will do is entertain you.  It will expedite you for 90 minutes into a world where Honda's are souped up to look like Dragons and junkyard scraps are rebuilt from scratch to be better than they were before, better, stronger and faster.  If this film appealed to you in the commercial, it will appeal to you on the screen.<br/><br/>And of course there is Vin Diesel.  He first made a name for himself in Saving Private Ryan where he played Capparrzo.  Then he jumped onto the scene with his excellent and grandiose turn as Riddick in Pitch Black.  I think this is the film that got him noticed because no one had even heard of him before this.  Then he did Boiler Room and he showed a different side to him.  But F&amp;F is all muscle and sheer bravado.  I think Vin is going to do great things in the years to come.  He is not a nobody anymore.  This film will take care of that.  And face it, isn't it cool to see the genesis of a new action hero?  <br/><br/>8 out of 10-  The ultimate summer rush!</div>\n",
            "<div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">This is the movie that created a brand new mega movie franchise. Generally when there's movie franchises they make movies in the form of trilogies. But later this year when Fast and the Furious 6 comes out it'll be the sixth movie in the series which shows the level of box office appeal the series has to be able to pump out an average of 1 movie every two years is quite impressive. The only other series doing that kind of productivity with different directors on basically a once every 2 year rate is the James Bond series.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel who outside of his other series Riddick movies generally puts out mediocre to bad performances was basically made to play the role of Dominic Torretto. Same goes for Paul Walker, normally when I see he's going to be in a movie I don't bother watching it. But somehow when these 2 guys get together in a movie about driving fast cars with hot girls it turns into a guilty pleasure.</div>\n",
            "<div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Officer Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) goes undercover in the Los Angeles street racing circuits in order to find out which of the racing crews is committing crimes with their muscle cars. But going undercover is never easy, especially with such affable miscreants.<br/><br/>The basic premise is really nothing special. But then again, it doesn't need to be. The point of this movie is in its style. It has fast cars, lots of racing, lots of hot, greased-up babes, muscle-heavy men (and cars) and a killer soundtrack. You don't watch it to be intrigued by carefully orchestrated plot points or tragic backstories or the heaviness of its pathos. No, you watch it to kick back, relax and have a good time.<br/><br/>And in delivering that, the movie more than delivers. But if it was just that, I'd probably rate the film a bit lower. What actually elevates this film above its immediate peers and helped launch a huge franchise, is the fact that this film is punching above its weight class and succeeding. And it does that by having some real good actors playing roles they were born to play. Walker is one of them, but I also have to mention Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez.<br/><br/>The dialogue is also surprisingly snappy and memorable. The plot, while basic, succeeds in making you care for these characters, and it also manages to make itself feel novel, despite arguably being at least a little clichéd. Once again, the fact that you care for these characters matters a lot.<br/><br/>Not a groundbreaking movie by any means, but it has surprising quality underneath all the testosterone being forcibly pumped into your veins.</div>\n",
            "<div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">The Fast and the Furious (2001) It is solid decent action film of the film franchise. I love this film it is my third favorite film in the series. I wasn't watching this film for the cars or street races this film is about robbery, as a string of high-speed electronics truck robberies rocks the area. The Team stole $1.2 million worth of major electronics and the cops doesn't have any leads who has done it. There is only one team that could be responsible, Dominic Torreto (Vin Diesel) and his gang of street racers. During the night Torreto and his crew of street racers are driving cars in Los Angeles. Brian O'Conner (Paul walker) a undercover LAPD officer under the alias \"Brian Earl Spilner\", is he assigned to find out who is stealing the merchandise. <br/><br/>This is my favorite film, it is an decent Action film about heist $1.2 million and not about the cars. Why I love this film? Because It is clever, intelligent, Entertained, fast paced and not boring film. The girls are beautiful in this team. The Action sequences are real and perfectly done. I love that late Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner and undercover L.A. Police Officer who try's to do the right thing. I am Paul Walker fan and Brian O'Conner is my favorite character of the whole franchise and series. I am saying The Fast and the Furious is better than 2,3 and even 7 so the film is pretty good.<br/><br/>Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster did a terrific job playing their characters.With these players set in motion, it's up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. (One often sees great performances in mediocre films..here the story transcends the performances -- an impressive feat.) The script delivers. These themes are reinforced by the fine performances by Paul Walker and, particularly, Vin Diesel. Diesel's Toretto is a tough, no-nonsense, street-smart and highly-skilled racer on the outside, but as O'Conner and the audience come to know him, it is revealed that he is a human being with feelings, a troubled and hard past, and doing his best to get along, even if it means skirting or breaking the law. He's the head of a household, and the patriarch of sorts of a gang that is more family than it is a collection of members. Diesel brings hard-nosed and gritty energy to the role, but compliments that with a softer, more accessible side that makes him an odd sort of antihero, a man clearly in the wrong but not maliciously or spitefully so. Walker, too, is excellent as the undercover officer that finds the world of underground racing not-so-seedy as it seems. <br/><br/>On the turbo-charged streets of Los Angeles, every night is a championship race. With intense full-throttle action, awesome high-speed stunts, and full-on pedal to the metal intensity, this fast and furious assault puts you in the driver's seat and dares you to exceed all limits.Los Angeles police officer Brian O'Connor must decide where his loyalties really lie when he becomes enamored with the street racing world he has been sent undercover to destroy.<br/><br/>It don't matter if you win by an inch or a mile. Winning's winning. <br/><br/>The Fast and the Furious is a gritty and gratifying cheap thrill, Rob Cohen's high-octane hot-car is a true rarity these days, a really good exploitation, the sort of thing that would rule at drive-ins if they still existed. The Fast and the Furious is a good Action movie. It offers a conventional plot but populates the story with well-developed primary characters that draw the audience in and make them care about their stories. In the movie, the line between good and bad becomes blurred to the point that, by the end, it matters not which side of the law the characters call home.<br/><br/>I love this film to death! It is my 3d favorite film in the series franchise. The Fast and the Furious kicks ass! Even for PG-13 film they kick ass! Brian O'Conner kicks ass!!!</div>\n",
            "<div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">What makes this film so great? One of the many questions you find asking yourself as soon as you pick up the DVD or Video of this film. Well firstly before you dare to watch this film you must be one of these three types of people to be able to sit and watch this film (in my opinion) 1)A person who knows fast cars, 2)A person who likes to see these cars, and 3)A person who knows why you race them.<br/><br/>If you aren't one of these people and just want to watch Vin and Paul in action then I'm afraid to tell you that you won't do this film any justice (although they are great in this film). I believe that the character that Vin plays was made for him and so was Pauls' character. Vin already has the style, the mood of Dominic Tretto (we have seen this in XXX) i personally couldn't have picked a better actor for the job for no one could pull it off like what Vin does. As for Paul i think it's great that they have used a so-called \"tall, lean, blonde pretty-boy\" for the part of Brian O'Conner because it brings out the fact that he is an under-cover cop. He's new in the field, it's his first mission and therefore he needs to look it too. We see his character evolve in the second film, which is also truly brilliant. So from me i think that the film should be at least rated at a 7 or 8 out of 10 even though the story does seem to drag on for awhile it is still a pretty good film and i hope you will agree. So from me watch this film and enjoy it too.</div>\n",
            "<div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">The Fast and the Furious is probably the first movie to get me into cars while at the same time enjoying myself without having to worry about a plot.<br/><br/>Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner, a hot shot police officer, who goes undercover as a car junkie Brian Spilner to see if a local street racer/mechanic by the name of Dominic Toretto (Vin Diseal) has anything to do with hijacking a bunch of cargo from DVD's, TV's, entertainment sets, and so forth while at the same time falling head over heels for Dominic's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster). Brian comes so close while at the same time gaining trust to the target (Dominic) itself where it's only a matter of time before the truth comes out.<br/><br/>The film itself has the best action sequences involving street racing and high octane action where despite a so-so plot to follow, or one that's been seen before (such as Point Break), you don't have to worry about a thing. It's just pure fun.<br/><br/>The film also stars Michelle Rodriguez (S.W.A.T.) as Dominic's girlfriend, Letty; Ted Levine (The Silence of the Lambs) as Sgt. Tanner, and singer Ja Rule in a small cameo as a contestant against Dominic.</div>\n",
            "<div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Today I saw Tokyo drift and yesterday I saw 2 fast 2 furious for the fifth time, but I still find myself drawn toward the original. It stars Paul Walker as an undercover cop who infiltrates the street racing underworld of LA to catch a crook who has been hijacking millions of dollars worth of electronics from 18wheelers, causing the truckers to take matters into their own hands, ultimately ending in deaths and multitudes of money stolen. Now, you would think that because of the semi weak plot, this movie wouldn't be that good, however, the main storyline is just a small part of this movie, the other elements being action and some interesting relationships regarding vin diesels character. Diesel plays a street racing god, one of the best in the LA scene. Walkers character, Brians, way into the world is through Dominic Toretto (Diesel). Toretto has an air about him which draws other in, and Brian is no different. Throughout the movie, Brian is getting to know Dom, earning his trust, etc, but at the end of the movie, both Dom and Brian are forced to make a decision about each other... The whole relationship is interesting to watch. As for the action, there is plenty of it. Besides the many races, there is also some gunplay and some hand to hand fighting, and some interesting hijacking sequences.<br/><br/>All in all the cars are hot, the girls are hotter, the cars are fast, the guns are loaded, and for the more serious, the relationship between Dom, Mia, Vince, Letty, and the others is amazing.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, rent it tonight</div>\n",
            "<div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) leads a group of friends and family to street race in the LA night. Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) is a cop working undercover to infiltrate his gang of suspected truck robberies. However he finds himself falling under Dominic's charisma and for Dominic's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster).<br/><br/>There is a lot of silly action, and unrealistic story lines. This is purely style winning over substance. The cars look cool and babes look hot. But it's the Vin Diesel presence and Paul Walker pretty boy looks that provide the heart of this movie. The boys have amazing chemistry and the gang feels like a real family. The story is almost unnecessary.</div>\n",
            "<div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Could there be a movie made in this world worse than this one? Of course there is but this is still a shocking movie. What chance does a remake of \"Point Break\" seriously have? Neither contained a script worth performing, let alone an idea with originality. They both produced ordinary performances from the cast of alleged actors. They also both contained action scenes that were so ridiculous you could only smile at the the disgraceful way money is handed out to pretenders, sorry producers to make this crap.<br/><br/>At least \"Point Break\" mixed the action scenes between sky diving and surfing rather than the mundane street racing over an over. Maybe they could have towed someone on roller skates behind the cars for extra adrenaline.</div>\n",
            "<div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">I don't remember when the first time was that I saw The Fast and the Furious but it dosen't matter because it gets better with each viewing. This movie is filled with what guys want to see; Hot and fast tricked out cars, beautiful women, and kick ass action sequences. The world that the characters live in in this film is the world we can only dream of, to race in cool tricked out cars with dozens of beautiful women surrounding you and cheering you on. All of this is what I love most about this film but I also love the cast; Vin Diesal, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster all clinch their roles. If I were to pick my favorite cast member I would have to go with Michelle Rodriguez because not only is she a talented actress she is beautiful and bad ass in everything she's ever been in and this is probably my favorite role of hers. This is a movie were you really don't have to care about the plot because all the eye-candy and fun of this movie is the cars, girls, and action which is enough to pull you into the driver's seat. The cars are fast the action is furious and that's why this movie rocks.</div>\n",
            "<div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Rob Cohen's \"The Fast and the Furious\" has no business being as great as it is. A film about fast cars, undercover cops, and highway robbery should provide limited, perhaps dimwitted thrills, but Cohen's colorful and swift-paced action outing provides such likable characters, slick stunts, and buoyant spirit that the whole affair elevates itself to the highest levels of lively, well-assembled fun. It is a surprisingly robust and satisfying experience.<br/><br/>The film follows an undercover police officer working to infiltrate the world of street racing to bust a low-level crime syndicate. While undercover, he develops an affinity toward the racers and inconvenient brotherhood is established. Between the cars, busts, and friendships, a token crime story becomes a tale of family. It is simply compelling and effortlessly entertaining.<br/><br/>Cohen creates a multi-ethnic world of sunshine, turbo charged technology, and well-rendered characters. It is a Los Angeles of beautiful paint jobs, palm trees, and lived-in locations. Color, verve, and speed burst forth from Cohen's frames in layered and lively compositions. Editing, design, and music create an always- pulsing energy that permeates every sequence.<br/><br/>Though the film is about racing and the thrills that drive the sport, Cohen cast actors that earn as much attention as the horse- powered rockets. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Chad Lindberg, and Michelle Rodriguez form the family unit the inspires the film's themes and emotions. Each actor builds a solid character, with the leads being especially memorable. Diesel glowers and Walker exudes a naive charm. They form a charismatic duo.<br/><br/>A slick and undeniably entertaining action gem, \"The Fast and the Furious\" soars with its combination of character and thrills. Set pieces are exciting, character beats are affecting, and the stunts are electrifying. It is a remarkable, sweat, oil, and sun-soaked piece of work.</div>\n",
            "<div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) wants to join the family of the head of California street racing (Vin Diesel)...but why?<br/><br/>The plot is comic book level; the dialogue is very VERY bad...but who really cares?  This is a throwback of those dumb 1970s drive-in movies...it's for people who like loud, fast films filled with mindless action, attractive women, cars...and nothing else.  I didn't like the film.  It was too loud, too silly and way too long for a dumb action flick.  What saves it is some truly incredible action sequences (the \"hijacking\" sequence towards the end was unbelievable), some very nice, innovative direction, a cast that manages to be good despite the script and a very good performance by Vin Diesel. This was supposed to be Walker's breakthrough film but Diesel steals it away.  Also it looks kind of silly to have tall, lean, pretty boy Walker against tall, muscular, severe-looking Diesel.<br/><br/>See it for the action and Diesel.  During the slow spots admire the cars or the women.</div>\n",
            "<div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">The most traumatizing installment but very enjoyable none the less! I love so much of the film, the colors, cars, dialogue, and the fun vibes. Such a great movie, it's been many years since I've seen it. The motorcycle gang is such an annoyance to the plot would've been better without them.</div>\n",
            "<div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">This film is a humble introduction to the world of The Fast and The Furious, a far cry from what the series would become. It starts off with some lovable characters and some street races. The scale of this film is smaller than most of the sequels but it has more heart.</div>\n",
            "<div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">This is a great movie. Far from being superficial pulp, this movie has a complex plot. Vin Diesel's performance is tremendous; his screen presence is dominating. He succeeds in carrying the movie. Although the movie contains lots of glitz, it also tells a story that deals with themes such as loyalty and betrayal. The rest of the cast is excellent too, especially Jordana Brewster and Paul Walker. Michelle Rodriguez is as usual wonderful. It would be easy to dismiss this movie as being little more than a live action cartoon, but the movie really is full of surprises. It has several intensely dramatic scenes, some of the most incredible car chase scenes, and some deeply esoteric verbal exchanges fraught with emotion. Whether it's Vin Diesel pouting or Paul Walker being heroic, the results are same: nonstop action, intense dialog, and interesting characters, all of which together produce great entertainment. It's more than just about automobiles.</div>\n",
            "<div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">The Fast and the Furious is a car culture movie that created an action cinematic universe. So many meme lines and amazing car action are packed into this pre-9/11, Y2K time capsule. It's always fun to see where the Fast Franchise began and the birth of series staples, back when Dom still appeared mortal.<br/><br/>Point Break with cars is NOS when you infuse it with an Attitude Era type of style.

            "<div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">I saw this movie first in 2003 and was instantly sucked into the series, i've seen fast five and fast six which did this movie justice but i don't think they can duplicate the feeling i get from watching this film. it feels so much like the time period it was shot in and the chemistry all the main street racers share in the middle of this movie feels gone forever. i recently watched this movie again after Paul walker died because i feel that was the final nail in the coffin on my hope for seeing another movie that felt like this. i like all f and f movies in the series especially the newest ones which are surprisingly more entertaining to me and that 2fast and Tokyo drift but the new ones are like their own movie without the same flow just like this movie is and I'm sad to see it pretty much gone forever but at least they created the new movies and created them well so we have more than just the first few rip Paul walker.</div>\n",
            "<div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">\"The Fast and Furious\", adapted from a magazine article, could have been adapted from a comic book. With a simple minded plot,  some pretty awful acting by just about everyone (Diesel excepted), and the usual Hollywood excesses pushing the PG-13 envelope, \"The Fast...\" gets off on high octane street racing. From cool cars to hot babes this flick is made with one goal in mind: to separate the teen male from the price of admission. Not for mature audiences.</div>\n",

            "Review Text: Every summer a film comes around that takes everyone by surprise.  Last year it was Scary Movie and I'm sure in 1977 it was a film like Star Wars and then in 1981 it was Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Now I am not saying that The Fast and the Furious is in the same class as Raiders and Star Wars, just that it surprised everyone on the same level.  F&F is short on plot and dialogue and even some of the acting is lame, but what it is oozes is testosterone.  It pumps your blood, increases your adrenaline and attacks you with fast cars, sexy women and that one invariable that I think it has going for it... Vin Diesel.  There is just something about the guy, something that you really can't put your finger on, but he just has it. Maybe it is charisma, maybe it is charm, maybe it is just that he resembles some of the action heroes from the 80's with his chiseled triceps and his slabs of pecs.  Maybe it is all those things and maybe it is none of those things, all I know is that F&F is exactly what I had hoped it would be and nothing more.  This is the summer movie that I have been waiting for.  It's not that the films that have been out so far aren't that great because some of them are, it's just that this is the one that epitomises what summer as a teen ager is all about.  It is no wonder that exit polls for this film were around 65-70% under the age of 21.  And maybe that is why I enjoyed it so much.  I am pushing 30 but isn't it cool to lose yourself in a film that reminds you what it was like to be in highschool.  And isn't it cool to watch street racers break 140 miles an hour wile they shoot NOS through their vehicles?  Well isn't it?F&F doesn't contain any machinations similar to a film like Mission Impossible and it doesn't dazzle us with special effects of impending doom like Armageddon did, but it takes us into a world where people live life \"a quarter of a mile at a time.\"  Vin Diesel plays Dominic Toretto, a massive, bald mechanic that owns a garage but street races on the side to make some extra cash.  Paul Walker ( The Skulls, Varsity Blues) plays Brian Spindler.  He is a cop that has infiltrated the street gang to find out who is highjacking trucks and stealing all their merchandise.  There are about four rival street gangs in L.A. and one of them is pulling this off.  He has to figure out which one. Of course along the way he seduced by the life, but that is not what we really care about.  All we want to see is lots of racing, a few crashes, some fights and some sex.  F&F doesn't disappoint.  If what you have seen in the trailers of the film excites and entices you, then you know exactly what you're in for.  This is not going to win any Oscars for anything but what it will do is entertain you.  It will expedite you for 90 minutes into a world where Honda's are souped up to look like Dragons and junkyard scraps are rebuilt from scratch to be better than they were before, better, stronger and faster.  If this film appealed to you in the commercial, it will appeal to you on the screen.And of course there is Vin Diesel.  He first made a name for himself in Saving Private Ryan where he played Capparrzo.  Then he jumped onto the scene with his excellent and grandiose turn as Riddick in Pitch Black.  I think this is the film that got him noticed because no one had even heard of him before this.  Then he did Boiler Room and he showed a different side to him.  But F&F is all muscle and sheer bravado.  I think Vin is going to do great things in the years to come.  He is not a nobody anymore.  This film will take care of that.  And face it, isn't it cool to see the genesis of a new action hero?  8 out of 10-  The ultimate summer rush!\n",

But later this year when Fast and the Furious 6 comes out it'll be the sixth movie in the series which shows the level of box office appeal the series has to be able to pump out an average of 1 movie every two years is quite impressive. The only other series doing that kind of productivity with different directors on basically a once every 2 year rate is the James Bond series.Vin Diesel who outside of his other series Riddick movies generally puts out mediocre to bad performances was basically made to play the role of Dominic Torretto. Same goes for Paul Walker, normally when I see he's going to be in a movie I don't bother watching it. But somehow when these 2 guys get together in a movie about driving fast cars with hot girls it turns into a guilty pleasure.\n",

            "Review Text: Officer Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) goes undercover in the Los Angeles street racing circuits in order to find out which of the racing crews is committing crimes with their muscle cars. But going undercover is never easy, especially with such affable miscreants.The basic premise is really nothing special. But then again, it doesn't need to be. The point of this movie is in its style. It has fast cars, lots of racing, lots of hot, greased-up babes, muscle-heavy men (and cars) and a killer soundtrack. You don't watch it to be intrigued by carefully orchestrated plot points or tragic backstories or the heaviness of its pathos. No, you watch it to kick back, relax and have a good time.And in delivering that, the movie more than delivers. But if it was just that, I'd probably rate the film a bit lower. What actually elevates this film above its immediate peers and helped launch a huge franchise, is the fact that this film is punching above its weight class and succeeding. And it does that by having some real good actors playing roles they were born to play. Walker is one of them, but I also have to mention Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez.The dialogue is also surprisingly snappy and memorable. The plot, while basic, succeeds in making you care for these characters, and it also manages to make itself feel novel, despite arguably being at least a little clichéd. Once again, the fact that you care for these characters matters a lot.Not a groundbreaking movie by any means, but it has surprising quality underneath all the testosterone being forcibly pumped into your veins.\n",

            "Review Text: The Fast and the Furious (2001) It is solid decent action film of the film franchise. I love this film it is my third favorite film in the series. I wasn't watching this film for the cars or street races this film is about robbery, as a string of high-speed electronics truck robberies rocks the area. The Team stole $1.2 million worth of major electronics and the cops doesn't have any leads who has done it. There is only one team that could be responsible, Dominic Torreto (Vin Diesel) and his gang of street racers. During the night Torreto and his crew of street racers are driving cars in Los Angeles. Brian O'Conner (Paul walker) a undercover LAPD officer under the alias \"Brian Earl Spilner\", is he assigned to find out who is stealing the merchandise. This is my favorite film, it is an decent Action film about heist $1.2 million and not about the cars. Why I love this film? Because It is clever, intelligent, Entertained, fast paced and not boring film. The girls are beautiful in this team. The Action sequences are real and perfectly done. I love that late Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner and undercover L.A. Police Officer who try's to do the right thing. I am Paul Walker fan and Brian O'Conner is my favorite character of the whole franchise and series. I am saying The Fast and the Furious is better than 2,3 and even 7 so the film is pretty good.Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster did a terrific job playing their characters.With these players set in motion, it's up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. (One often sees great performances in mediocre films..here the story transcends the performances -- an impressive feat.) The script delivers. These themes are reinforced by the fine performances by Paul Walker and, particularly, Vin Diesel. Diesel's Toretto is a tough, no-nonsense, street-smart and highly-skilled racer on the outside, but as O'Conner and the audience come to know him, it is revealed that he is a human being with feelings, a troubled and hard past, and doing his best to get along, even if it means skirting or breaking the law. He's the head of a household, and the patriarch of sorts of a gang that is more family than it is a collection of members. Diesel brings hard-nosed and gritty energy to the role, but compliments that with a softer, more accessible side that makes him an odd sort of antihero, a man clearly in the wrong but not maliciously or spitefully so. Walker, too, is excellent as the undercover officer that finds the world of underground racing not-so-seedy as it seems. On the turbo-charged streets of Los Angeles, every night is a championship race. With intense full-throttle action, awesome high-speed stunts, and full-on pedal to the metal intensity, this fast and furious assault puts you in the driver's seat and dares you to exceed all limits.Los Angeles police officer Brian O'Connor must decide where his loyalties really lie when he becomes enamored with the street racing world he has been sent undercover to destroy.It don't matter if you win by an inch or a mile. Winning's winning. The Fast and the Furious is a gritty and gratifying cheap thrill, Rob Cohen's high-octane hot-car is a true rarity these days, a really good exploitation, the sort of thing that would rule at drive-ins if they still existed. The Fast and the Furious is a good Action movie. It offers a conventional plot but populates the story with well-developed primary characters that draw the audience in and make them care about their stories. In the movie, the line between good and bad becomes blurred to the point that, by the end, it matters not which side of the law the characters call home.I love this film to death! It is my 3d favorite film in the series franchise. The Fast and the Furious kicks ass! Even for PG-13 film they kick ass! Brian O'Conner kicks ass!!!\n",

            "Review Text: What makes this film so great? One of the many questions you find asking yourself as soon as you pick up the DVD or Video of this film. Well firstly before you dare to watch this film you must be one of these three types of people to be able to sit and watch this film (in my opinion) 1)A person who knows fast cars, 2)A person who likes to see these cars, and 3)A person who knows why you race them.If you aren't one of these people and just want to watch Vin and Paul in action then I'm afraid to tell you that you won't do this film any justice (although they are great in this film). I believe that the character that Vin plays was made for him and so was Pauls' character. Vin already has the style, the mood of Dominic Tretto (we have seen this in XXX) i personally couldn't have picked a better actor for the job for no one could pull it off like what Vin does. As for Paul i think it's great that they have used a so-called \"tall, lean, blonde pretty-boy\" for the part of Brian O'Conner because it brings out the fact that he is an under-cover cop. He's new in the field, it's his first mission and therefore he needs to look it too. We see his character evolve in the second film, which is also truly brilliant. So from me i think that the film should be at least rated at a 7 or 8 out of 10 even though the story does seem to drag on for awhile it is still a pretty good film and i hope you will agree. So from me watch this film and enjoy it too.\n",

            "Review Text: The Fast and the Furious is probably the first movie to get me into cars while at the same time enjoying myself without having to worry about a plot.Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner, a hot shot police officer, who goes undercover as a car junkie Brian Spilner to see if a local street racer/mechanic by the name of Dominic Toretto (Vin Diseal) has anything to do with hijacking a bunch of cargo from DVD's, TV's, entertainment sets, and so forth while at the same time falling head over heels for Dominic's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster). Brian comes so close while at the same time gaining trust to the target (Dominic) itself where it's only a matter of time before the truth comes out.The film itself has the best action sequences involving street racing and high octane action where despite a so-so plot to follow, or one that's been seen before (such as Point Break), you don't have to worry about a thing. It's just pure fun.The film also stars Michelle Rodriguez (S.W.A.T.) as Dominic's girlfriend, Letty; Ted Levine (The Silence of the Lambs) as Sgt. Tanner, and singer Ja Rule in a small cameo as a contestant against Dominic.\n",

            "Review Text: Today I saw Tokyo drift and yesterday I saw 2 fast 2 furious for the fifth time, but I still find myself drawn toward the original. It stars Paul Walker as an undercover cop who infiltrates the street racing underworld of LA to catch a crook who has been hijacking millions of dollars worth of electronics from 18wheelers, causing the truckers to take matters into their own hands, ultimately ending in deaths and multitudes of money stolen. Now, you would think that because of the semi weak plot, this movie wouldn't be that good, however, the main storyline is just a small part of this movie, the other elements being action and some interesting relationships regarding vin diesels character. Diesel plays a street racing god, one of the best in the LA scene. Walkers character, Brians, way into the world is through Dominic Toretto (Diesel). Toretto has an air about him which draws other in, and Brian is no different. Throughout the movie, Brian is getting to know Dom, earning his trust, etc, but at the end of the movie, both Dom and Brian are forced to make a decision about each other... The whole relationship is interesting to watch. As for the action, there is plenty of it. Besides the many races, there is also some gunplay and some hand to hand fighting, and some interesting hijacking sequences.All in all the cars are hot, the girls are hotter, the cars are fast, the guns are loaded, and for the more serious, the relationship between Dom, Mia, Vince, Letty, and the others is amazing.If you haven't seen this movie, rent it tonight\n",

They both produced ordinary performances from the cast of alleged actors. They also both contained action scenes that were so ridiculous you could only smile at the the disgraceful way money is handed out to pretenders, sorry producers to make this crap.At least \"Point Break\" mixed the action scenes between sky diving and surfing rather than the mundane street racing over an over. Maybe they could have towed someone on roller skates behind the cars for extra adrenaline.\n",

The world that the characters live in in this film is the world we can only dream of, to race in cool tricked out cars with dozens of beautiful women surrounding you and cheering you on. All of this is what I love most about this film but I also love the cast; Vin Diesal, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster all clinch their roles. If I were to pick my favorite cast member I would have to go with Michelle Rodriguez because not only is she a talented actress she is beautiful and bad ass in everything she's ever been in and this is probably my favorite role of hers. This is a movie were you really don't have to care about the plot because all the eye-candy and fun of this movie is the cars, girls, and action which is enough to pull you into the driver's seat. The cars are fast the action is furious and that's why this movie rocks.\n",

            "Review Text: Rob Cohen's \"The Fast and the Furious\" has no business being as great as it is. A film about fast cars, undercover cops, and highway robbery should provide limited, perhaps dimwitted thrills, but Cohen's colorful and swift-paced action outing provides such likable characters, slick stunts, and buoyant spirit that the whole affair elevates itself to the highest levels of lively, well-assembled fun. It is a surprisingly robust and satisfying experience.The film follows an undercover police officer working to infiltrate the world of street racing to bust a low-level crime syndicate. While undercover, he develops an affinity toward the racers and inconvenient brotherhood is established. Between the cars, busts, and friendships, a token crime story becomes a tale of family. It is simply compelling and effortlessly entertaining.Cohen creates a multi-ethnic world of sunshine, turbo charged technology, and well-rendered characters. It is a Los Angeles of beautiful paint jobs, palm trees, and lived-in locations. Color, verve, and speed burst forth from Cohen's frames in layered and lively compositions. Editing, design, and music create an always- pulsing energy that permeates every sequence.Though the film is about racing and the thrills that drive the sport, Cohen cast actors that earn as much attention as the horse- powered rockets. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Chad Lindberg, and Michelle Rodriguez form the family unit the inspires the film's themes and emotions. Each actor builds a solid character, with the leads being especially memorable. Diesel glowers and Walker exudes a naive charm. They form a charismatic duo.A slick and undeniably entertaining action gem, \"The Fast and the Furious\" soars with its combination of character and thrills. Set pieces are exciting, character beats are affecting, and the stunts are electrifying. It is a remarkable, sweat, oil, and sun-soaked piece of work.\n",

            "Review Text: Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) wants to join the family of the head of California street racing (Vin Diesel)...but why?The plot is comic book level; the dialogue is very VERY bad...but who really cares?  This is a throwback of those dumb 1970s drive-in movies...it's for people who like loud, fast films filled with mindless action, attractive women, cars...and nothing else.  I didn't like the film.  It was too loud, too silly and way too long for a dumb action flick.  What saves it is some truly incredible action sequences (the \"hijacking\" sequence towards the end was unbelievable), some very nice, innovative direction, a cast that manages to be good despite the script and a very good performance by Vin Diesel. This was supposed to be Walker's breakthrough film but Diesel steals it away.  Also it looks kind of silly to have tall, lean, pretty boy Walker against tall, muscular, severe-looking Diesel.See it for the action and Diesel.  During the slow spots admire the cars or the women.\n",

            "Review Text: This is a great movie. Far from being superficial pulp, this movie has a complex plot. Vin Diesel's performance is tremendous; his screen presence is dominating. He succeeds in carrying the movie. Although the movie contains lots of glitz, it also tells a story that deals with themes such as loyalty and betrayal. The rest of the cast is excellent too, especially Jordana Brewster and Paul Walker. Michelle Rodriguez is as usual wonderful. It would be easy to dismiss this movie as being little more than a live action cartoon, but the movie really is full of surprises. It has several intensely dramatic scenes, some of the most incredible car chase scenes, and some deeply esoteric verbal exchanges fraught with emotion. Whether it's Vin Diesel pouting or Paul Walker being heroic, the results are same: nonstop action, intense dialog, and interesting characters, all of which together produce great entertainment. It's more than just about automobiles.\n",

            "Review Text: The Fast and the Furious is a car culture movie that created an action cinematic universe. So many meme lines and amazing car action are packed into this pre-9/11, Y2K time capsule. It's always fun to see where the Fast Franchise began and the birth of series staples, back when Dom still appeared mortal.Point Break with cars is NOS when you infuse it with an Attitude Era type of style. Even its ridiculous moments have appeal as many of them are now meme royalty. It's like tuna on white bread with no crust; some might think it's crappy, but others will keep coming back for it.

I was totally happy with the results of this film. This film had some of the best car chase/racing sequences I've ever seen. I loved the chase scenes in \"Bullit\",\"French Connection\" and my favorite of all time, \"Ronin\". \"Fast and the Furious\" matches up pretty well with those great car sequences. If you like cars at all, you should think about seeing \"The Fast and the Furious\". It's just a fun summer film. Peace\n",

            "[<div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">What made the first \"The Fast and the Furious\" movie attracted fans besides the bad ass cars and competition on the streets was Vin Diesel's appearance as Dominic Toretta, a hotshot race driver who makes his money racing others in the streets; he was a rising star on the fame after doing such flicks such as \"Saving Private Ryan\", \"The Iron Giant\" and later doing \"XXX\".<br/><br/>At the end of the first movie, Vin's character Dominic flees away to Mexico where he wouldn't be in this sequel.<br/><br/>No matter, the series continues on.<br/><br/>\"2 Fast 2 Furious\" has Paul Walker reprising his role as Brian O'Conner, the one time agent who betrayed the enforcement agency by letting Dominic get away, is now a fugitive and being in a race competitions every night to make money. After being captured by the police, Brian is given a choice in either going to jail or helped the people he once work for in taking down a drug cartel dealer (Cole Hauser). Brian agrees under one condition that he gets his childhood friend Roman Pierce (Tyrese Gibson, Transformers) involved since he's into cars and knows his ways around tough people. They're also given an ally, the sexy Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) who's not only an undercover agent but also posing as the enemy's mistress. Time will tell when all will be revealed.<br/><br/>\"2 Fast 2 Furious\" is directed by John Singleton of Boyz in the Hood fame where he manages to bring the same energy and high expectations of the first movie. There's more cars, more chase sequences, more babes and more cameos this time around with a high octane pace.<br/><br/>Overall, it's good.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">With the help of Paul Walker and Vin Diesel's chemistry and some intense racing scenes, Rob Cohen's The Fast and the Furious (2001) was an instant hit among racing fans. And like most franchises with critical financial success, a sequel started to be put into the works. Similar to many other sequels, it was distributed two years later and it's difficult to say whether it pleased fans as much as the first one did. According to this site, this is lowest score the franchise has. It wasn't bad at all but it was missing a few elements of the first movie, which left a more entertaining feeling.<br/><br/>The story follows ex-cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) back to Miami from Los Angeles where he's enjoying his time racing street cars only to be pulled back by the authorities that he dropped. Heading the authorities is Agent Bilkins (Thom Barry) from the first installment and this time he wants O'Conner back one more time to take down a drug lord. And O'Conner can't refuse because he'd go to jail if he didn't accept. Plus, if the drug lord is turned in, all of his criminal charges will disappear. Why does this plot sound like Vin Diesel's xXx (2002) plot line (except it doesn't deal with a drug lord)? Speaking of which, why didn't Vin Diesel return? That's one thing that this franchise consistently needs. Paul Walker is the central character but Vin Diesel's presence was the icing on the cake.<br/><br/>Is was nice though that the writers kept the continuity together. The characters do reference material from the first film which shows the producers want to keep the story going and not divert completely from the original. But if there's one thing that comes into question, it is the concept of getting caught having a love interest in the business. This happened in the first movie and it blew O'Conners cover. Here the same thing happens in a similar way. You'd think the lesson was learned. Sigh. The new interest is Eva Mendes and she plays her character well enough. Accompanying O'Conner is Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) an old friend who originally has a grudge for some of his own issues. Even with this though, their chemistry works well.<br/><br/>Playing the drug lord is another interesting actor - Cole Hauser. He has a very smooth deep voice and resembles a very young Tom Berenger. He's also able to make his character seem dangerous enough to hurt someone. That's it for characters. The music produced by David Arnold of Stargate (1994) sounded better than BT's score from the first film but it wasn't evident enough. Barely heard a thing. As for action scenes, the racing is still fast paced and contains much of the same film making as the first, which kept the feeling the same. Other than that, the story feels the same as before but without Vin Diesel. <br/><br/>It's not a bad follow up to the first movie, but not casting Vin Diesel wasn't smart - it's like missing a piece to a puzzle. Other than that, it's still a decent watch with better music and well-staged action sequences.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">This film brings back more of what we loved from the first film with all the cars, girls, and action and multiplies it. However it is still inferior to the first film but that dosen't mean it isn't awesome. This movie has gotten a lot of criticism and i don't understand why there is so much hate for this movie. Some people complained about the lack of plot and the casts acting skills but I don't care about that. I watch these Fast films to be entertained and I was throughly entertained with this one. Even though it dosen't match up to the original it still excels in excitement. I mean how could you go wrong with taking the series to Miami were our eyes will be blessed with dozens of beautiful beach girls. And the races in this movie are also very exciting to. And let's not forget the awesome chase sequence in the film as well. Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson make a great team and show us why this movie is so cool. I still love this movie despite the many negative reviews I've seen and to all the haters I say forget about the plot and just enjoy the perks. This movie is made for entertainment not Oscar awards and as far as entertainment goes It was grade A popcorn style.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Undoubtedly this sequel suffers from the absence of Dom and the Toretto clan, but it still makes for a very enjoyable ride.<br/><br/>The plot is a little bit derivative of the first, following Brian on an undercover op, but it is a pretty fun story nonetheless.<br/><br/>We get to meet new characters Tej and Roman, who grow to become franchise regulars, and their introductions are very solid.<br/><br/>The direction is fairly slick. Some of the awkward choppy camera shots and whiplash inducing cuts remain, but there's plenty of impressive camera work in here too.<br/><br/>What I really enjoyed about this film though was the general tone. It is energetic and sleek and despite its flaws always carries a certain amount of charm and appeal.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">The cars, the stunts and the eye candy (Eva Mendes) are better than the first. But unlike the first, 2 Fast 2 Furious still boasts a lacklustre plot. Nevertheless, it's a great \"bro\" movie for the guys. The partnership between Roman Pierce (Tyrese Gibson) and Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is amusing and works well as they team up and do next to impossible driving stunts with each other. The slight romance between Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) and Brian O'Connor is predictable, but it's not to the same extent as the first one - just a bit of flirtation but not to the extent of a full fledged relationship. The Miami backdrop adds to the \"upgrade\" feel of the second movie in the Fast &amp; Furious franchise. Flashy and full of action is 2 Fast, 2 Furious.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">2 Fast 2 Furious: 5/10: Okay so it's car porn. It's rather well done car porn. Stunningly brainless but rather fun in places 2 Fast 2 Furious gives us a candy colored version of street racing with a plot that is best not even discussed. <br/><br/>After all you don't watch this for the plot. You watch it for the cars. A giant product placement for Mitsubishi among others the cars and characters are right out of a video game (the paint jobs match the personalities) and kudos to the filmmakers for keeping the CGI to a minimum. The movie made me want to trick out my old Dodge Dart.(Electric Blue paint job with matching neon on yeah baby). <br/><br/>Director John Singletary moves the cars around like he has been directing Burt Reynolds's movies all his life. (This is not a criticism and the fact he avoids Cannonball Run style humor is another plus.) Singletary who usually films much more important movies, (what's next Scorsese's Jaws 5 or Spike Lee's Ella Enchanted 2 Ella in Da Hood? Actually the way some of Spike's recent films have gone this may not be a bad idea) keeps the pace tight and the actors attractive.<br/><br/>However all is not peachy keen. For example I haven't seen African American hairstyles this bad since Cotton came to Harlem. The Tyrese character comes across as a complete idiot almost sinking the movie once or twice. (Now I know Tyrese can act I saw Baby Boy.) Another quick note I have driven cars with nitrous oxide and they give you a burst of acceleration not warp speed effects from Star Trek. (And lets face it the Mitishibishi cars are pretty but not fast. These cars are dragging down a strip after a minute and the speedometer finally moves from 90 to 120 my Dart has better acceleration after 60 sixty seconds.<br/><br/>The movie, to its credit, acknowledges when the cars get whooped by some old American muscle. I know I promised not to discuss the plot but one thing. If you needed someone to drive a couple of million dollars from Miami to Key West (all of 2 hours on Interstate 95 and Route 1), would you A: hire and old couple in a RV B: Drive it yourself or C: Hire two ex-cons in the flashiest cars you have ever seen and who had to this point been incapable of rounding the block without causing an accident and attracting various state and local agencies. I guess that's why we are not criminal masterminds.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">2 Fast 2 Furious lives up to its title and delivers some very cool scenes. Brian O'Connor {Paul Walker}, now a disgraced cop, fell victim to it--and now he's paying the price. As far as his bosses and the FBI brass are concerned, the hothead undercover officer threw one of their largest investigations ever. After losing his badge and any chance of redemption along with it, O'Connor is given one last chance when the feds in Miami need his help to collar Carter Verone, a flashy businessman whose using his import/export business as a cover for an international money laundering cartel. Brian isn't alone though as he has his old friend Roman Pearce {Tyrese} and undercover agent Monica Fuentes{ Eva Mendes} to help him out. The plot may sound bad and if you can't look past it then this isn't the film for you. This film is only worth watching if there are exciting action scenes. For the most part, the film doesn't disappoint in that category but the rest of the film isn't very strong. The acting is bad, worse then the original even. Paul Walker doesn't have enough charisma to be a lead and he also doesn't have much talent. Eva Mendes does an okay job and she is probably the best actress in this film. Tyrese should stick to modeling as his acting is very poor. Ludicrous may have top billing but he isn't in the film very much. Cole Hauser does an average job of playing a bad guy. He isn't about to set the world on fire but his performance isn't terrible either. John Singleton directs and does a better job then Rob Cohen did yet the film is still lacking in a good story. 2 Fast 2 Furious is a sequel in the loosest definition of the word. Only one star returns, there's a new director, actors, producers etc. It doesn't really matter though as the cars are the real stars. The cars in this film are pretty cool and look really nice. This film is of course very unrealistic as some of the stunts break the laws of gravity. The running time is 107 minutes though sometimes the film seems longer. A lot of people were complaining that Vin wasn't in this one. I'm kind of glad though as he wasn't that impressive in the original. Is this one better then the original? I liked it more as it wasn't as boring as the original. In the end, this film has plenty of action to deliver but not much in the story or the acting which brings it down. Rating 6/10, above average action flick.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">So much greatness in this film I'm shocked it's got a 5.9 rating! John Singleton directed such a wild ride of fun entertainment with the cars, music, neon lights, cinematography, popcorn lines that are loved and engaging story. The characters have the perfect energy; I get such a jolly vibe from 2 Fast 2 Furious every time I see it!</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">It's not as good as the first and repeats the first film's plot but 2 Fast 2 Furious is still fun due to great performances from Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson and their great chemistry. The enjoyable and over the top action helps as well.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)<br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>Sequel to THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS has former cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) pulled back into the game when he's asked to go undercover and link a drug dealer to some flowing cash. O'Conner brings in his buddy Roman (Tyrese Gibson) as the two try to bring down the drug dealer so that their records will be cleared. I think it's safe to say that John Singleton is pretty much above this type of material and I think his inexperience in the genre somewhat hurts the picture. There's no question that the man knows how to tell a story and I think he does a great job with just about everything in the picture except for the car races and stunts. The one area where this sequel is really lacking is in regards to the races because they all look rather poor. A lot of this can be blamed on how they're shot and I also wasn't too impressed with the editing during these scenes. It really did seem as if they didn't film anything in a good way so they had to cover it up with the editing. Another bad thing is when the cars hit their \"turbo\" we're given some very bad effects with all the scenery getting blurry. This here just doesn't work. The rest of the film I thought was pretty good as we're given characters we like and there's no question that there's plenty of eye candy at work. Walker and Gibson are both good in their parts as they share some nice chemistry and both manage to play it cool. Eva Mendes doesn't get too much to do except try out a good looking bikini, which I'm sure will be enough for most. The rest of the supporting players are good in their parts including Cole Hauser as the bad guy as Ludicrous as a racing buddy. At just 108-minutes the film never overstays its welcome and director Singleton at least keeps the film moving at a nice pace. The story itself is downright idiotic but this is a popcorn movie after all so it's not that big of a deal.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">The writers and producers of the braindead and equally boring hit The Fast and The Furious decided to put another mindless piece of junk in this world. As, it turned out, it's quite an improvement over part 1.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel rightfully picked other projects to work on so we have to do with Paul Walker playing his 'am I a cop or aren't I' routine (I still don't know whether he is or not), and this time around his play mate is 'Roman Pearce', played by a dude called Tyrese, who decided NOT to use a last name. Oh well.<br/><br/>To brighten things up they brought in Eva Mendes, whose characterization of 'Monica Fuentes' should have deserved her a razzie. My eyes, my eyes! (in a bad way, that is). Then there's Devon Aoki, who is completing the multi-cultural (to keep everybody happy?) line-up as 'Suki'.<br/><br/>The story is some blabla about a drug baron who keeps his money in a trailer (!), which has to picked up by our heroes he only met (!), so he can fly or sail away while having a shotgun at handy(!). Talk about your low profile Godfather of crime.<br/><br/>It all serves to let the attractive cast and luscious extra's have their go on some speedy cars apparently. It's a cross between a rap video and the incredibly intelligent MTV show 'Pimp My Ride'. With obviously some white and hispanic guys for marketing reasons.<br/><br/>The great thing about this movie is they got each car their own colour so to make sure we don't mix them up... this is for all you comatose kids out there I guess...<br/><br/>Back to the story: after a slow first 30 minutes or so things speed up and although the finale was kinda lacking, well, in everything really it was an OK ride (yes, all puns in this part are indeed intended).<br/><br/>Not as bad as part 1, but not nearly as good as, you know, a decent movie. 4/10.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">I must not know movies at all, I have loved this movie since I was a kid and I watch it often. I'm kind of shocked this movie is rated at a 5.9 but I suppose people really know how to analyze films. Maybe just sit back relax and enjoy the ride of this movie and see what you think for yourself. I always look at movie ratings on IMDB before I watch and if it is less than a 6 I usually keep looking for something to watch. May have to rethink that one now one of my favorites is only at 5.9/10.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">I watched this because my friend offered to pay for me, and we had some time to burn. So off i went skulking about the fact i would have to sit a watch a plotless film about cars (ooooooww! The excitment is too much).<br/><br/>I really really wished my friend had lost his wallet and could not have afforded the tickets, as this has to be possibly one of the worst films to grace the big screen. I have heared rumours that computer programmes have been created that write scripts. After watching this film i actually believe this. I seen porn films with better dialogue.<br/><br/>The car chases were average at best. I honestly cannot be bothered to sit and abuse this film further. So i will simply end by saying this; if you have a brain, avoid this film.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">2 Fast 2 Furious is the second film in the long running car-based action series (if you look very carefully, you'll see that the number '2' replaces the word 'Too' in the title! Clever that!). It's essentially the same cocktail of hot motors, hot girls, hot guys and hot locations as before, but with no Vin Diesel, his character having driven over the horizon at the end of the first film (only to return later in the series, once the actor had lowered his asking price).<br/><br/>Instead, star Paul Walker—reprising his role as cop turned street-racer Brian O'Connor—is teamed up with Tyrese Gibson, who plays Roman Pearce, a criminal given the chance to wipe his record clean if he helps the FBI bust crime boss Carter Verone (Cole Hauser). With help from lovely Latino undercover agent Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) and their super cool street-racer homies (who include rapper Ludicrous as garage owner Tej and model Devon Aoki as sexy driver Suki), Brian and Roman successfully outmanoeuvre the bad guys (and the feds) at every turn.<br/><br/>Director John Singleton does a pretty good job handling the action, utilising all sorts of whizzy camera trickery and CGI effects to allow the camera to sweep from one driver to another during the high-speed racing scenes; it's technically impressive stuff that makes up somewhat for the extremely predictable plot and clichéd characters. Some of the stunts are extremely silly—a jump over a raised bridge that sees Walker leap his vehicle over his opponent's car takes the biscuit—but for a film that is all about excess, it all seems very apt and does little to spoil one's enjoyment.<br/><br/>6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) is highly underrated Entertained solid decent action flick for a sequel. I am a Paul Walker Fan and I just love him and his character Brian O'Conner former L.A. Police Officer. So I don't care what anyone says because absence without Vin Diesel was terrible. Well is not! Paul Walker plays all alone so he is awesome star. Leave this film alone it is pretty good and in my opinion is pretty much better than The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) and Furious Seven (2015). You have Tyrese Gibson, Chris Bridges, James Remar, Cole Hauser, Eva Mendes and Thom Barry as Agent Bilkins who reprise his role from the first installment in here. I love this film not as much as I love Fast &amp; Furious 6 (2013), Fast Five (2011), The Fast &amp; The Furious (2001) and Fast &amp; Furious (2009). John Singleton did an excellent job directing this action packed sequel flick.<br/><br/>\"All right, let's see what this thing can do.\" <br/><br/>'The adrenaline-fueled thrill ride that began with The Fast and the Furious takes an explosive new turn in 2 Fast 2 Furious! It's the nitro-fueled answer to the question: how fast do you like it? Now an ex-cop on the run, Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) hooks into outlaw street-racing. When the Feds strong-arm him back, O'Connor's no rules, win-or-die skills are unleashed against an international drug lord. With his velocity-addicted buddy (Tyrese Gibson) riding shotgun, and a drop-dead-gorgeous undercover agent (Eva Mendes) dialing up the heat, 2 Fast 2 Furious accelerates the action into a desperate race for survival, justice... and mind-blowing, jaw-dropping speed!'<br/><br/>I love this movie and the racing damn good and i like Chris Bridges because he isn't like Ice Cube or others rappers that are actors talking like yo whats up dogg. Ludicrous talks proper English. I thought that the movie was incredible! The street racing scenes were very realistic and Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson are a perfect pair for the movie. 5 stars out of 5!! Tokyo Drift was not as good as 2 fast 2 furious, but still good. People: It's not that bad. In fact, it's really good. Is not a bad film it is actually a good film. I still can't believe why people criticized and bash this film so much. Gosh it is the last film in the series I like and I think is better than Tokyo Drift or Furious 7. <br/><br/>Former cop Brian O'Conner is called upon to bust a dangerous criminal and he recruits the help of a former Miami street racer who has a chance to redeem himself. <br/><br/>This film is set in Miami not in L.A. and Devon Aoki did a wonderful job as beautiful and sexy street racer Suki! Eva Mendes was gorgeous and sexy as Agent Monica Fuentes, she was so good at acting that even viewer is guessing if Monica is compromised and a dirty agent. Call it what you want I love this film and I think is the last good film of the franchise!<br/><br/>Former Cop Brian O'Conner who teams up with his ex-con pal Roman Pearce to transport a shipment of 'dirty' money for shady Miami-based import-export dealer Carter Verone while actually working with undercover agent Monica Fuentes to bring Verone down. Brian O'Conner has left L.A. due to illegal actions from the first movie and now soars the streets of Miami taking money here and there by street racing. Watched by Customs Agent Monica Fuentes , Brian is caught by the police and is given a deal by agent Markham and Bilkins to go undercover and try to bring down drug lord Carter Verone in exchange for his criminal record to be erased. Brian agrees if he is given permission to choose his partner. Brian heads home to Barstow, California where he recruits an old friend Roman Pearce to help him. Pearce agrees but only for the same deal Brian was offered. With help Monica, Brian and Rome work together to take down Verone. <br/><br/>This film was never about cars but it was about taking a crime lord down who is actually smuggling dirty laundry money with fast cars. Here we finally get to met Roman Pearce for the first time. We get to know more about Brian's background. We finally get to know why Brian let go Dom (Vin Diesel) in the first film. The Action sequences and fast cars are also great, so I don't know what is the problem at all?! <br/><br/>2 Fast 2 Furious is a 2003 American action film directed by John Singleton. It is the second installment of The Fast and the Furious franchise. Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) teams up with his ex-con friend Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) and works with undercover U.S. Customs Service agent Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) to bring Miami-based drug lord Carter Verone (Cole Hauser) down.<br/><br/>The rating I am giving to this film is 7. Anything below 7 would be ridiculous, if anyone would not say that this wasn't At least A GOOD ACTION FILM! (it is sure as hell better than all the comic movies that are getting high scores.)<br/><br/>7/10 Score: B Studio: Universal Pictures Starring: Paul Walker, Tyrese Gibson, Eva Mendes, Cole Hauser, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, James Remar Director: John Singleton Producer: Neal H. Moritz Screenplay: Michael Brandt, Derek Haas Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 1 Hr. 47 Mins. Budget: $76.000.000Box Office: $127,154,901</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">I much preferred this one to the \"original\".  The first movie was basically Point Break in cars !! At least this one is stealing story lines from a few movies - bond, XXX, etc. Paul Walker really needs to quit his attempts at a moustache in these movies, it really just looks daft.  He looks like someone desperately trying to get facial hair and failing miserably. That said - he does a much better job in this movie than the first. Do not go to this film expecting it to be deep and meaningful, but just for fun.  Excellent cars - especially liked the scene where the car switch was pulled... Good movie as long as you're not expecting much!</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">I commited the mistake of watching this movie while at a cousin's home. I want my time back!!!. This movie is awful, you can guess all just by watching the cover, the whole thing is just a mitsubishi commercial, there's an interview where one of the guys \"fixing\" the cars was told he could get any cars he wanted, and he chose mitsubishi... yeah, right!, no one would chose a Porsche instead, huh?. Apart from that the movie is totally boring, the car race scenes are unoriginal, predictable, and not even fun to watch. I guess the only way you could like this flick is if you have a thing for tuning cars, otherwise run from this like the plague. I bet in a very short time you'll be able to get your copy of this movie free from your local mitsubishi dealer!</div>]\n"

            "Review Text: What made the first \"The Fast and the Furious\" movie attracted fans besides the bad ass cars and competition on the streets was Vin Diesel's appearance as Dominic Toretta, a hotshot race driver who makes his money racing others in the streets; he was a rising star on the fame after doing such flicks such as \"Saving Private Ryan\", \"The Iron Giant\" and later doing \"XXX\".At the end of the first movie, Vin's character Dominic flees away to Mexico where he wouldn't be in this sequel.No matter, the series continues on.\"2 Fast 2 Furious\" has Paul Walker reprising his role as Brian O'Conner, the one time agent who betrayed the enforcement agency by letting Dominic get away, is now a fugitive and being in a race competitions every night to make money. After being captured by the police, Brian is given a choice in either going to jail or helped the people he once work for in taking down a drug cartel dealer (Cole Hauser). Brian agrees under one condition that he gets his childhood friend Roman Pierce (Tyrese Gibson, Transformers) involved since he's into cars and knows his ways around tough people. They're also given an ally, the sexy Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) who's not only an undercover agent but also posing as the enemy's mistress. Time will tell when all will be revealed.\"2 Fast 2 Furious\" is directed by John Singleton of Boyz in the Hood fame where he manages to bring the same energy and high expectations of the first movie. There's more cars, more chase sequences, more babes and more cameos this time around with a high octane pace.Overall, it's good.\n",

            "Review Text: With the help of Paul Walker and Vin Diesel's chemistry and some intense racing scenes, Rob Cohen's The Fast and the Furious (2001) was an instant hit among racing fans. And like most franchises with critical financial success, a sequel started to be put into the works. Similar to many other sequels, it was distributed two years later and it's difficult to say whether it pleased fans as much as the first one did. According to this site, this is lowest score the franchise has. It wasn't bad at all but it was missing a few elements of the first movie, which left a more entertaining feeling.The story follows ex-cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) back to Miami from Los Angeles where he's enjoying his time racing street cars only to be pulled back by the authorities that he dropped. Heading the authorities is Agent Bilkins (Thom Barry) from the first installment and this time he wants O'Conner back one more time to take down a drug lord. And O'Conner can't refuse because he'd go to jail if he didn't accept. Plus, if the drug lord is turned in, all of his criminal charges will disappear. Why does this plot sound like Vin Diesel's xXx (2002) plot line (except it doesn't deal with a drug lord)? Speaking of which, why didn't Vin Diesel return? That's one thing that this franchise consistently needs. Paul Walker is the central character but Vin Diesel's presence was the icing on the cake.Is was nice though that the writers kept the continuity together. The characters do reference material from the first film which shows the producers want to keep the story going and not divert completely from the original. But if there's one thing that comes into question, it is the concept of getting caught having a love interest in the business. This happened in the first movie and it blew O'Conners cover. Here the same thing happens in a similar way. You'd think the lesson was learned. Sigh. The new interest is Eva Mendes and she plays her character well enough. Accompanying O'Conner is Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) an old friend who originally has a grudge for some of his own issues. Even with this though, their chemistry works well.Playing the drug lord is another interesting actor - Cole Hauser. He has a very smooth deep voice and resembles a very young Tom Berenger. He's also able to make his character seem dangerous enough to hurt someone. That's it for characters. The music produced by David Arnold of Stargate (1994) sounded better than BT's score from the first film but it wasn't evident enough. Barely heard a thing. As for action scenes, the racing is still fast paced and contains much of the same film making as the first, which kept the feeling the same. Other than that, the story feels the same as before but without Vin Diesel. It's not a bad follow up to the first movie, but not casting Vin Diesel wasn't smart - it's like missing a piece to a puzzle. Other than that, it's still a decent watch with better music and well-staged action sequences.\n",

            "Review Text: This film brings back more of what we loved from the first film with all the cars, girls, and action and multiplies it. However it is still inferior to the first film but that dosen't mean it isn't awesome. This movie has gotten a lot of criticism and i don't understand why there is so much hate for this movie. Some people complained about the lack of plot and the casts acting skills but I don't care about that. I watch these Fast films to be entertained and I was throughly entertained with this one. Even though it dosen't match up to the original it still excels in excitement. I mean how could you go wrong with taking the series to Miami were our eyes will be blessed with dozens of beautiful beach girls. And the races in this movie are also very exciting to. And let's not forget the awesome chase sequence in the film as well. Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson make a great team and show us why this movie is so cool. I still love this movie despite the many negative reviews I've seen and to all the haters I say forget about the plot and just enjoy the perks. This movie is made for entertainment not Oscar awards and as far as entertainment goes It was grade A popcorn style.\n",

            "Review Text: Undoubtedly this sequel suffers from the absence of Dom and the Toretto clan, but it still makes for a very enjoyable ride.The plot is a little bit derivative of the first, following Brian on an undercover op, but it is a pretty fun story nonetheless.We get to meet new characters Tej and Roman, who grow to become franchise regulars, and their introductions are very solid.The direction is fairly slick. Some of the awkward choppy camera shots and whiplash inducing cuts remain, but there's plenty of impressive camera work in here too.What I really enjoyed about this film though was the general tone. It is energetic and sleek and despite its flaws always carries a certain amount of charm and appeal.\n",

            "Review Text: The cars, the stunts and the eye candy (Eva Mendes) are better than the first. But unlike the first, 2 Fast 2 Furious still boasts a lacklustre plot. Nevertheless, it's a great \"bro\" movie for the guys. The partnership between Roman Pierce (Tyrese Gibson) and Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is amusing and works well as they team up and do next to impossible driving stunts with each other. The slight romance between Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) and Brian O'Connor is predictable, but it's not to the same extent as the first one - just a bit of flirtation but not to the extent of a full fledged relationship. The Miami backdrop adds to the \"upgrade\" feel of the second movie in the Fast & Furious franchise. Flashy and full of action is 2 Fast, 2 Furious.\n",

            "Review Text: 2 Fast 2 Furious: 5/10: Okay so it's car porn. It's rather well done car porn. Stunningly brainless but rather fun in places 2 Fast 2 Furious gives us a candy colored version of street racing with a plot that is best not even discussed. After all you don't watch this for the plot. You watch it for the cars. A giant product placement for Mitsubishi among others the cars and characters are right out of a video game (the paint jobs match the personalities) and kudos to the filmmakers for keeping the CGI to a minimum. The movie made me want to trick out my old Dodge Dart.(Electric Blue paint job with matching neon on yeah baby). Director John Singletary moves the cars around like he has been directing Burt Reynolds's movies all his life. (This is not a criticism and the fact he avoids Cannonball Run style humor is another plus.) Singletary who usually films much more important movies, (what's next Scorsese's Jaws 5 or Spike Lee's Ella Enchanted 2 Ella in Da Hood? Actually the way some of Spike's recent films have gone this may not be a bad idea) keeps the pace tight and the actors attractive.However all is not peachy keen. For example I haven't seen African American hairstyles this bad since Cotton came to Harlem. The Tyrese character comes across as a complete idiot almost sinking the movie once or twice. (Now I know Tyrese can act I saw Baby Boy.) Another quick note I have driven cars with nitrous oxide and they give you a burst of acceleration not warp speed effects from Star Trek. (And lets face it the Mitishibishi cars are pretty but not fast. These cars are dragging down a strip after a minute and the speedometer finally moves from 90 to 120 my Dart has better acceleration after 60 sixty seconds.The movie, to its credit, acknowledges when the cars get whooped by some old American muscle. I know I promised not to discuss the plot but one thing. If you needed someone to drive a couple of million dollars from Miami to Key West (all of 2 hours on Interstate 95 and Route 1), would you A: hire and old couple in a RV B: Drive it yourself or C: Hire two ex-cons in the flashiest cars you have ever seen and who had to this point been incapable of rounding the block without causing an accident and attracting various state and local agencies. I guess that's why we are not criminal masterminds.\n",

            "Review Text: 2 Fast 2 Furious lives up to its title and delivers some very cool scenes. Brian O'Connor {Paul Walker}, now a disgraced cop, fell victim to it--and now he's paying the price. As far as his bosses and the FBI brass are concerned, the hothead undercover officer threw one of their largest investigations ever. After losing his badge and any chance of redemption along with it, O'Connor is given one last chance when the feds in Miami need his help to collar Carter Verone, a flashy businessman whose using his import/export business as a cover for an international money laundering cartel. Brian isn't alone though as he has his old friend Roman Pearce {Tyrese} and undercover agent Monica Fuentes{ Eva Mendes} to help him out. The plot may sound bad and if you can't look past it then this isn't the film for you. This film is only worth watching if there are exciting action scenes. For the most part, the film doesn't disappoint in that category but the rest of the film isn't very strong. The acting is bad, worse then the original even. Paul Walker doesn't have enough charisma to be a lead and he also doesn't have much talent. Eva Mendes does an okay job and she is probably the best actress in this film. Tyrese should stick to modeling as his acting is very poor. Ludicrous may have top billing but he isn't in the film very much. Cole Hauser does an average job of playing a bad guy. He isn't about to set the world on fire but his performance isn't terrible either. John Singleton directs and does a better job then Rob Cohen did yet the film is still lacking in a good story. 2 Fast 2 Furious is a sequel in the loosest definition of the word. Only one star returns, there's a new director, actors, producers etc. It doesn't really matter though as the cars are the real stars. The cars in this film are pretty cool and look really nice. This film is of course very unrealistic as some of the stunts break the laws of gravity. The running time is 107 minutes though sometimes the film seems longer. A lot of people were complaining that Vin wasn't in this one. I'm kind of glad though as he wasn't that impressive in the original. Is this one better then the original? I liked it more as it wasn't as boring as the original. In the end, this film has plenty of action to deliver but not much in the story or the acting which brings it down. Rating 6/10, above average action flick.\n",

            "Review Text: 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)** 1/2 (out of 4)Sequel to THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS has former cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) pulled back into the game when he's asked to go undercover and link a drug dealer to some flowing cash. O'Conner brings in his buddy Roman (Tyrese Gibson) as the two try to bring down the drug dealer so that their records will be cleared. I think it's safe to say that John Singleton is pretty much above this type of material and I think his inexperience in the genre somewhat hurts the picture. There's no question that the man knows how to tell a story and I think he does a great job with just about everything in the picture except for the car races and stunts. The one area where this sequel is really lacking is in regards to the races because they all look rather poor. A lot of this can be blamed on how they're shot and I also wasn't too impressed with the editing during these scenes. It really did seem as if they didn't film anything in a good way so they had to cover it up with the editing. Another bad thing is when the cars hit their \"turbo\" we're given some very bad effects with all the scenery getting blurry. This here just doesn't work. The rest of the film I thought was pretty good as we're given characters we like and there's no question that there's plenty of eye candy at work. Walker and Gibson are both good in their parts as they share some nice chemistry and both manage to play it cool. Eva Mendes doesn't get too much to do except try out a good looking bikini, which I'm sure will be enough for most. The rest of the supporting players are good in their parts including Cole Hauser as the bad guy as Ludicrous as a racing buddy. At just 108-minutes the film never overstays its welcome and director Singleton at least keeps the film moving at a nice pace. The story itself is downright idiotic but this is a popcorn movie after all so it's not that big of a deal.\n",

            "Review Text: The writers and producers of the braindead and equally boring hit The Fast and The Furious decided to put another mindless piece of junk in this world. As, it turned out, it's quite an improvement over part 1.Vin Diesel rightfully picked other projects to work on so we have to do with Paul Walker playing his 'am I a cop or aren't I' routine (I still don't know whether he is or not), and this time around his play mate is 'Roman Pearce', played by a dude called Tyrese, who decided NOT to use a last name. Oh well.To brighten things up they brought in Eva Mendes, whose characterization of 'Monica Fuentes' should have deserved her a razzie. My eyes, my eyes! (in a bad way, that is). Then there's Devon Aoki, who is completing the multi-cultural (to keep everybody happy?) line-up as 'Suki'.The story is some blabla about a drug baron who keeps his money in a trailer (!), which has to picked up by our heroes he only met (!), so he can fly or sail away while having a shotgun at handy(!). Talk about your low profile Godfather of crime.It all serves to let the attractive cast and luscious extra's have their go on some speedy cars apparently. It's a cross between a rap video and the incredibly intelligent MTV show 'Pimp My Ride'. With obviously some white and hispanic guys for marketing reasons.The great thing about this movie is they got each car their own colour so to make sure we don't mix them up... this is for all you comatose kids out there I guess...Back to the story: after a slow first 30 minutes or so things speed up and although the finale was kinda lacking, well, in everything really it was an OK ride (yes, all puns in this part are indeed intended).Not as bad as part 1, but not nearly as good as, you know, a decent movie. 4/10.\n",

            "Review Text: 2 Fast 2 Furious is the second film in the long running car-based action series (if you look very carefully, you'll see that the number '2' replaces the word 'Too' in the title! Clever that!). It's essentially the same cocktail of hot motors, hot girls, hot guys and hot locations as before, but with no Vin Diesel, his character having driven over the horizon at the end of the first film (only to return later in the series, once the actor had lowered his asking price).Instead, star Paul Walker—reprising his role as cop turned street-racer Brian O'Connor—is teamed up with Tyrese Gibson, who plays Roman Pearce, a criminal given the chance to wipe his record clean if he helps the FBI bust crime boss Carter Verone (Cole Hauser). With help from lovely Latino undercover agent Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) and their super cool street-racer homies (who include rapper Ludicrous as garage owner Tej and model Devon Aoki as sexy driver Suki), Brian and Roman successfully outmanoeuvre the bad guys (and the feds) at every turn.Director John Singleton does a pretty good job handling the action, utilising all sorts of whizzy camera trickery and CGI effects to allow the camera to sweep from one driver to another during the high-speed racing scenes; it's technically impressive stuff that makes up somewhat for the extremely predictable plot and clichéd characters. Some of the stunts are extremely silly—a jump over a raised bridge that sees Walker leap his vehicle over his opponent's car takes the biscuit—but for a film that is all about excess, it all seems very apt and does little to spoil one's enjoyment.6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.\n",

            "Review Text: 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) is highly underrated Entertained solid decent action flick for a sequel. I am a Paul Walker Fan and I just love him and his character Brian O'Conner former L.A. Police Officer. So I don't care what anyone says because absence without Vin Diesel was terrible. Well is not! Paul Walker plays all alone so he is awesome star. Leave this film alone it is pretty good and in my opinion is pretty much better than The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) and Furious Seven (2015). You have Tyrese Gibson, Chris Bridges, James Remar, Cole Hauser, Eva Mendes and Thom Barry as Agent Bilkins who reprise his role from the first installment in here. I love this film not as much as I love Fast & Furious 6 (2013), Fast Five (2011), The Fast & The Furious (2001) and Fast & Furious (2009). John Singleton did an excellent job directing this action packed sequel flick.\"All right, let's see what this thing can do.\" 'The adrenaline-fueled thrill ride that began with The Fast and the Furious takes an explosive new turn in 2 Fast 2 Furious! It's the nitro-fueled answer to the question: how fast do you like it? Now an ex-cop on the run, Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) hooks into outlaw street-racing. When the Feds strong-arm him back, O'Connor's no rules, win-or-die skills are unleashed against an international drug lord. With his velocity-addicted buddy (Tyrese Gibson) riding shotgun, and a drop-dead-gorgeous undercover agent (Eva Mendes) dialing up the heat, 2 Fast 2 Furious accelerates the action into a desperate race for survival, justice... and mind-blowing, jaw-dropping speed!'I love this movie and the racing damn good and i like Chris Bridges because he isn't like Ice Cube or others rappers that are actors talking like yo whats up dogg. Ludicrous talks proper English. I thought that the movie was incredible! The street racing scenes were very realistic and Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson are a perfect pair for the movie. 5 stars out of 5!! Tokyo Drift was not as good as 2 fast 2 furious, but still good. People: It's not that bad. In fact, it's really good. Is not a bad film it is actually a good film. I still can't believe why people criticized and bash this film so much. Gosh it is the last film in the series I like and I think is better than Tokyo Drift or Furious 7. Former cop Brian O'Conner is called upon to bust a dangerous criminal and he recruits the help of a former Miami street racer who has a chance to redeem himself. This film is set in Miami not in L.A. and Devon Aoki did a wonderful job as beautiful and sexy street racer Suki! Eva Mendes was gorgeous and sexy as Agent Monica Fuentes, she was so good at acting that even viewer is guessing if Monica is compromised and a dirty agent. Call it what you want I love this film and I think is the last good film of the franchise!Former Cop Brian O'Conner who teams up with his ex-con pal Roman Pearce to transport a shipment of 'dirty' money for shady Miami-based import-export dealer Carter Verone while actually working with undercover agent Monica Fuentes to bring Verone down. Brian O'Conner has left L.A. due to illegal actions from the first movie and now soars the streets of Miami taking money here and there by street racing. Watched by Customs Agent Monica Fuentes , Brian is caught by the police and is given a deal by agent Markham and Bilkins to go undercover and try to bring down drug lord Carter Verone in exchange for his criminal record to be erased. Brian agrees if he is given permission to choose his partner. Brian heads home to Barstow, California where he recruits an old friend Roman Pearce to help him. Pearce agrees but only for the same deal Brian was offered. With help Monica, Brian and Rome work together to take down Verone. This film was never about cars but it was about taking a crime lord down who is actually smuggling dirty laundry money with fast cars. Here we finally get to met Roman Pearce for the first time. We get to know more about Brian's background. We finally get to know why Brian let go Dom (Vin Diesel) in the first film. The Action sequences and fast cars are also great, so I don't know what is the problem at all?! 2 Fast 2 Furious is a 2003 American action film directed by John Singleton. It is the second installment of The Fast and the Furious franchise. Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) teams up with his ex-con friend Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) and works with undercover U.S. Customs Service agent Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) to bring Miami-based drug lord Carter Verone (Cole Hauser) down.The rating I am giving to this film is 7. Anything below 7 would be ridiculous, if anyone would not say that this wasn't At least A GOOD ACTION FILM! (it is sure as hell better than all the comic movies that are getting high scores.)7/10 Score: B Studio: Universal Pictures Starring: Paul Walker, Tyrese Gibson, Eva Mendes, Cole Hauser, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, James Remar Director: John Singleton Producer: Neal H.

At least this one is stealing story lines from a few movies - bond, XXX, etc. Paul Walker really needs to quit his attempts at a moustache in these movies, it really just looks daft.  He looks like someone desperately trying to get facial hair and failing miserably. That said - he does a much better job in this movie than the first. Do not go to this film expecting it to be deep and meaningful, but just for fun.  Excellent cars - especially liked the scene where the car switch was pulled... Good movie as long as you're not expecting much!\n",

            "Review Text: I thought the first Fast and the Furious was alright, their was actually a plot to it and it was fun to watch.  This piece of junk on the other hand practically stole many things from other movies and was a complete waste of my time. The casting was terrible and the script was a joke.  This utter crap makes the Fast and the Furious look like a masterpiece destined to be a classic.  Everyone should sign a petition so their will not be a 3rd.  The idea of a second movie was alright, the turnout was terrible!  0 out of 5, I want my 2 hours $7.00 back along with a lot more to make up for the nausia, headaces, and suffering this discrace of a film gave me!!! I beg anyone out there not to waste their money or time.\n",

            "[<div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Look behind the woeful accent and this is actually a good movie. The first F&amp;F was about racing, then went all Miami Vice. A final return to the street racing scene had to move away from the original cast as they had lost their 'From the streets' appeal.<br/><br/>Anyway back to this, some sweet cars that aren't the massively expensive hyper cars of later episodes and some trick driving to boot.<br/><br/>A quality film if you manage to watch it a couple of times and don't dwell on the accent.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">The first film was BREAK POINT with cars. The second one was Miami VICE with cars. This is REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE... with more cars. To be honest, I kinda liked this one better than the last two, despite Lucas Black somehow beating Paul Walker as the least charismatic actor in a starring role. What I mainly like is the direction by Justin Lin. The focus on police undercover stories is dropped in favor of the street racing culture and its connections to the mob. Was actually delighted to see Sonny Chiba appear, I must have missed his name during the opening credits. Purely as a movie about car action, I think it succeeds better than the first two. There's a goofy quality to it that kinda helps one go along with things. Best to sum that up is Lucas Black smiling like a dork with blood on his teeth, living for the thrill. That's probably what this film series needed, and less soap opera/undercover drama. Consider me surprised.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">This is an exciting narration of drifting auto racing with exceptionally fine camera work and great car chase sequences and crashes on the metropolitan streets. It deals about a rebel American adolescent named Shawn Boswell(Lucas Black as a determined race-car driver) challenges his contender for a race cars, causing wreak havoc racing 195 mph through streets. To avoid the jail, his mother(Lynda Boyd) sends him Tokyo where is his father(Brian Goodman) as US military. Meanwhile the newcomer Shawn tries to ingratiate with Twinkie(Nathalie Kelley) and the world of racing in Japan, and hoping to join his extended group. In Tokio he discovers the underworld of the Yazuka and competes against Drift kingpin who is niece of mobster chief(Sonny Chiba who does a credible job).<br/><br/>The picture mingles action-packed,drama, exciting pursuits cars, suspense, a little bit of violence and spectacular sequences though won't mean much on little screen TV. Flashy, noisy race-cars set in the Japan by the producers, -the famous Neal Moritz-of first part. Pulse-quickening action but plenty of clichés and lots of dirty driving and heavier on crashes than coherency. All stunts were performed by authentic experts without people damage. Special cameo by Vin Diesel and appearance by Sonny Chiba, a Kung Fu idol of the 70s. Justin Lin's direction(previously made Annapolis and Better Luck tomorrow) is competent though the story eventually run out of gas. Justin Lin is directing the third part with Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster. The movie gives new meaning to the term ¨Tuning¨and ¨Drifting¨. The flick will like to adrenaline lovers and those young people looking for strong emotions. This is the kind of film in which the cars enthusiastic will enjoy immensely, it's a must see for cars fonds.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">What can I say about this movie that many haven't already noted? Well first of all I saw this movie twice, and probably shouldn't have. The cinematography was phenomenal and the racing sequences were jaw dropping. Unfortunately, this movie lacks substance. The storyline was really iffy and probably not likely to happen and the acting was a little shaky.<br/><br/>But thats not the reason why everyone goes to watch this movie. We all go to see the cars and the girls which fortunately delivers. Beautiful cars, beautiful ladies and beautiful scenery and destructive driving is never in short supply in this genre and the scenery of Japan is just breathtaking. All in all, just a movie you'll want to see with the boys.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">FILM: 7.0\n",
            "Rewatching the 2006 film The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, I find myself enjoying it more than most people seem to. So, here's an unpopular opinion: Tokyo Drift ties as my third favourite film in the series. The film ramps up the fun straight away, ditches the cheese of the second instalment, and goes for an original plot.<br/><br/>One of the aspects I appreciate most about Tokyo Drift is its unique setting and storyline. Shifting the focus to Tokyo and introducing the world of drift racing feels fresh and exciting. The races and chases are some of the series' best, with a kinetic energy that keeps me engaged throughout. The soundtrack is another highlight, with its thumping beats perfectly complementing the high-speed action.<br/><br/>I know people heap crap on it for not keeping it in the \"family,\" but it's an undeniably fun ride. The absence of the core characters initially feels strange, but the new cast manages to hold their own. Lucas Black as Sean Boswell brings a different kind of protagonist to the table, and I find his journey from outsider to drift racing aficionado quite compelling.<br/><br/>The character of Han, played by Sung Kang, is a standout. His cool, mentor-like presence adds depth to the film and makes for some memorable moments. The Tokyo setting is visually stunning, and the film makes excellent use of its locations, showcasing the vibrant cityscape in a way that's both thrilling and immersive.<br/><br/>What I like about Tokyo Drift is its ability to balance the adrenaline-pumping action with a story that feels grounded. The film doesn't rely on the over-the-top stunts that the later entries in the series do, and that simpler approach works in its favour.<br/><br/>Overall, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a fairly positive experience that brings something fresh and exciting to the franchise. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, I find it to be a fun and engaging film that stands out in its own right.<br/><br/>FORMAT: Blu-ray<br/><br/>VIDEO: 9.0\n",

Nice music. Nice bodies. Nice cityscape.<br/><br/>Brainless story. But that's what I watched it for, to have my brains parked outside the cinema and let the brainlessness drive me through a two hour entertainment.<br/><br/>The RX7 has more expression than all the actors.<br/><br/>C - Because it served its purpose in entertaining me with awesome drifts, over-sized exhaust pipes, and kick butt photography for a car racing film.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">I was quite surprised by The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift. Of course, I expected it to be a pile of steaming garbage, particularly with the formula of increasingly dodgy sequels. So when I went to see it with some friends, I had obvious misgivings. These misgivings, or at least the worst ones, such as the movie being unbearable to even look at, were fortunately unfounded. I kept my eyes on the movie the whole time, mainly because of the souped cars, but the fact that I went through the movie without flinching (a lot, except at some of the bad dialogue that was prevalent), says quite a lot. Maybe my view of The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift is heightened by the fact that I cracked a few jokes during the movie.<br/><br/>Now down to business. Sean, a 'dude' who loves to race at high speeds for no apparent reason, is sent to Tokyo to live with his military dad and ends up being drawn to the racing circuit again, witnessing a new style of race called 'drift' (as seen in Need For Speed Underground, to those that don't know). Sounds stupid? Well, it is, the casual viewer can detect a plothole or two from even reading those two lines. To go on, except to state that Sean ends up making friends with a guy named Han, is pointless. I will admit that no-one looks for a good plot in a Fast and the Furious movie, but still, the less said, the better.<br/><br/>The dialogue, as I stated, can be funny - because of its stupidity. This is shown by one piece of dialogue where some guy asks Sean: \"You know what DK stands for?\" and Sean replies \"Donkey Kong\". At least its original, I guess.<br/><br/>The acting is OK - far from turgid, which I expected it to be in the first place. The guy who plays Han is surprisingly good, going through the movie without looking as if he was hired from a nearby sushi bar. Brian Tee as DK is a bit of a joke, he is more comedic than menacing. Lucas Black is OK as Sean, but his Southern accent makes his character more irritating to watch. The love interest does well as eye candy. That's about all that matters I guess.<br/><br/>The most important part of The Fast and the Furious is inarguably the racing sequences and their overall effectiveness. I will admit that the sequences themselves are well-filmed and eye catching, highlighting the cars, as they should. However, except in a few fleeting moments, they are not as enthralling as they should be and this is one of the most disappointing aspects of The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift. The final confrontation, for me, is pretty good to watch, but only arouses the senses once in a while.<br/><br/>Time didn't drag though, which is a clear sign that The Fast and Furious is indeed quite watchable, despite its other pre-eminent faults. I admit that I didn't really get bored during the film, which may lead to my rose-tinted view of it (compared to my original perception of what it would be like).<br/><br/>So let me summarise my thoughts: \"Didn't expect much, got more than I bargained for.\" The acting is satisfactory (for a racing film, otherwise it would more or less suck), the plot and the dialogue are predictably terrible, the racing sequences are satisfactory and the cinematography is somewhat effective, with frequent close-ups of the cars. What compels me to give The Fast and The Furious a pass grade is the fact that it is, like I said, quite watchable. However, it is still little more than satisfactory, so it's rating cannot therefore rise above:<br/><br/>2.5/5 stars</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">This is the only movie about cars racing and after this they are only fighting between each other . Why this movie do not earn more at box office i don't understand. But for me this movie is best in franchise after fast five.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">The first movie was good, the second not so much...this one is terrible.\n",
            "The main actor has to be one of the worst I've ever seen, he sounds like Forrest Gump and his 'acting' is like a child at a school play. The cars were good and some of the women nice to look at so if that's what you're here for you'll probably enjoy it.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is an improvement over the previous installment. Lucas Black and Sung Kang give great performances. Justin Lin's direction is great and the new location breathes new life into the franchise with some of the best car chases yet, even if the plot is nothing new.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">I actually really enjoyed this movie. I love the location, cool race scenes, surprisingly interesting plot and overall a lot of fun. If you are a fan of the franchise you might be disappointed cause of its lack of characters we know and love but you'll still be entertained.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">When teenage road-racer Sean Boswell (Lucas Black, who is too old for the part, but hey-ho) gets in trouble with the law for a third time, he avoids a jail sentence by going to live with his father in Tokyo; there, he becomes involved in the drift racing scene, coming to blows with DK (Brian Tee), the nephew of a powerful Yakuza.<br/><br/>Tokyo Drift gets short shrift from some Fast &amp; Furious fans because it steers the franchise away from the US street racing scene and because it doesn't star series regular Paul Walker. While it might be a slight step down from the previous entries, being a little too teen-centric with its predictably troublesome high school protagonist, I don't think it's all that bad. As a fan of all things Japanese, I can appreciate the colourful Tokyo setting, the Yakuza storyline, and, of course, all those oriental cuties in extremely short skirts.<br/><br/>Director Justin Lin, who went on to helm parts 4, 5 and 6 in the series, handles the car scenes with aplomb, each race shifting up a gear in terms of adrenaline-pumping action. Drifting—sliding the car around sharp corners at high speed—adds a new level of excitement to the action, with a mountain road finale offering plenty of nerve jangling, edge-of-the-seat moments. The film closes with the reappearance of a familiar face, paving the way for further instalments.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">The only interesting part of this movie is the drifting. That's all. The cast is fine but the depth of the character is just meh (except for Han who had a good motive). The story and plot lack some tension, especially the Yakuza part. Why the hell Yakuza was described so weak in this movie.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">For everyone who likes action and car films Fast and the Fourious Tokio Drift will be very good for you.\n",
            "The story is well written and the actors are doing their job well.\n",
            "In the film are a lot of car races.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">An incurable addicted-to-speed young racer, Lucas Black, escapes to Tokyo to avoid jail after repeated arrests for racing. He joins his father, (who is estranged from his mother), in Tokyo where he runs into problems with other local race-aholics. The young American vies for the attention of gal who is linked to local Japanese racer, and the two rivals for affection eventually butt heads. This is the extent of plot you get in this tire-screeching, attitude and hormone churning, low-brow flick, where almost every character seems to be suffering from some form of personality disorder, or is just plain stupid. Somehow, in spite of a glaring lack of insight or smarts, the protagonist, a refugee from high school \"shop\" classes where he learned to work on cars, seems to master the Japanese language effortlessly. The Japanese characters in the flick are equally repulsive, or more so, as most are no more than thugs, with our hero's Japanese rival wrapped up in a Yakuza (Mafia) family. The movie is just a \"loser to bruiser\" story, as the young American masters the Japanese racing style, with flashy fast cars providing the backdrop for our hero's transformation. The movie does offer a generous supply of laughs, but I don't think that's what the director and company had intended.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">With great racing scenes, silly action scenes and generic performances, \"The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift\" offers what is more than necessary for fans of this franchise and fans in love with tuned cars.</div>]\n"

            "Review Text: The first film was BREAK POINT with cars. The second one was Miami VICE with cars. This is REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE... with more cars. To be honest, I kinda liked this one better than the last two, despite Lucas Black somehow beating Paul Walker as the least charismatic actor in a starring role. What I mainly like is the direction by Justin Lin. The focus on police undercover stories is dropped in favor of the street racing culture and its connections to the mob. Was actually delighted to see Sonny Chiba appear, I must have missed his name during the opening credits. Purely as a movie about car action, I think it succeeds better than the first two. There's a goofy quality to it that kinda helps one go along with things. Best to sum that up is Lucas Black smiling like a dork with blood on his teeth, living for the thrill. That's probably what this film series needed, and less soap opera/undercover drama. Consider me surprised.\n",

            "Review Text: This is an exciting narration of drifting auto racing with exceptionally fine camera work and great car chase sequences and crashes on the metropolitan streets. It deals about a rebel American adolescent named Shawn Boswell(Lucas Black as a determined race-car driver) challenges his contender for a race cars, causing wreak havoc racing 195 mph through streets. To avoid the jail, his mother(Lynda Boyd) sends him Tokyo where is his father(Brian Goodman) as US military. Meanwhile the newcomer Shawn tries to ingratiate with Twinkie(Nathalie Kelley) and the world of racing in Japan, and hoping to join his extended group. In Tokio he discovers the underworld of the Yazuka and competes against Drift kingpin who is niece of mobster chief(Sonny Chiba who does a credible job).The picture mingles action-packed,drama, exciting pursuits cars, suspense, a little bit of violence and spectacular sequences though won't mean much on little screen TV. Flashy, noisy race-cars set in the Japan by the producers, -the famous Neal Moritz-of first part. Pulse-quickening action but plenty of clichés and lots of dirty driving and heavier on crashes than coherency. All stunts were performed by authentic experts without people damage. Special cameo by Vin Diesel and appearance by Sonny Chiba, a Kung Fu idol of the 70s. Justin Lin's direction(previously made Annapolis and Better Luck tomorrow) is competent though the story eventually run out of gas. Justin Lin is directing the third part with Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster. The movie gives new meaning to the term ¨Tuning¨and ¨Drifting¨. The flick will like to adrenaline lovers and those young people looking for strong emotions. This is the kind of film in which the cars enthusiastic will enjoy immensely, it's a must see for cars fonds.\n",

The cinematography was phenomenal and the racing sequences were jaw dropping. Unfortunately, this movie lacks substance. The storyline was really iffy and probably not likely to happen and the acting was a little shaky.But thats not the reason why everyone goes to watch this movie. We all go to see the cars and the girls which fortunately delivers. Beautiful cars, beautiful ladies and beautiful scenery and destructive driving is never in short supply in this genre and the scenery of Japan is just breathtaking. All in all, just a movie you'll want to see with the boys.\n",

            "Rewatching the 2006 film The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, I find myself enjoying it more than most people seem to. So, here's an unpopular opinion: Tokyo Drift ties as my third favourite film in the series. The film ramps up the fun straight away, ditches the cheese of the second instalment, and goes for an original plot.One of the aspects I appreciate most about Tokyo Drift is its unique setting and storyline. Shifting the focus to Tokyo and introducing the world of drift racing feels fresh and exciting. The races and chases are some of the series' best, with a kinetic energy that keeps me engaged throughout. The soundtrack is another highlight, with its thumping beats perfectly complementing the high-speed action.I know people heap crap on it for not keeping it in the \"family,\" but it's an undeniably fun ride. The absence of the core characters initially feels strange, but the new cast manages to hold their own. Lucas Black as Sean Boswell brings a different kind of protagonist to the table, and I find his journey from outsider to drift racing aficionado quite compelling.The character of Han, played by Sung Kang, is a standout. His cool, mentor-like presence adds depth to the film and makes for some memorable moments. The Tokyo setting is visually stunning, and the film makes excellent use of its locations, showcasing the vibrant cityscape in a way that's both thrilling and immersive.What I like about Tokyo Drift is its ability to balance the adrenaline-pumping action with a story that feels grounded. The film doesn't rely on the over-the-top stunts that the later entries in the series do, and that simpler approach works in its favour.Overall, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a fairly positive experience that brings something fresh and exciting to the franchise. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, I find it to be a fun and engaging film that stands out in its own right.FORMAT: Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.0\n",

            "Title: The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is far better than I expected - but I had low expectations. Enjoyable but not critically appealing\n",
            "Review Text: I was quite surprised by The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift. Of course, I expected it to be a pile of steaming garbage, particularly with the formula of increasingly dodgy sequels. So when I went to see it with some friends, I had obvious misgivings. These misgivings, or at least the worst ones, such as the movie being unbearable to even look at, were fortunately unfounded. I kept my eyes on the movie the whole time, mainly because of the souped cars, but the fact that I went through the movie without flinching (a lot, except at some of the bad dialogue that was prevalent), says quite a lot. Maybe my view of The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift is heightened by the fact that I cracked a few jokes during the movie.Now down to business. Sean, a 'dude' who loves to race at high speeds for no apparent reason, is sent to Tokyo to live with his military dad and ends up being drawn to the racing circuit again, witnessing a new style of race called 'drift' (as seen in Need For Speed Underground, to those that don't know). Sounds stupid? Well, it is, the casual viewer can detect a plothole or two from even reading those two lines. To go on, except to state that Sean ends up making friends with a guy named Han, is pointless. I will admit that no-one looks for a good plot in a Fast and the Furious movie, but still, the less said, the better.The dialogue, as I stated, can be funny - because of its stupidity. This is shown by one piece of dialogue where some guy asks Sean: \"You know what DK stands for?\" and Sean replies \"Donkey Kong\". At least its original, I guess.The acting is OK - far from turgid, which I expected it to be in the first place. The guy who plays Han is surprisingly good, going through the movie without looking as if he was hired from a nearby sushi bar. Brian Tee as DK is a bit of a joke, he is more comedic than menacing. Lucas Black is OK as Sean, but his Southern accent makes his character more irritating to watch. The love interest does well as eye candy. That's about all that matters I guess.The most important part of The Fast and the Furious is inarguably the racing sequences and their overall effectiveness. I will admit that the sequences themselves are well-filmed and eye catching, highlighting the cars, as they should. However, except in a few fleeting moments, they are not as enthralling as they should be and this is one of the most disappointing aspects of The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift. The final confrontation, for me, is pretty good to watch, but only arouses the senses once in a while.Time didn't drag though, which is a clear sign that The Fast and Furious is indeed quite watchable, despite its other pre-eminent faults. I admit that I didn't really get bored during the film, which may lead to my rose-tinted view of it (compared to my original perception of what it would be like).So let me summarise my thoughts: \"Didn't expect much, got more than I bargained for.\" The acting is satisfactory (for a racing film, otherwise it would more or less suck), the plot and the dialogue are predictably terrible, the racing sequences are satisfactory and the cinematography is somewhat effective, with frequent close-ups of the cars. What compels me to give The Fast and The Furious a pass grade is the fact that it is, like I said, quite watchable. However, it is still little more than satisfactory, so it's rating cannot therefore rise above:2.5/5 stars\n",

            "Review Text: When teenage road-racer Sean Boswell (Lucas Black, who is too old for the part, but hey-ho) gets in trouble with the law for a third time, he avoids a jail sentence by going to live with his father in Tokyo; there, he becomes involved in the drift racing scene, coming to blows with DK (Brian Tee), the nephew of a powerful Yakuza.Tokyo Drift gets short shrift from some Fast & Furious fans because it steers the franchise away from the US street racing scene and because it doesn't star series regular Paul Walker. While it might be a slight step down from the previous entries, being a little too teen-centric with its predictably troublesome high school protagonist, I don't think it's all that bad. As a fan of all things Japanese, I can appreciate the colourful Tokyo setting, the Yakuza storyline, and, of course, all those oriental cuties in extremely short skirts.Director Justin Lin, who went on to helm parts 4, 5 and 6 in the series, handles the car scenes with aplomb, each race shifting up a gear in terms of adrenaline-pumping action. Drifting—sliding the car around sharp corners at high speed—adds a new level of excitement to the action, with a mountain road finale offering plenty of nerve jangling, edge-of-the-seat moments. The film closes with the reappearance of a familiar face, paving the way for further instalments.\n",

            "Review Text: An incurable addicted-to-speed young racer, Lucas Black, escapes to Tokyo to avoid jail after repeated arrests for racing. He joins his father, (who is estranged from his mother), in Tokyo where he runs into problems with other local race-aholics. The young American vies for the attention of gal who is linked to local Japanese racer, and the two rivals for affection eventually butt heads. This is the extent of plot you get in this tire-screeching, attitude and hormone churning, low-brow flick, where almost every character seems to be suffering from some form of personality disorder, or is just plain stupid. Somehow, in spite of a glaring lack of insight or smarts, the protagonist, a refugee from high school \"shop\" classes where he learned to work on cars, seems to master the Japanese language effortlessly. The Japanese characters in the flick are equally repulsive, or more so, as most are no more than thugs, with our hero's Japanese rival wrapped up in a Yakuza (Mafia) family. The movie is just a \"loser to bruiser\" story, as the young American masters the Japanese racing style, with flashy fast cars providing the backdrop for our hero's transformation. The movie does offer a generous supply of laughs, but I don't think that's what the director and company had intended.\n",

            "[<div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) have escaped to the Dominican Republic and resume their criminal ways. However when the cops close in on Dom, he decides to leave everything behind including Letty. Later he finds that Letty has been killed while working for drug baron Braga who is using street racers to drive his drugs across the border. Only he doesn't know that Letty was working for Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) as an informant. Now Dom and Brian are both trying to get Braga by infiltrating his group as drivers.<br/><br/>The family is back and the movie is so much the better for it. Director Justin Lin returns after Tokyo Drift. The franchise really missed the presence of Vin Diesel. The only minor disappointment are the car chases. They're good but just not great. They can be better. It's also sad to lose Letty so early on in the movie. It misses her energy.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">When Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is informed that his beloved Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) was assassinated, he returns to Los Angeles to find the murderer. Meanwhile, his former friend and FBI agent Brian Conner (Paul Walker) is assigned to capture the mysterious drug lord Braga that is looking for replacement drivers, working undercover as his courier, driving from Mexico to USA through the desert. Dom discovers that Letty was working as a courier for Braga when she was killed and he decides to join his gang to find the killer. Their lives entwine substantiating their friendship and Brian dates Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) again. But they need to find the true identity of Braga. <br/><br/>\"Fast &amp; Furious\" is a great adventure and an excellent entertainment as good as the first movie of this franchise. The chemistry between Paul Walker and Vin Diesel is amazing performing very likable characters. The talented Jordana Brewster is for me one of the most (if not the most) gorgeous actresses of her generation and I look forward to see her works. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): \"Velozes e Furiosos 4\" (\"Fast and Furious 4\")</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">After two films that strayed away from the very first that made the franchise popular, producers to The Fast and the Furious (2001) decided to finally bring back the original cast and big name stars. That was one of their best decisions that have been made. It's baffling to why they thought changing the cast would really benefit them in any way. All it does is create resent and a disconnect with the new characters. Fans don't appreciate that. However, this is not the only difference brought to this ongoing series. The original cast returns but the story changes. Oh yes, there's still an abundance racing cars but it's for a different reason.<br/><br/>The story reunites Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) again to help in the arrest of a Cartel who is secretly making drug shipments in and out of the border of Mexico. However, these events only happen under very coincidental circumstances. The writer behind this installment is Chris Morgan, the same man behind The Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006). Morgan's writing is articulated in a way that still incorporates racing but it's no longer about who's packing nitro next to their driver's seat anymore. That part, fans should enjoy and this is really its strongest element. However, what Morgan still can't accomplish is a narrative that is cohesive enough that makes sense in its continuity. Just why exactly was Tokyo Drift (2006) made if they planned on making a prequel to it 3 years later?<br/><br/>Also, the character of Brian O'Conner is getting a tad redundant. He still lies and he drops the FBI after 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003), but now is working for the FBI of L.A. And this would be fine and all if he would stop being such a rule breaker. O'Conner just can't seem to follow the rules he swore to uphold. Why doesn't he just stop working for the FBI - it doesn't benefit him. Thankfully, O'Conner no longer has a love interest problem. He's stuck with Mia and that's it. Character wise, there aren't much of any new appearances except for the antagonists. Toretto is back along with his girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodgriguez) and sister Mia (Jordana Brewster). The only character that makes a subtle change is Paul Walker at which most girls will think he's the next heartthrob. Instead of having wavy surfer hair and wearing casual clothing, he now has a tux and a straight crew cut. Yeah, I could see why.<br/><br/>The action is still fierce too. Instead of collaborating frequently on the town alleyways, the driving sequences also expand to broader horizons with larger landscapes and less tar. It'll give the audience something new to look at instead of the neon high beams and flashing traffic lights. The special effects also conform well to their surroundings; nothing looks out of place. Lastly, the franchise has finally found a solid contender to compose a score and that is Brian Tyler. During some very sentimental scenes, Tyler is able to emphasize those moments with the right emotion. Yet, Tyler is still lacking a distinctive theme for this franchise, which is a shame. He is an accomplished composer. Overall, a better sequel than the last two.<br/><br/>With the original cast back and a story that involves more than just fast cars, this installment starts to resurrect what it had going for it from the start. Its continuity nonetheless is a totally different issue that still needs addressing.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">i thought this prequel to Tokyo Drift was actually not bad.it starts off with a real adrenaline rush.the racing scenes are pretty good,as are the chase scenes.the story was good,and flowed well.there are quite a few dramatic moments in this film and they all work well.most of the original actors form the first film in the series are back,including Vin Diesel,Jordana Brewster Michele Rodriguez,and Paul Walker.i don't think it was as good as the first film,but it was a close second.i added it to my collection,and don't regret it.if you're a fan of the series,you should like this one.for me,Fast &amp; Furious is a well deserved 7/10</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Fast &amp; Furious (2009) is an awesome Action packed sequel, where The Fast and the Furious (2001) stopped. This is the real sequel to The Fast and The Furious. I love that Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster reprise their roles back to the roots the way they were. This is my fourth favorite best film in the series, this film Is a seat to the edge from the beginning till the end. This movie kept me thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. Sure it's a little far fetched, but who cares? <br/><br/>It's a movie, and definitely not as bad as some people are saying. Besides, the point of watching a movie is to escape reality so I don't understand why people complain when movies are not realistic. Provided a cinematic equivalent of NOS to the franchise with a tone shift that helped make it one of the most popular and profitable action series in the last decade. Excellent flick. Much better than the middle two. Just forget those movies happened. This was good balls to the walls action with much better actors with the original 4 back together. Bad idea making 2 and 3 :) <br/><br/>Vin Diesel and Paul Walker re team with Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster for the ultimate chapter of the franchise built on speed! When fugitive Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) returns to Los Angeles to avenge a loved one's death, it reignites his feud with agent Brian O'Conner (Walker). But, as they race through crowded city streets and across international lines, they must test their loyalties by joining together to bring down a shared enemy. From big rig heists to precision tunnel crawls, Fast &amp; Furious takes you back into the high-octane world, which lives for speed, drives for the rush and breaks all the rules!<br/><br/>\"Maybe you're the bad guy pretending to be the good guy.\" <br/><br/>This film is more about stopping a notorious drug lord Arturo Braga and avenging the murder of Letty (Michelle Rodriguez). This film is set back in Los Angles when everything started, after 5.years of leaving the city of Angeles for Dominican Republic after Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew become a Wanted Fugitives. Letty was murdered when she was mixed up in a drug racers mule cartel. She knew the people who hired her, will double crossed her, while trying to escape the flying bullets she was killed by a drug lord's henchman. That weary angrier Dom (Vin Diesel) brings him back to Los Angeles, to avenge his loved one's death and tracking down Drug Lord Braga and killing him. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), is now an FBI agent, and he is assigned to track down a notorious drug lord named Arturo Braga. Both men faces each other in a final showdown. Braga is looking for a fast drivers that are driving and smuggling trough desert New Mexico drugs. Brian goes again undercover only to find out that he and Dom (Vin Diesel) are been double crossed and set up on the same way that was Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) was. <br/><br/>This film is filled with full action, fast cars, full of stunts and beautiful women. Gal Gadot is tremendous as Gisele Harabo it was her first role in this film and she was awesome, she acted the character terrific. Paul walker was the best in this film, finally, finally they did something with the character, he become an FBI Agent which I love that with the character In this movie. I love that Dom (Vin Diesel) at the end of the film didn't run, he surrender and I love how Brian ( Paul Walker) was testifying for him in the court. Seriously this film Kicks ass, although I prefer Fast Five over this Action Flick, but that doesn't mean this film did not do the job right, it did! And this film is highly underrated and criticized by critics. Also Han (Sung Kang) has a small scene in the beginning of this film, that was before they killed the beloved character in The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006). <br/><br/>The rating I am giving to this film is 9. Anything below 7 would be ridiculous, if anyone would not say that this wasn't At least A GOOD ACTION FILM! (it is sure as hell better than all the comic movies that are getting high scores.)</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">This is one of these 107-minute testosterone movies guys crave every once in awhile, some more than others. Being a somewhat-old guy, I don't look as these as often anymore but every once in awhile it's fun to kick back and just watch fast cars, loose women, wild action and fairly-brainless film.<br/><br/>There isn't much of a plot but my guess is people who are fans of this film series don't care. Just give us the above - muscle cars, macho men, sexy babes and a few great chase scenes - and that's all that is asked. I thought the best scene was the first one, a chase down mountain in the Dominican Republic. That was like a James Bond opening scene: a real attention-getter.<br/><br/>After that, you get the normal F&amp;F material, which glamorizes things that shouldn't be (racing through crowded streets, etc.) but also has the \"good\" guys going to capture a drug lord from Mexico.....and a lot of punks along the way. They all sneer and have a lot of tattoos. <br/><br/>I've only seen this one and the first in the series but from what I read here, I've seen the two best of the four Fast &amp; Furious films. Vin Diesel helps make them a notch above the others, I suspect. He's always interesting as \"Dom Toretto\" and his character is the most credible.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Every time there is a fight scene, car chase or action sequence the camera shakes around all over the place and you can't see what's happening. What's the point of that? I gave up trying to watch it because I got a damn headache... Grrr</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">with these movies coming out to the theatre every other year now, and now I just looked on this site fast n furious 7 2014. I need to catch up with the series. Paul Walker returns with Vin Diesel along with Michelle rodriguez for #4. there are a lot more bad guys in this film I thought the idea of the Mexican drug cartel presented a few new ideas. there is lot's of action to be had here, the gasoline tanker's explosion,, the chases with all of the cars in the Mexican tunnels, with the chopper in pursuit of all of the vehicles. I like the idea of using the border as a character in the movie. because apparently you can only be tracked for so long either before or after you get across the border, I forget how that works. but there is lot's of good one liners in here for our characters to chew up, love all of the fast cars and the faster women,, although I wonder how many of these movies can they keep making,, don't get me wrong I like them very much, but at some point you have to sit back and say , I think we need something else.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Fast and Furious is certainly everything it promises, but that isn't a whole lot. We get all kinds of suped up cars that will give any sixteen year old the hots and the babes to make the illegal car racing all the more glamorous.<br/><br/>Now when I say it's all babes and cars I mean it, there isn't any new character development in any of the characters and the action, while good, is extremely basic, but at least it isn't terrible.<br/><br/>Entertaining for a viewing but it doesn't give us anything new to a franchise that has been extremely one note from the get go. Enjoy it and watch the racers act like rock stars! a very modest 6 out of 10</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Once again, it follows the same plot points as some of the previous installments but Fast and Furious is still fun and its beginning to embrace the ridiculousness. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker give great performances and it's nice to see them back in the same film. John Ortiz is a really good villain. The action and car chases are also really good as usual.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">This movie isn't the best movie of all time it isn't great cinema it is not citizen kane or the godfather and not die hard, or ocean 11 for action crime movies but is is a very entertaining movie with a badass vin diesel\n",
            "the acting is cheesy but the action and the cinematography is great in my opinion it is one of the best popcorn flicks it has explosions, car chases, racing, and a drug lord.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">I just saw this and to be honest I was hesitant in buying the $8 matinée ticket but wanted to see a movie and figured what the heck. First of all the 1st film was good, IMO the sequel and then Tokyo Drift were pretty bad but the 4th installment gave a ray of hope when I first saw the trailer. I liked the fact that it had a large part of the original cast.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film and was surprised. They actually wrote a good story and it flowed very well, the action and driving scene's were shot and edited superbly, you did get the feeling that you were in the car at times which adds to the intensity of the driving scenes. I also like the fact that they incorporated American muscle cars instead of just imports this way the movie will appeal to people of all tastes. Overall I was pleasantly surprised of how good the film was. Also the final scene of Phoenix's demise was different than the norm. Bottom line Go see it.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Towards the end of Tokyo Drift (2006) we saw a Vin Diesel returning. People were eager to wait if he really was coming back and he finally did here in number 4. And it do returns to the end of part 2. They only mention Tokyo once at the beginning with Han (Sung Kang) but none of the other actors from that part are here to see except for Han.<br/><br/>A return in fact to part 1 with Vin Diesel (Dominic Torreto) and Paul Walker (Brian O'Connor) in the main lead. The are teaming again together. From that moment we do see a classic Fast and Furious. Full of fast cars and chasing cars and of course here and there some nice chicks. The story was solid and gave people really what they want and not going to deep into the technical details of the cars like the first part or with clichés. Still, this is not for everybody but people who really love action with fast cars and a simple solid story they should pick up this franchise.<br/><br/>Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">A couple of nights ago I just got done watching F&amp;F Tokyo Drift.....I wish they would've left that one out of this magnificent series. It made ZERO sense that they would do a sequel without any of the main people from the previous movie. I gave that one a rating 6 out of 10 and I was probably being too nice.<br/><br/>But this one one, on the other hand.....brilliant. 9 out of 10!!!! The old characters are back, better story, better cars, better action.....awesome. The beginning had me clutching my chair and moving my head and body like I was actually there. Paul Walker (RIP)and Vin Diesel were amazing in this one as usual. It just gets me excited to watch the next one in the series.<br/><br/>Show me a classic Dodge/Plymouth, and I will be a fan forever.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">This might bring the audience a lot of questions about the return of the characters Brian O'Connor and specially Han Seoul-Oh after the events in The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift. Fast &amp; Furious is the sequel to the previous films 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003), followed by The Fast And The Furious (2001) and the prequel to The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006).<br/><br/>What that made this Fast &amp; Furious to be a better sequel than the 2003 film 2 Fast 2 Furious is that all the original casts return in this one. Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, Paul Walker as Brian O'Connor, Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto and Michelle Rodriguez as Leticia ''Letty'' Ortiz. The film also introduces new characters Fenix (Laz Alonso), Omar (Don Omar), Leo Tego (Tego Calderon), Cara Mirtha (Mirtha Michelle) and Campos (John Ortiz). Sung Kang who played Han Seoul-Oh in Tokyo Drift has also made a special appearance. We can briefly say that this is the direct sequel to the 2001 film. It begins from where it ended.<br/><br/>The film focuses mostly on swag, sex appeal, action, hunt and most importantly on the American Muscle cars. Why the film holds my attention is because the film promises on what is says in it's title: Fast &amp; Furious. It's definitely more fast and more furious than the original one. <br/><br/>It has passed 8 years since the last time Vin Diesel portrayed the character Dominic Toretto. He has pumped up his body and fits perfectly to be the legend of street racing. Paul Walker who portrayed Brian O'Connor is still phenomenal as he has always been in the previous Fast &amp; Furious films. Laz Alonso and John Ortiz have lived up in their roles.<br/><br/>Overall this is a perfect Saturday-night movie. If you want to see the classics in action then Fast &amp; Furious is definitely the one you do not want to miss!</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">This is a movie for the guys. Hot chicks, fast cars, big explosions, big stunts and big tuff men. But it's no movie for serious movie goers. No story, worthless sequel and just an excuse for a quick buck. Even though it had the same things the original had it didn't have the same effect. It was pretty much empty.<br/><br/>Even though the movie was bad it still had some awesome stunts. One of the only reasons this was watchable was the stunts. Everyone loves to see loud cars roaring through the air while a massive explosion burns behind them.<br/><br/>Back to where it started. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Michelle Rodriguez back together again. Another reason this was watchable. But they had to go ruin it by making a bad decision with one of the characters.<br/><br/>I recommend it if you like the series. It's really a hit or miss with this movie. A fan may find it better or worse then the previous movies. It should be decided on your own. I give Fast &amp; Furious...<br/><br/>4/10</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Fast and Furious is, in my opinion one of the high points of the Fast franchise. I could enjoy The Fast and the Furious for what it was. 2 Fast 2 Furious I could not really get into despite the awesome races. Fast and Furious is where I started to like and get into the franchise. There are many reasons for why this is.<br/><br/>I find the characters to be much better this time around. Vin Diesel's character, Dom toretto, is back with a vengeance. Him being back, and his character arc in this is one of the main reasons I like this film more than the previous ones. At the start of the film he leaves his gang because the police are gunning for him. He then gets a call from his sister saying Letty (Michelle Rodriguez's character) has been killed. Now Toretto is on a revenge mission to kill the person who killed Letty.(in fast and furious 6 we find out she isn't though.) This makes it more of a personal story for the characters, especially Toretto, which I like. I am also a fan of revenge stories, which made me enjoy this more.<br/><br/>I like Paul Walker's character, Brian o Connor, more here than any of the previous films. He seems more mature and professional here. In this film he has been reinstated as an FBI agent. I still do not really buy him as an FBI agent; he does come off as more professional and less of a punk in this movie. Jordana Brewster, from the first film, comes back as Mia, who is Brian's love interest. I thought she was fine, but she is not given much to do. The other characters are not much. Han Lu form Tokyo Drift returns here, as well as Letty. However, they only show-up in the beginning and then disappear from the movie. This story is really about Brian and Toretto.<br/><br/>The villain is also very lazy. The Fast films have never had strong villains, but I find this one particularly weak. The villain in this movie along with the villain in the first film is probably my least favourite villains of these movies.<br/><br/>The races are still fun to watch. The races here are probably some of my favourite of the franchise. Although there is some very obvious CGI used in some of the races and car chases which might take you out. There was CGI used in the previous films as well, but here it is particularly noticeable. The CG did irk me, but it did not ruin the action.<br/><br/>Overall, Fast and Furious is my second favourite Fast film so far. I definitely like it more than the films before it. I like the darker tone, as well as Vin Diesel and his character arc. The races were also good despite the noticeable CGI. For those who are fans of this franchise give this a look if you have not already.</div>]\n"

However when the cops close in on Dom, he decides to leave everything behind including Letty. Later he finds that Letty has been killed while working for drug baron Braga who is using street racers to drive his drugs across the border. Only he doesn't know that Letty was working for Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) as an informant. Now Dom and Brian are both trying to get Braga by infiltrating his group as drivers.The family is back and the movie is so much the better for it. Director Justin Lin returns after Tokyo Drift. The franchise really missed the presence of Vin Diesel. The only minor disappointment are the car chases. They're good but just not great. They can be better. It's also sad to lose Letty so early on in the movie. It misses her energy.\n",

Meanwhile, his former friend and FBI agent Brian Conner (Paul Walker) is assigned to capture the mysterious drug lord Braga that is looking for replacement drivers, working undercover as his courier, driving from Mexico to USA through the desert. Dom discovers that Letty was working as a courier for Braga when she was killed and he decides to join his gang to find the killer. Their lives entwine substantiating their friendship and Brian dates Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) again. But they need to find the true identity of Braga. \"Fast & Furious\" is a great adventure and an excellent entertainment as good as the first movie of this franchise. The chemistry between Paul Walker and Vin Diesel is amazing performing very likable characters. The talented Jordana Brewster is for me one of the most (if not the most) gorgeous actresses of her generation and I look forward to see her works.

            "Title: Original cast, different story\n",
            "Review Text: After two films that strayed away from the very first that made the franchise popular, producers to The Fast and the Furious (2001) decided to finally bring back the original cast and big name stars. That was one of their best decisions that have been made. It's baffling to why they thought changing the cast would really benefit them in any way. All it does is create resent and a disconnect with the new characters. Fans don't appreciate that. However, this is not the only difference brought to this ongoing series. The original cast returns but the story changes. Oh yes, there's still an abundance racing cars but it's for a different reason.The story reunites Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) again to help in the arrest of a Cartel who is secretly making drug shipments in and out of the border of Mexico. However, these events only happen under very coincidental circumstances. The writer behind this installment is Chris Morgan, the same man behind The Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006). Morgan's writing is articulated in a way that still incorporates racing but it's no longer about who's packing nitro next to their driver's seat anymore. That part, fans should enjoy and this is really its strongest element. However, what Morgan still can't accomplish is a narrative that is cohesive enough that makes sense in its continuity. Just why exactly was Tokyo Drift (2006) made if they planned on making a prequel to it 3 years later?Also, the character of Brian O'Conner is getting a tad redundant. He still lies and he drops the FBI after 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003), but now is working for the FBI of L.A. And this would be fine and all if he would stop being such a rule breaker. O'Conner just can't seem to follow the rules he swore to uphold. Why doesn't he just stop working for the FBI - it doesn't benefit him. Thankfully, O'Conner no longer has a love interest problem. He's stuck with Mia and that's it. Character wise, there aren't much of any new appearances except for the antagonists. Toretto is back along with his girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodgriguez) and sister Mia (Jordana Brewster). The only character that makes a subtle change is Paul Walker at which most girls will think he's the next heartthrob. Instead of having wavy surfer hair and wearing casual clothing, he now has a tux and a straight crew cut. Yeah, I could see why.The action is still fierce too. Instead of collaborating frequently on the town alleyways, the driving sequences also expand to broader horizons with larger landscapes and less tar. It'll give the audience something new to look at instead of the neon high beams and flashing traffic lights. The special effects also conform well to their surroundings; nothing looks out of place. Lastly, the franchise has finally found a solid contender to compose a score and that is Brian Tyler. During some very sentimental scenes, Tyler is able to emphasize those moments with the right emotion. Yet, Tyler is still lacking a distinctive theme for this franchise, which is a shame. He is an accomplished composer. Overall, a better sequel than the last two.With the original cast back and a story that involves more than just fast cars, this installment starts to resurrect what it had going for it from the start. Its continuity nonetheless is a totally different issue that still needs addressing.\n",

            "Review Text: Fast & Furious (2009) is an awesome Action packed sequel, where The Fast and the Furious (2001) stopped. This is the real sequel to The Fast and The Furious. I love that Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster reprise their roles back to the roots the way they were. This is my fourth favorite best film in the series, this film Is a seat to the edge from the beginning till the end. This movie kept me thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. Sure it's a little far fetched, but who cares? It's a movie, and definitely not as bad as some people are saying. Besides, the point of watching a movie is to escape reality so I don't understand why people complain when movies are not realistic. Provided a cinematic equivalent of NOS to the franchise with a tone shift that helped make it one of the most popular and profitable action series in the last decade. Excellent flick. Much better than the middle two. Just forget those movies happened. This was good balls to the walls action with much better actors with the original 4 back together. Bad idea making 2 and 3 :) Vin Diesel and Paul Walker re team with Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster for the ultimate chapter of the franchise built on speed! When fugitive Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) returns to Los Angeles to avenge a loved one's death, it reignites his feud with agent Brian O'Conner (Walker). But, as they race through crowded city streets and across international lines, they must test their loyalties by joining together to bring down a shared enemy. From big rig heists to precision tunnel crawls, Fast & Furious takes you back into the high-octane world, which lives for speed, drives for the rush and breaks all the rules!\"Maybe you're the bad guy pretending to be the good guy.\" This film is more about stopping a notorious drug lord Arturo Braga and avenging the murder of Letty (Michelle Rodriguez). This film is set back in Los Angles when everything started, after 5.years of leaving the city of Angeles for Dominican Republic after Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew become a Wanted Fugitives. Letty was murdered when she was mixed up in a drug racers mule cartel. She knew the people who hired her, will double crossed her, while trying to escape the flying bullets she was killed by a drug lord's henchman. That weary angrier Dom (Vin Diesel) brings him back to Los Angeles, to avenge his loved one's death and tracking down Drug Lord Braga and killing him. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), is now an FBI agent, and he is assigned to track down a notorious drug lord named Arturo Braga. Both men faces each other in a final showdown. Braga is looking for a fast drivers that are driving and smuggling trough desert New Mexico drugs. Brian goes again undercover only to find out that he and Dom (Vin Diesel) are been double crossed and set up on the same way that was Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) was. This film is filled with full action, fast cars, full of stunts and beautiful women. Gal Gadot is tremendous as Gisele Harabo it was her first role in this film and she was awesome, she acted the character terrific. Paul walker was the best in this film, finally, finally they did something with the character, he become an FBI Agent which I love that with the character In this movie. I love that Dom (Vin Diesel) at the end of the film didn't run, he surrender and I love how Brian ( Paul Walker) was testifying for him in the court. Seriously this film Kicks ass, although I prefer Fast Five over this Action Flick, but that doesn't mean this film did not do the job right, it did! And this film is highly underrated and criticized by critics. Also Han (Sung Kang) has a small scene in the beginning of this film, that was before they killed the beloved character in The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006). The rating I am giving to this film is 9. Anything below 7 would be ridiculous, if anyone would not say that this wasn't At least A GOOD ACTION FILM! (it is sure as hell better than all the comic movies that are getting high scores.)\n",

            "Review Text: This is one of these 107-minute testosterone movies guys crave every once in awhile, some more than others. Being a somewhat-old guy, I don't look as these as often anymore but every once in awhile it's fun to kick back and just watch fast cars, loose women, wild action and fairly-brainless film.There isn't much of a plot but my guess is people who are fans of this film series don't care. Just give us the above - muscle cars, macho men, sexy babes and a few great chase scenes - and that's all that is asked. I thought the best scene was the first one, a chase down mountain in the Dominican Republic. That was like a James Bond opening scene: a real attention-getter.After that, you get the normal F&F material, which glamorizes things that shouldn't be (racing through crowded streets, etc.) but also has the \"good\" guys going to capture a drug lord from Mexico.....and a lot of punks along the way. They all sneer and have a lot of tattoos. I've only seen this one and the first in the series but from what I read here, I've seen the two best of the four Fast & Furious films. Vin Diesel helps make them a notch above the others, I suspect. He's always interesting as \"Dom Toretto\" and his character is the most credible.\n",

Paul Walker returns with Vin Diesel along with Michelle rodriguez for #4. there are a lot more bad guys in this film I thought the idea of the Mexican drug cartel presented a few new ideas. there is lot's of action to be had here, the gasoline tanker's explosion,, the chases with all of the cars in the Mexican tunnels, with the chopper in pursuit of all of the vehicles. I like the idea of using the border as a character in the movie. because apparently you can only be tracked for so long either before or after you get across the border, I forget how that works. but there is lot's of good one liners in here for our characters to chew up, love all of the fast cars and the faster women,, although I wonder how many of these movies can they keep making,, don't get me wrong I like them very much, but at some point you have to sit back and say , I think we need something else.\n",

            "Review Text: Fast and Furious is certainly everything it promises, but that isn't a whole lot. We get all kinds of suped up cars that will give any sixteen year old the hots and the babes to make the illegal car racing all the more glamorous.Now when I say it's all babes and cars I mean it, there isn't any new character development in any of the characters and the action, while good, is extremely basic, but at least it isn't terrible.Entertaining for a viewing but it doesn't give us anything new to a franchise that has been extremely one note from the get go. Enjoy it and watch the racers act like rock stars! a very modest 6 out of 10\n",

Vin Diesel and Paul Walker give great performances and it's nice to see them back in the same film. John Ortiz is a really good villain. The action and car chases are also really good as usual.\n",

            "Review Text: I just saw this and to be honest I was hesitant in buying the $8 matinée ticket but wanted to see a movie and figured what the heck. First of all the 1st film was good, IMO the sequel and then Tokyo Drift were pretty bad but the 4th installment gave a ray of hope when I first saw the trailer. I liked the fact that it had a large part of the original cast.I enjoyed this film and was surprised. They actually wrote a good story and it flowed very well, the action and driving scene's were shot and edited superbly, you did get the feeling that you were in the car at times which adds to the intensity of the driving scenes. I also like the fact that they incorporated American muscle cars instead of just imports this way the movie will appeal to people of all tastes. Overall I was pleasantly surprised of how good the film was. Also the final scene of Phoenix's demise was different than the norm. Bottom line Go see it.\n",

            "Review Text: Towards the end of Tokyo Drift (2006) we saw a Vin Diesel returning. People were eager to wait if he really was coming back and he finally did here in number 4. And it do returns to the end of part 2. They only mention Tokyo once at the beginning with Han (Sung Kang) but none of the other actors from that part are here to see except for Han.A return in fact to part 1 with Vin Diesel (Dominic Torreto) and Paul Walker (Brian O'Connor) in the main lead. The are teaming again together. From that moment we do see a classic Fast and Furious. Full of fast cars and chasing cars and of course here and there some nice chicks. The story was solid and gave people really what they want and not going to deep into the technical details of the cars like the first part or with clichés. Still, this is not for everybody but people who really love action with fast cars and a simple solid story they should pick up this franchise.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5\n",

It made ZERO sense that they would do a sequel without any of the main people from the previous movie. I gave that one a rating 6 out of 10 and I was probably being too nice.But this one one, on the other hand.....brilliant. 9 out of 10!!!! The old characters are back, better story, better cars, better action.....awesome. The beginning had me clutching my chair and moving my head and body like I was actually there. Paul Walker (RIP)and Vin Diesel were amazing in this one as usual. It just gets me excited to watch the next one in the series.Show me a classic Dodge/Plymouth, and I will be a fan forever.\n",

            "Review Text: This is a movie for the guys. Hot chicks, fast cars, big explosions, big stunts and big tuff men. But it's no movie for serious movie goers. No story, worthless sequel and just an excuse for a quick buck. Even though it had the same things the original had it didn't have the same effect. It was pretty much empty.Even though the movie was bad it still had some awesome stunts. One of the only reasons this was watchable was the stunts. Everyone loves to see loud cars roaring through the air while a massive explosion burns behind them.Back to where it started. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Michelle Rodriguez back together again. Another reason this was watchable. But they had to go ruin it by making a bad decision with one of the characters.I recommend it if you like the series. It's really a hit or miss with this movie. A fan may find it better or worse then the previous movies. It should be decided on your own. I give Fast & Furious...4/10\n",

            "Review Text: This might bring the audience a lot of questions about the return of the characters Brian O'Connor and specially Han Seoul-Oh after the events in The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift. Fast & Furious is the sequel to the previous films 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003), followed by The Fast And The Furious (2001) and the prequel to The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006).What that made this Fast & Furious to be a better sequel than the 2003 film 2 Fast 2 Furious is that all the original casts return in this one. Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, Paul Walker as Brian O'Connor, Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto and Michelle Rodriguez as Leticia ''Letty'' Ortiz. The film also introduces new characters Fenix (Laz Alonso), Omar (Don Omar), Leo Tego (Tego Calderon), Cara Mirtha (Mirtha Michelle) and Campos (John Ortiz). Sung Kang who played Han Seoul-Oh in Tokyo Drift has also made a special appearance. We can briefly say that this is the direct sequel to the 2001 film. It begins from where it ended.The film focuses mostly on swag, sex appeal, action, hunt and most importantly on the American Muscle cars. Why the film holds my attention is because the film promises on what is says in it's title: Fast & Furious. It's definitely more fast and more furious than the original one. It has passed 8 years since the last time Vin Diesel portrayed the character Dominic Toretto. He has pumped up his body and fits perfectly to be the legend of street racing. Paul Walker who portrayed Brian O'Connor is still phenomenal as he has always been in the previous Fast & Furious films. Laz Alonso and John Ortiz have lived up in their roles.Overall this is a perfect Saturday-night movie. If you want to see the classics in action then Fast & Furious is definitely the one you do not want to miss!\n",

            "Review Text: Fast and Furious is, in my opinion one of the high points of the Fast franchise. I could enjoy The Fast and the Furious for what it was. 2 Fast 2 Furious I could not really get into despite the awesome races. Fast and Furious is where I started to like and get into the franchise. There are many reasons for why this is.I find the characters to be much better this time around. Vin Diesel's character, Dom toretto, is back with a vengeance. Him being back, and his character arc in this is one of the main reasons I like this film more than the previous ones. At the start of the film he leaves his gang because the police are gunning for him. He then gets a call from his sister saying Letty (Michelle Rodriguez's character) has been killed. Now Toretto is on a revenge mission to kill the person who killed Letty.(in fast and furious 6 we find out she isn't though.) This makes it more of a personal story for the characters, especially Toretto, which I like. I am also a fan of revenge stories, which made me enjoy this more.I like Paul Walker's character, Brian o Connor, more here than any of the previous films. He seems more mature and professional here. In this film he has been reinstated as an FBI agent. I still do not really buy him as an FBI agent; he does come off as more professional and less of a punk in this movie. Jordana Brewster, from the first film, comes back as Mia, who is Brian's love interest. I thought she was fine, but she is not given much to do. The other characters are not much. Han Lu form Tokyo Drift returns here, as well as Letty. However, they only show-up in the beginning and then disappear from the movie. This story is really about Brian and Toretto.The villain is also very lazy. The Fast films have never had strong villains, but I find this one particularly weak. The villain in this movie along with the villain in the first film is probably my least favourite villains of these movies.The races are still fun to watch. The races here are probably some of my favourite of the franchise. Although there is some very obvious CGI used in some of the races and car chases which might take you out. There was CGI used in the previous films as well, but here it is particularly noticeable. The CG did irk me, but it did not ruin the action.Overall, Fast and Furious is my second favourite Fast film so far. I definitely like it more than the films before it. I like the darker tone, as well as Vin Diesel and his character arc. The races were also good despite the noticeable CGI. For those who are fans of this franchise give this a look if you have not already.\n",

            "[<div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">This is the film that single-handedly got me to give the rest of the series a shot, for better or worse. It's a nice change of pace from the previous films where it abandons the street race angle (how far could you have taken that anyway?) and goes into the direction of a heist action flick with cars. Dwayne Johnson is a great addition and really adds to the series embracing the goofiness of its premise. So yeah, still the best this franchise had, and that's kind of rare for a franchise on its fifth film. The action for the most part is really handled well and a lot of fun to watch. The cast as an ensemble are very charismatic which no doubt makes it more fun for audiences to see a cast that has so much diversity and it's not done with generic stereotypes but just a bunch of people with a common interest. Overall a very entertaining action flick.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Now when a long running series like The Fast And The Furious get sequels it is always a challenge to go out and try impress movie goers.<br/><br/>However the series always tops itself with the recent sequels and Fast Five proof that's anything is possible with the right minds.<br/><br/>The plot this time take place after Fast and Furious 4 left all with Brian O'Conner played by Paul Walker, Dominic Teretto Played by Vin Diesel, Mia Toretto played by Jordana Brewster head for Brazil to escape the law after a job with Vince Played by Matt Schulze went wrong. <br/><br/>Which leads to them being hunted by Luke Hobbs Played by Dwayne Johnson who along with Elena Played by Elsa Pataky begin to hunt them down. <br/><br/>Also returning are Roman Played by Tyrese Gibson, Tej Played by Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Han Played by Sung Kang, Gisele played by Gal Gadot. <br/><br/>Reyes Played by Joaquim de Almeida who serves as the Film Main Antagonist.<br/><br/>Story wise the plot is very good because it features the return of many of the characters from the series which is very good and moves the series along. Plus the film requires you to pay attention or you'll miss something. Plus you see the characters grow in this film from the last films.<br/><br/>What drives the film like the other films is that the stunts from start to finish that defines The Laws of Physic and why I love this series because the cast and crew are always driven to push the limits and hold nothing back, Fast Five is the example of it.<br/><br/>There is just a lot for this film that I recommend seeing for yourself where you'll be amazed and how you can do a sequel with the right minds.<br/><br/>With awesome stunts, great action and plot you'll be glad you watch this film.<br/><br/>I give Fast Five an 8 out of 10</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Amazing action, cars, solid story, comedic, and very entertaining! What more could you ask for except for epicness! I love all the badness in it and Tyrees Gibson is always a delight so is everyone else. Great Fast and furious for any fan of the series or not. Exhilarating as well too!</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Fast Five (2011) is one of the best Action heist films of all 5. film series of all time. This film reunites all actors from the previous films. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster , Tyrese Gibson , Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang, Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot, Tego Calderon and Don Omar, the gang are all here! They are all cast from the previous installments. <br/><br/>\n",
            "The Director brings all new actors in the cast crew: Joaquim de Almeida, Dwayne Johnson and Elsa Pataky. The script, the players, the action scenes, the story. Everything about this film is awesome! This film kicks ass. Is my second favorite best film in the series franchise. This film for me even beats Furious 7. Cause Furious 7 is not that good as this film is. The far of the highest best films ever. It's actually probably my favorite movie that I've ever seen. If you like any of the other fast and furious movies SEE THIS ONE!!!!! It's a Epic movie watch it till all the way to the end.<br/><br/>Fast Five picks up, literally, right where Fast &amp; Furious left off. Dom (Vin Diesel) is on his way to prison when his partner, former undercover detective Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), and his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) stage a daring (albeit highly unlikely) prison-bus break. On the run from the police, the FBI and the media, the three hightail it across the border and head even further south, all the way to Rio de Janeiro. There, they decide to lay down, lay low and avoid any unwanted attention. Nah, I'm just kidding. They do what any international fugitives would do: rob a train, double cross a local crime lord named Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) and his right-hand man Zizi (Michael Irby), put themselves on the radar of a ludicrously musclebound U.S. Diplomatic Security Service agent (Dwayne Johnson), and set out to steal untold millions from Reyes. That's right, it's One Last Heist for Dom and Brian. Not that anyone should be foolish enough to think this is the last we'll see of the led-foot duo; not after Fast Five revved up $600 million at the worldwide box office. (Be sure to sit through the first chunk of end credits for a nice little surprise.) Fast Five boasts incredible action scenes that are all varied and equally exciting. The film is full of clean, well choreographed shots that are easy to watch and the cast works great as a whole unit, making the film's running time breeze by. The heist in Rio De Janeiro was amazing An energetic, high-octane. The film was brilliant and smart it was action fun Entertained. The fight scenes between Dwayne Jonson and Vin Diesel was tremendous. I was happy that they put someone (Dwayne Jonson) in the movie that was so smart like Dom (Vin Diesel) was. Luke Hobbs as A Diplomatic Security Service agent to track down Dom and his crew was awesome! He did a brilliant job In this Action packed sequel film! Just Lin deliver us a high octane Action packed story filled with full of cars and shootings in his film.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Dwayne Johnson lead this all-star all-action movie with outrageous stunts, incredible cars and beautiful girls that pushes the limits into the red and beyond! The legendary Dom Torreto (Vin Diesel) partners with outlaw cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) on the opposite side of the law in exotic Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Hunted by ruthless Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and an army of corrupt cops working for a deadly drug kingpin. Torreto and O'Conner reunite the gang from previous Fast adventures to pull off one last job - an insane heist worth $100 million! <br/><br/>\"Five Times The Action!, Five Times the Fury!\" <br/><br/>I love this film to death and I love how they were planning to rob a Police Station. The first half was a little boring, but the second half was fast paced entertained filled with action. I love this film and everything about it. I love that it is 2.hrs long so that it can tell the whole story.<br/><br/>When developing Fast Five, Universal Studios deliberately departed from the street racing theme prevalent in previous films in the series, to transform the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By doing so, they hoped to attract wider audiences that might otherwise be put off by a heavy emphasis on cars and car culture. Fast Five is considered the transitional film in the series, featuring only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as gun fights, brawls, and the heist of $100 million. The production mounted a comprehensive marketing campaign, marketing the film through social media, virtual games, cinema chains, automobile manufacturers, and at NASCAR races.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">This is the best Fast and furious movie in my opinion. The franchise reinvented itself here and the series really benefited from it. This had a much better and believable plot and of course the Rock made the movie really good as well. 8.5/10</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Sure the original was something fresh, new, and somewhat original. But the sequels have been anything but. Yeah i know it's high octane fun, but you can say the same thing about Michael Bay films. Am i saying that these sequels are as bad as Michael Bay films? No, but each one offers nothing new, well, unless you count drifting, and that isn't saying a lot. Hopefull this new installment can bring something fresh to the table.<br/><br/>I never thought i would say this, but i actually enjoyed this movie. I went in with low expectations, and came out pretty damn satisfied. Sure the movie had a lot of the same moving parts, but what really made this one stand out is how it actually changed the pace of how they normally do things.<br/><br/>First, they didn't have a damn drag race every 10 minutes. In fact, they barely had any. Which really is a genius idea, because when the time did come to have an awesome driving sequence, you were begging for it. Finally, someone with brains stepped into this movie and said let's save all of our bullets and unleash them in the end.<br/><br/>So with a series that relies heavily on their driving sequences and less on their script, how do you keep your audience entertained? Well, the first step is to incorporate another major actor, enter The Rock. Next, you really need to buff up your script. Okay, here is where it gets both good and bad. It's good because the movie takes a ton of it's credit from the \"Ocean 11\" films. Yeah, it's stealing an idea, but it injecting more action into it, which is pretty cool. But the reason why i say it's also bad, is because it's still packed with bad cheesy one-liners, poor acting, and some really tarnished plot outlines. But does that take anything away from the fun.......not really.<br/><br/>Bottom Line, okay people, here is your first action movie worth seeing this year. No, i am not one of those people who hold these 'Fast and Furious' films on a high pedestal. Not since the first one have i given anything over a decent review. But i can say with confidence that this one is actually worth your hard earned dollar. Sure it's slightly cheesy, packed with impossible action, and sure it steals some plot outlines from other films, but i like i said earlier, it's still fun to watch. So with that being said, the question remains.....is this the best one in the series? I still say no, but this movie comes damn close. Closer that any of the other ones, thats for damn sure. On a time line, this should have followed up the original</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Without a shadow of a doubt, The Fast And Furious Franchise reaches it's peak in this installment with breathtaking action and a sense of friendship and brotherhood shared by the lead characters. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker return and are joined by newcomer Dwayne Johnsson for the 5th Fast and Furious Movie, entitled ''Fast Five''. There's not much to say about this, the action movie of the year, except it's fantastic shots of Brazil, the heist plot that brings even more excitem«ent to the table and overall the continuation of the story of these characters we have come to love and support, as their bond streghtens over time.<br/><br/>In Conclusion, if you love the franchise then you can't miss it<br/><br/>9/10</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">\"Home sweet home\" utters Diesel's beefcake criminal Dom Toretto to Walker's baby-faced ex-cop Brian O'Conner as they sit in Toretto's souped up muscle car ready to race along the streets of Rio de Janeiro. There's more than a hint of irony in this; fans of the Fast franchise will know exactly what Dom means. The sequels spawned from the highly successful first film have been a mixed bag appealing to different tastes. Some have been mildly entertaining in their own way, but the one major issue they've all shared is a lack of recurring characters and follow-on narratives. 2009's Fast &amp; Furious partially rectified that by having the main four from the original movie return, but it's this fifth entry that really starts to bring the whole series together.<br/><br/>There's supporting characters from every instalment featured here – Matt Schulze's Vince from number one; Tyrese's big-mouthed Roman and Ludicrous' Tej from 2 Fast 2 Furious; Sung Kang's charismatic Han from Tokyo Drift; and Gal Gadot's sexy Gisele from F&amp;F – with a post-credits cameo to cap it off. Scribe Chris Morgan has obviously done his homework as, in addition to the 'who's who' line-up of co-stars, there are references to the previous movies (and characters that don't appear) and he introduces subplots that help build on earlier story lines. This integration of the Fast universe, along with the marvellously tongue-in-cheek mood, notches up a level of interest not before seen in the car-crazy franchise.<br/><br/>After taking a new course with Tokyo Drift, and failing to impress with Fast &amp; Furious, filmmaker Justin Lin has well and truly ignited the series with exciting set pieces and lashings of well placed humour. He still struggles to effectively call the shots when exposition (or mere conversation) is required; however he clearly has a handle on shooting the various fast-paced action scenes. There is a spectacular heist of luxury cars aboard a train (with a marvellously ridiculous denouement); a Bourne-esque free-running chase along roof tops; and a bruising hand-to-hand melee between The Rock and big Vin.<br/><br/>Of the major stars, it's Fast newcomer Dwayne Johnson who shines the brightest. His epic bad-ass cop makes Toretto look like an absolute sissy, which is no easy feat. He also boasts many of the film's greatest lines and comes away looking the least corny – something Diesel and Walker are evidently use to by now. The chalk and cheese pairing of the two wannabe action stars brings with it a decent slab of shonky acting. Chrome-domed Diesel is especially silly and unconvincing when required to open his mouth, but he looks good behind the wheel of a car and adds plenty to the unapologetic macho atmosphere.<br/><br/>Thanks to Morgan's decent script, Lin's solid grasp on the action and Johnson's tough-as-nails turn, this latest addition to a franchise that appeared to be running on fumes has just stepped on the gas.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Average, 3 - Good, 4 - Great, 5 - Brilliant)</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">The former agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and his girlfriend Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) rescue her brother Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) during the transportation to the prison and they flee to Rio de Janeiro. <br/><br/>They rob a car from custody and find that the powerful drug lord Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) has a US$ 100,000.00 in a safe located inside the police station and protected by corrupt policeman. Dominic invites his skilled crew to steal the dirty money and achieve their freedom, moving to a country without extradition to the USA. Meanwhile the tough FBI agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) comes to Brazil with an elite force to arrest Dominic and Brian.<br/><br/>\"Fast Five\" is an entertaining action film, with cartoonish shootings and fights and an insane car race that destroys dozens of cars and locations. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Dwayne Johnson are synonym of great action scenes, and is nice to see the gorgeous Jordana Brewster that speaks a perfect Portuguese and Elsa Pataky.<br/><br/>For Brazilian and specially \"cariocas\" (natives from Rio de Janeiro), this film is also a comedy with the stereotyped Rio and a great quantity of mistakes. Most of the scenes are shot in Puerto Rico; most of the accent of actors speaking Portuguese are not from Rio but from São Paulo or from native in Spanish; Hernan Reyes is not a Brazilian name and Joaquim de Almeida is an actor from Portugal; there are ridiculous geographical mistakes, like for example, the references to the noble areas of Avenida Atlântica and Leblon. The sequences in the slums are also funny, since the modus operandi of armed drug dealers is totally different, using snipers from the top of the hills and barriers in the accesses to avoid the police and paramilitary forces. An American force would never have jurisdiction in Brazil. Last but not the least, there are many corrupt cops in Brazil, but never in such level. <br/><br/>I do not understand why the production has not used Brazilian actors and actresses in supporting roles to giver credibility to the footages with the external landscapes of Rio de Janeiro. My vote is six.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): \"Velozes &amp; Furiosos 5 - Operação Rio\" (\"Fast &amp; Furious 5 – Operation Rio\")</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Yeah out of all the movies, this one still stands as my favorite! It basicly have everything you can ask for from a Fast and Furious movie!<br/><br/>This movie Feels like the finale movie in the series, as it brings together our favorite characters from the previous movies, in the current timeline! It is over the top, but not as much as the later entries! The plot is also easy to understand, and not overly complex!<br/><br/>This is an easy to enjoy action packed thrillride, with emotional, satisfying and intense moments! The last part of the movie is just bonkers and i LOVE it! The movie introduces \"The Rock\" as Luke Hobbs, whom is my favorite antagonistic force in this series!<br/><br/>Overall this is just a solid action-movie!</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">There's a limit to how many sequels you can make to an action movie that was not very smart to begin with and still end up with something watchable. They change the scenery a bit, one-up the carnage and the special effects, add a little seasoning and shake well.<br/><br/>The thing that made the Fast and the Furious really good was always the fast cars and the portrayal of the street racer subculture with some crime and action on the side. Unfortunately Fast Five fails to deliver the proved formula - the action is too prominent, and frankly feels ridiculous most of the time. The street racing and the tuner scene are moved to the side to make room for more gunfights and ridiculous action scenes. The plot is predictably weak and while the regular cast makes a good effort of keeping the whole thing afloat, their efforts are undermined by some of the new faces (anyone like wrestling?).<br/><br/>The whole thing feels like a meaningless series of action scenes glued together with a few romantic moments meant to tend the female demographic. There is no sense of flow throughout the movie and I never felt part of the action, it was not even remotely believable. I wish I could say that the movie was not really bad, just mediocre but that would be lying. Spare yourself some disappointment and go watch something else.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">'FAST FIVE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>I was never a big fan of the original 'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS' and thought it was severely over-hyped. With each sequel though I think the franchise has gotten better (although I never saw the third chapter: 'TOKYO DRIFT'). This one (for the first time) brings together key cast members from all of the other films including Vin Diesel (who sat out the second film and only did a cameo in the third), Paul Walker (who was absent from the third film), Jordana Brewster (who missed the second and third films) as well as Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang, Cal Gadot and Tego Calderon (who all co-starred in one or two of the other films). It also adds Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson to the cast and fans finally get to see a long anticipated fight scene between he and Vin Diesel. The film is directed by Justin Lin (who also directed the last two films) and written by Chris Morgan (who wrote the last two films as well). It all adds up to a pretty entertaining action film that should definitely please most fans of the genre as well as fans of the franchise.<br/><br/>The film opens directly where the last one left off with former FBI agent turned outlaw Brian O'Conner (Walker) and girlfriend Mia (Brewster) breaking Mia's brother and Brian's buddy and partner in crime Dominic Toretto (Diesel) out of prison, by attacking the prison bus he's on. They then flee to Brazil and due to a botched car heist (where DEA agents are murdered) they're moved to the top of America's most wanted list. The baddest federal agent around, Lucas Hobbs (Johnson), is then put on assignment to track them down. O'Conner and Toretto then decide to pull one last big job on the crooked businessman, Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), who framed them by stealing $100 million of his laundered money. They bring in a team of former associates to help them pull off the heist.<br/><br/>The movie is really predictable and the story and character development pretty routine but the action scenes are amazing. The film does drag a little in the middle, during the overlong heist setup part of the film but for the most part it's really fast paced and thrilling. The stunts are some of the best ever performed (probably) and the amount of sheer destruction in the film is astonishing. There are several scenes that seriously push the realm of logic and reality but it's all in good senseless fun. The Rock makes a cool addition to the series and the fight scene between him and Diesel doesn't disappoint. The film is most likely everything you think it's going to be and it delivers exactly what it promises. In that sense it's definitely a success and in my opinion at least a little better than all the others in the franchise (just adding the Rock makes it that much better).<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_pFXcDSfo</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">I enjoyed the movie so much, that I came onto IMDb and registered myself just so that I can post a review. <br/><br/>The movie was packed with jaw dropping, eye popping action from beginning to end. The drama had a mix of sadness, comedy and seriousness which were all mixed in together so beautifully to give a consistency to keep the viewer starring at the screen and being involved in the movie rather than daydreaming about other things. <br/><br/>In my honest opinion I would say that it is the best Fast &amp; Furious movie to date. <br/><br/>I want to go see it again!<br/><br/>(by the way, I realise that this isn't the best review in the world or might even be an awful review, the point is that I enjoyed the movie thoroughly and felt I should contribute to it's high average ratings).</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Very early in this film Paul Walker's character is hanging off the side of a speeding train in urgent need to get off before it hits the bridge. Instead of jumping to the ground and hoping he can roll his speed down, he jumps to a speeding car seconds before an explosion and then goes with that car as it flies off a cliff into a several hundred meter drop into a lake. At this point my girlfriend asked how any of that had been easier than just jumping onto the ground considering that hitting water from that height is similar to hitting concrete. I couldn't argue her logic but I did have to explain that her logic and attention to detail have no place in a film franchise that has hit its fifth instalment without ever suggestion that logic or plotting are anywhere near as important as a shot of a young woman's ass and a love of fast cars.<br/><br/>And that is the problem with Fast Five that you need to overcome, it will at no point do much with the plot unless it knows it can get from that bit of plotting to the next car, gun or ass scene with minimal effort. It is a summer movie though and the \"Five\" in the title does mean that you should know what you're coming to with it. So I did my best to overlook the plot which is messy and a lacking logic at pretty much every turn – I over look it because I'm happy to surrender logic if the film can give me thrills and action. Mostly the film does, or at least it gives spectacle. Whether it is the foot escape over favela roofs or the ridiculous destruction derby of the robbery itself, the film provides you with a lot to look at and as such it is entertaining as spectacle. Personally I though the whole film could have greatly benefited from being tighter outside of these scenes and needed an injection of actual danger and tension. Instead everything happens and our characters and their cars seem indestructible, which does rather detract from the action because the viewer doesn't really \"care\" or worry about what is going on – it is all about just the spectacle. Although, like I said, it does do this well.<br/><br/>Previous films in this series have had terrible effects and some awful CGI cars (that look CGI). I'm sure computer effects were in use here but mostly it doesn't show – specifically the car chases and scenes of destruction are satisfyingly real; again they may be effects but they are very good if they are because you do have the satisfying feel of stunt men working hard in the real world – something so many effects-driven blockbusters forget about now that computers can do so much. Matching the spectacle the cast mostly do what they are required to do by looking great. Paul Walker remains good-looking and has the sparkle in his eye that makes him fun to watch in these film. Alongside him Vin Diesel looks like he is half asleep in the most part and in this film his presence is massively damaged by having to be compared to The Rock. The Rock may not have much to do but he has great presence and a real brutal charm – arms the size of tree-trunks also help his \"character\" but, like I said, it makes Diesel look dull and out-of-shape by comparison (although the dull one is certainly true). Outside of them Brewster is OK despite having little to do, Tyrese brings his mouth but not the homoerotic comedy that he brought to the second film while both Pataky and Gadot have tremendous figures. Ludicrous, Kang and others in the gang appear to be in for fans of the franchise but it gives too many characters to care about – in terms of excitement and making the film tighter, it would have been better with a smaller group and tighter focus.<br/><br/>Overall Fast Five is a fun film in a franchise that has seen some poor ones already. It provides spectacle and noise which is all one can ask for – even if I would have loved it to be tighter, more dramatic.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Ten years after the inception of the fast car action film phenomenon, Fast Five takes the U.S. box office by storm beginning summer early this year. Director Justin Lin (\"Anapolis\") achieves an opening box office numbers north of 80 mil by amassing all of the franchise's most badass stars including Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Sung Kang, Matt Schulze along with adding the brute power of Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson. As expected, there is no plot or character development what so ever, immediately throwing the audience into the escape of Dominic \"Dom\" Toretto (Diesel) sentenced to twenty-five years in prison, facilitated by ex-cop Brian O'Connor (Walker) and Mia Toretto (Brewster). Following Dom's escape, Brian and Mia seek the help of an old friend, Vincent (Schulze), in Rio de Janeiro undertaking a job to steal three cars from a moving train as they wait for Dom's arrival. The heist goes amiss, however, they learn two things, first, they cannot trust anyone and second this is just the tip of the iceberg of the ticket to their freedom. Dom, Brian and Mia commence the biggest robbery the series has ever seen with a 100 million dollar target from the most corrupt and powerful man in Rio, Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). Needless to say, they call Roman Pearce (Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Han (Sung Kang) among other franchise favorites to evade the clutches of Reyes and U.S. federal agent Luke Hobbs (Johnson).<br/><br/>Not many sequels stand up to their first installments, however, after four semi-entertaining sexy action thrillers struggling to create a worthwhile plot, \"Fast Five\" does more than equivocating its predecessors. The film's over the top ridiculous scope leaves very little room for slow boring moments. Instead it is full of pointless action scenes including a five-minute foreseeable faceoff between Diesel and Johnson. The battle of the brawny is accompanied by the battle of the sexy between Jordana Brewster and newcomer Elsa Patakay (local Rio cop Elema Neves). And yes there are ego driven car races.<br/><br/>The same reasons that make \"Fast Five\" better than its predecessors make the film the true mess that it is. A completely flawed grandiose plot combined with ridiculously bad acting and Tyrese Gibson's cliché one-liners and Johnson's childish clever phrases such as \"Now give me the veggies\" make the script seem like something a 13 year old thought up while playing Need For Speed with his friends. However, by disregarding plot development and clever writing, \"Fast Five\" has broken through the bonds that have always been holding the series back.<br/><br/>In the end, nothing stands in the films way as the writers completely shirk their job letting the cast loose through a labyrinth of explosive fun. All that matters is that \"Fast Five\" is the epitome of a Hollywood moneymaker. It is entertainment.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">I went into this movie expecting the usual; fast cars and hot babes held together with a more than flimsy action-packed story line and Justin Lin seemed to schizophrenically deliver (or did he?). The movie starts with a famously stolen and instantly aggravating \"one last job\" scene, obviously not something any movie goer can believe in this instance because let's face it who finishes a movie series on its fifth? This movie sees the return of all the usual (and previous) F&amp;F characters and same tricks of the trade we have seen Brian and Dom perfect with all the usual so-called tense last minute escapes Hollywood has rinsed dry, yet still this movie does deserve its 7/10 rating.<br/><br/>How? Rio and the favelas are beautifully shot, the new characters are refreshing and VERY well casted, the vehicles are awesome, although lacking in their usual \"bling\" quality and the witty humour running through from previous F&amp;F's is a little bonus for fans of the previous movies. Coupled with a sprinkling of nail biting moments and generous helpings of laugh-out-loud moments this testosterone injected movie is no doubt a fun, easy on the mind movie to go and watch.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, like all \"fun and easy on the mind\" movies, the simplicity of it all becomes very predictable and the same is true for this movie. The story line, although containing a couple of very interesting screws, is essentially like any other heist movie we've all seen before (you already know the conclusion and you always wonder where they magically get all that military level kit from). The fight scenes have obvious outcomes, the alliances of certain characters are openly questionable and the character of Matt Schulze (Vince) is more pointless than jet skiing in your 15 meter, back garden swimming pool.<br/><br/>The UNENDING swarms of mind-blowingly beautiful women and roaring hot cars are haplessly missing in the trial to create a more interesting storyline, which has only lead to needless additions into the story which add nothing to the overall plot. This movie is like a man in his late 20's desperate to become something more yet hold onto his youth and ending up messing up on both fronts. There's a token nitrous moment amidst the scores of needless carnage and overflowing testosterone levels from the tanking cast and developments in Brian and Mia's relationship add nothing to the story.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is enjoyable but lacks the zing of maybe the first two. It falls short of a modern day epic man-movie like the \"expendables\" and clearly lacks the strong storyline and acting prowess of a brilliant modern day heist movie like \"the bank job\". Saying that, it would still be a shame to miss this movie.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Fast Five - you'd think by the fifth instalment the Fast &amp; Furious franchise would have run out of nos but this film really 'packs a punch'. Think of what you expect from this film, and then make it really amazing! Great chases - all kinds! -, great fist fights (Vin Diesel vs. The Rock..!!), great action sequences.... everything you would want from this film is IN IT and if you suspend all disbelief and go with it, its done brilliantly. Even the cheesy lines and plot twists become enjoyable.<br/><br/>Not sure I'd pay a full adult weekend cinema price to see it, but if you can get 241 or a student discount, definitely see it on the big screen! Or wait for the blu-ray. Either way, you won't regret it when you see the beads of sweat running off The Rock's huge, bald head. Weird.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">The latest in the Fast and Furious franchise has recently hit the screens and what with the others being a good way to spend a few hours I was hoping for a similar type of movie from this one with plenty of great cars and car chases to boot.<br/><br/>Set after Fast &amp; Furious (No. 4) but before The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (No. 3), this time the action is played out in Rio, Brazil after Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) has escaped from police custody in the US with help from his old pal Brian (Paul Walker) and sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) and gone into hiding. With them needing money to disappear forever, Dom hatches a plan to steal all the money from Rio's most reputable underworld kingpin Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida).<br/><br/>At the same time they are being hunted down by the elite federal agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and his team who are trying to capture and take him back to prison. Although it is quite possible to watch this movie without seeing the previous 4 there will be some parts that may slip you by as the writers have assumed that, if your coming to see this movie then there is a very strong possibility you have seen at least a couple of the prequels/sequel.<br/><br/>One thing that I was quite surprised about was the lack of actual cars in the storyline. Sure they were involved slightly more than a normal action movie but I was expecting a lot more. There were probably only 2/3 scenes involving racing or car stunts and when the whole movie is supposed to be based around cars I was expecting just that little bit more. If fact in one scene just when you are expecting a good old fashioned drag race, they cut away to reveal the car back in the garage and already won! The action does make up for this though and is fast flowing throughout as they jump from one explosion/fight scene to the next. The casting of Johnson as the bad-ass agent was a stroke of genius with him bringing his former WWE smack talk to the character. He really makes you want to hate him and I especially enjoyed the Johnson Vs. Diesel fight scene as the 2 heavyweights traded blows.<br/><br/>At over 2 hours this is by far the longest in the franchise and although in general the time will pass quickly, they could have easily chopped off a few minutes here and there to stop the risk of it dragging for some people. The acting and script is nothing special and you will have to sit through a fair bit of 'we're doing this for family' talk but that is not what people will come to watch this movie for.<br/><br/>With Neal H. Moritz announcing in March the development of a sixth and seventh movie for the series it is doubtful that this surprisingly long lasting franchise will go away quietly. Despite having lots of good action and successfully filling a void in my day, lets just hope that they return to the core basics for the next one rather than forgetting the main reason for these movies was supposed to be the cars.<br/><br/>For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">This one was too much even for the F&amp;F franchise; I would call McGuiver and Jammy Bond, maybe even Braddock. And many places didn't look like Brazil, which has almost no passenger railways at all (maybe there're three or four, no more than 200 miles I guess), what to say TGV (or something looking like it, I really can't figure what was that). Second, it was more like Mexico, if I know something about that. Finally, I don't know where they found so many import cars for those do exist in very, very limited quantity. And just a dozen (in the entire country) are designated as patrol units, for use of senior officers who aren't seen around driving them. Well, there's no fun in driving a VW Fox or a Fiat with 79HPs, uh?</div>]\n"

            "Review Text: This is the film that single-handedly got me to give the rest of the series a shot, for better or worse. It's a nice change of pace from the previous films where it abandons the street race angle (how far could you have taken that anyway?) and goes into the direction of a heist action flick with cars. Dwayne Johnson is a great addition and really adds to the series embracing the goofiness of its premise. So yeah, still the best this franchise had, and that's kind of rare for a franchise on its fifth film. The action for the most part is really handled well and a lot of fun to watch. The cast as an ensemble are very charismatic which no doubt makes it more fun for audiences to see a cast that has so much diversity and it's not done with generic stereotypes but just a bunch of people with a common interest. Overall a very entertaining action flick.\n",

Which leads to them being hunted by Luke Hobbs Played by Dwayne Johnson who along with Elena Played by Elsa Pataky begin to hunt them down. Also returning are Roman Played by Tyrese Gibson, Tej Played by Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Han Played by Sung Kang, Gisele played by Gal Gadot. Reyes Played by Joaquim de Almeida who serves as the Film Main Antagonist.Story wise the plot is very good because it features the return of many of the characters from the series which is very good and moves the series along. Plus the film requires you to pay attention or you'll miss something. Plus you see the characters grow in this film from the last films.What drives the film like the other films is that the stunts from start to finish that defines The Laws of Physic and why I love this series because the cast and crew are always driven to push the limits and hold nothing back, Fast Five is the example of it.There is just a lot for this film that I recommend seeing for yourself where you'll be amazed and how you can do a sequel with the right minds.With awesome stunts, great action and plot you'll be glad you watch this film.I give Fast Five an 8 out of 10\n",

Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster , Tyrese Gibson , Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang, Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot, Tego Calderon and Don Omar, the gang are all here! They are all cast from the previous installments. \n",
            "The Director brings all new actors in the cast crew: Joaquim de Almeida, Dwayne Johnson and Elsa Pataky. The script, the players, the action scenes, the story. Everything about this film is awesome! This film kicks ass. Is my second favorite best film in the series franchise. This film for me even beats Furious 7. Cause Furious 7 is not that good as this film is. The far of the highest best films ever. It's actually probably my favorite movie that I've ever seen. If you like any of the other fast and furious movies SEE THIS ONE!!!!! It's a Epic movie watch it till all the way to the end.Fast Five picks up, literally, right where Fast & Furious left off. Dom (Vin Diesel) is on his way to prison when his partner, former undercover detective Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), and his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) stage a daring (albeit highly unlikely) prison-bus break. On the run from the police, the FBI and the media, the three hightail it across the border and head even further south, all the way to Rio de Janeiro. There, they decide to lay down, lay low and avoid any unwanted attention. Nah, I'm just kidding. They do what any international fugitives would do: rob a train, double cross a local crime lord named Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) and his right-hand man Zizi (Michael Irby), put themselves on the radar of a ludicrously musclebound U.S. Diplomatic Security Service agent (Dwayne Johnson), and set out to steal untold millions from Reyes. That's right, it's One Last Heist for Dom and Brian. Not that anyone should be foolish enough to think this is the last we'll see of the led-foot duo; not after Fast Five revved up $600 million at the worldwide box office. (Be sure to sit through the first chunk of end credits for a nice little surprise.) Fast Five boasts incredible action scenes that are all varied and equally exciting. The film is full of clean, well choreographed shots that are easy to watch and the cast works great as a whole unit, making the film's running time breeze by. The heist in Rio De Janeiro was amazing An energetic, high-octane. The film was brilliant and smart it was action fun Entertained. The fight scenes between Dwayne Jonson and Vin Diesel was tremendous. I was happy that they put someone (Dwayne Jonson) in the movie that was so smart like Dom (Vin Diesel) was. Luke Hobbs as A Diplomatic Security Service agent to track down Dom and his crew was awesome! He did a brilliant job In this Action packed sequel film! Just Lin deliver us a high octane Action packed story filled with full of cars and shootings in his film.Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Dwayne Johnson lead this all-star all-action movie with outrageous stunts, incredible cars and beautiful girls that pushes the limits into the red and beyond! The legendary Dom Torreto (Vin Diesel) partners with outlaw cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) on the opposite side of the law in exotic Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Hunted by ruthless Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and an army of corrupt cops working for a deadly drug kingpin. Torreto and O'Conner reunite the gang from previous Fast adventures to pull off one last job - an insane heist worth $100 million! \"Five Times The Action!, Five Times the Fury!\" I love this film to death and I love how they were planning to rob a Police Station. The first half was a little boring, but the second half was fast paced entertained filled with action. I love this film and everything about it. I love that it is 2.hrs long so that it can tell the whole story.When developing Fast Five, Universal Studios deliberately departed from the street racing theme prevalent in previous films in the series, to transform the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By doing so, they hoped to attract wider audiences that might otherwise be put off by a heavy emphasis on cars and car culture. Fast Five is considered the transitional film in the series, featuring only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as gun fights, brawls, and the heist of $100 million. The production mounted a comprehensive marketing campaign, marketing the film through social media, virtual games, cinema chains, automobile manufacturers, and at NASCAR races.\n",

            "Review Text: Sure the original was something fresh, new, and somewhat original. But the sequels have been anything but. Yeah i know it's high octane fun, but you can say the same thing about Michael Bay films. Am i saying that these sequels are as bad as Michael Bay films? No, but each one offers nothing new, well, unless you count drifting, and that isn't saying a lot. Hopefull this new installment can bring something fresh to the table.I never thought i would say this, but i actually enjoyed this movie. I went in with low expectations, and came out pretty damn satisfied. Sure the movie had a lot of the same moving parts, but what really made this one stand out is how it actually changed the pace of how they normally do things.First, they didn't have a damn drag race every 10 minutes. In fact, they barely had any. Which really is a genius idea, because when the time did come to have an awesome driving sequence, you were begging for it. Finally, someone with brains stepped into this movie and said let's save all of our bullets and unleash them in the end.So with a series that relies heavily on their driving sequences and less on their script, how do you keep your audience entertained? Well, the first step is to incorporate another major actor, enter The Rock. Next, you really need to buff up your script. Okay, here is where it gets both good and bad. It's good because the movie takes a ton of it's credit from the \"Ocean 11\" films. Yeah, it's stealing an idea, but it injecting more action into it, which is pretty cool. But the reason why i say it's also bad, is because it's still packed with bad cheesy one-liners, poor acting, and some really tarnished plot outlines. But does that take anything away from the fun.......not really.Bottom Line, okay people, here is your first action movie worth seeing this year. No, i am not one of those people who hold these 'Fast and Furious' films on a high pedestal. Not since the first one have i given anything over a decent review. But i can say with confidence that this one is actually worth your hard earned dollar. Sure it's slightly cheesy, packed with impossible action, and sure it steals some plot outlines from other films, but i like i said earlier, it's still fun to watch. So with that being said, the question remains.....is this the best one in the series? I still say no, but this movie comes damn close. Closer that any of the other ones, thats for damn sure. On a time line, this should have followed up the original\n",

            "Review Text: \"Home sweet home\" utters Diesel's beefcake criminal Dom Toretto to Walker's baby-faced ex-cop Brian O'Conner as they sit in Toretto's souped up muscle car ready to race along the streets of Rio de Janeiro. There's more than a hint of irony in this; fans of the Fast franchise will know exactly what Dom means. The sequels spawned from the highly successful first film have been a mixed bag appealing to different tastes. Some have been mildly entertaining in their own way, but the one major issue they've all shared is a lack of recurring characters and follow-on narratives. 2009's Fast & Furious partially rectified that by having the main four from the original movie return, but it's this fifth entry that really starts to bring the whole series together.There's supporting characters from every instalment featured here – Matt Schulze's Vince from number one; Tyrese's big-mouthed Roman and Ludicrous' Tej from 2 Fast 2 Furious; Sung Kang's charismatic Han from Tokyo Drift; and Gal Gadot's sexy Gisele from F&F – with a post-credits cameo to cap it off. Scribe Chris Morgan has obviously done his homework as, in addition to the 'who's who' line-up of co-stars, there are references to the previous movies (and characters that don't appear) and he introduces subplots that help build on earlier story lines. This integration of the Fast universe, along with the marvellously tongue-in-cheek mood, notches up a level of interest not before seen in the car-crazy franchise.After taking a new course with Tokyo Drift, and failing to impress with Fast & Furious, filmmaker Justin Lin has well and truly ignited the series with exciting set pieces and lashings of well placed humour. He still struggles to effectively call the shots when exposition (or mere conversation) is required; however he clearly has a handle on shooting the various fast-paced action scenes. There is a spectacular heist of luxury cars aboard a train (with a marvellously ridiculous denouement); a Bourne-esque free-running chase along roof tops; and a bruising hand-to-hand melee between The Rock and big Vin.Of the major stars, it's Fast newcomer Dwayne Johnson who shines the brightest. His epic bad-ass cop makes Toretto look like an absolute sissy, which is no easy feat. He also boasts many of the film's greatest lines and comes away looking the least corny – something Diesel and Walker are evidently use to by now. The chalk and cheese pairing of the two wannabe action stars brings with it a decent slab of shonky acting. Chrome-domed Diesel is especially silly and unconvincing when required to open his mouth, but he looks good behind the wheel of a car and adds plenty to the unapologetic macho atmosphere.Thanks to Morgan's decent script, Lin's solid grasp on the action and Johnson's tough-as-nails turn, this latest addition to a franchise that appeared to be running on fumes has just stepped on the gas.3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Average, 3 - Good, 4 - Great, 5 - Brilliant)\n",

            "Review Text: The former agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and his girlfriend Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) rescue her brother Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) during the transportation to the prison and they flee to Rio de Janeiro. They rob a car from custody and find that the powerful drug lord Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) has a US$ 100,000.00 in a safe located inside the police station and protected by corrupt policeman. Dominic invites his skilled crew to steal the dirty money and achieve their freedom, moving to a country without extradition to the USA. Meanwhile the tough FBI agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) comes to Brazil with an elite force to arrest Dominic and Brian.\"Fast Five\" is an entertaining action film, with cartoonish shootings and fights and an insane car race that destroys dozens of cars and locations. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Dwayne Johnson are synonym of great action scenes, and is nice to see the gorgeous Jordana Brewster that speaks a perfect Portuguese and Elsa Pataky.For Brazilian and specially \"cariocas\" (natives from Rio de Janeiro), this film is also a comedy with the stereotyped Rio and a great quantity of mistakes. Most of the scenes are shot in Puerto Rico; most of the accent of actors speaking Portuguese are not from Rio but from São Paulo or from native in Spanish; Hernan Reyes is not a Brazilian name and Joaquim de Almeida is an actor from Portugal; there are ridiculous geographical mistakes, like for example, the references to the noble areas of Avenida Atlântica and Leblon. The sequences in the slums are also funny, since the modus operandi of armed drug dealers is totally different, using snipers from the top of the hills and barriers in the accesses to avoid the police and paramilitary forces. An American force would never have jurisdiction in Brazil. Last but not the least, there are many corrupt cops in Brazil, but never in such level. I do not understand why the production has not used Brazilian actors and actresses in supporting roles to giver credibility to the footages with the external landscapes of Rio de Janeiro. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): \"Velozes & Furiosos 5 - Operação Rio\" (\"Fast & Furious 5 – Operation Rio\")\n",

They change the scenery a bit, one-up the carnage and the special effects, add a little seasoning and shake well.The thing that made the Fast and the Furious really good was always the fast cars and the portrayal of the street racer subculture with some crime and action on the side. Unfortunately Fast Five fails to deliver the proved formula - the action is too prominent, and frankly feels ridiculous most of the time. The street racing and the tuner scene are moved to the side to make room for more gunfights and ridiculous action scenes. The plot is predictably weak and while the regular cast makes a good effort of keeping the whole thing afloat, their efforts are undermined by some of the new faces (anyone like wrestling?).The whole thing feels like a meaningless series of action scenes glued together with a few romantic moments meant to tend the female demographic. There is no sense of flow throughout the movie and I never felt part of the action, it was not even remotely believable. I wish I could say that the movie was not really bad, just mediocre but that would be lying. Spare yourself some disappointment and go watch something else.\n",

            "Review Text: 'FAST FIVE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) I was never a big fan of the original 'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS' and thought it was severely over-hyped. With each sequel though I think the franchise has gotten better (although I never saw the third chapter: 'TOKYO DRIFT'). This one (for the first time) brings together key cast members from all of the other films including Vin Diesel (who sat out the second film and only did a cameo in the third), Paul Walker (who was absent from the third film), Jordana Brewster (who missed the second and third films) as well as Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang, Cal Gadot and Tego Calderon (who all co-starred in one or two of the other films). It also adds Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson to the cast and fans finally get to see a long anticipated fight scene between he and Vin Diesel. The film is directed by Justin Lin (who also directed the last two films) and written by Chris Morgan (who wrote the last two films as well). It all adds up to a pretty entertaining action film that should definitely please most fans of the genre as well as fans of the franchise.The film opens directly where the last one left off with former FBI agent turned outlaw Brian O'Conner (Walker) and girlfriend Mia (Brewster) breaking Mia's brother and Brian's buddy and partner in crime Dominic Toretto (Diesel) out of prison, by attacking the prison bus he's on. They then flee to Brazil and due to a botched car heist (where DEA agents are murdered) they're moved to the top of America's most wanted list. The baddest federal agent around, Lucas Hobbs (Johnson), is then put on assignment to track them down. O'Conner and Toretto then decide to pull one last big job on the crooked businessman, Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), who framed them by stealing $100 million of his laundered money. They bring in a team of former associates to help them pull off the heist.The movie is really predictable and the story and character development pretty routine but the action scenes are amazing. The film does drag a little in the middle, during the overlong heist setup part of the film but for the most part it's really fast paced and thrilling. The stunts are some of the best ever performed (probably) and the amount of sheer destruction in the film is astonishing. There are several scenes that seriously push the realm of logic and reality but it's all in good senseless fun. The Rock makes a cool addition to the series and the fight scene between him and Diesel doesn't disappoint. The film is most likely everything you think it's going to be and it delivers exactly what it promises. In that sense it's definitely a success and in my opinion at least a little better than all the others in the franchise (just adding the Rock makes it that much better).Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_pFXcDSfo\n",

            "Title: Noisy entertainment even though it could have done with being tighter and more urgent than it was\n",
            "Review Text: Very early in this film Paul Walker's character is hanging off the side of a speeding train in urgent need to get off before it hits the bridge. Instead of jumping to the ground and hoping he can roll his speed down, he jumps to a speeding car seconds before an explosion and then goes with that car as it flies off a cliff into a several hundred meter drop into a lake. At this point my girlfriend asked how any of that had been easier than just jumping onto the ground considering that hitting water from that height is similar to hitting concrete. I couldn't argue her logic but I did have to explain that her logic and attention to detail have no place in a film franchise that has hit its fifth instalment without ever suggestion that logic or plotting are anywhere near as important as a shot of a young woman's ass and a love of fast cars.And that is the problem with Fast Five that you need to overcome, it will at no point do much with the plot unless it knows it can get from that bit of plotting to the next car, gun or ass scene with minimal effort. It is a summer movie though and the \"Five\" in the title does mean that you should know what you're coming to with it. So I did my best to overlook the plot which is messy and a lacking logic at pretty much every turn – I over look it because I'm happy to surrender logic if the film can give me thrills and action. Mostly the film does, or at least it gives spectacle. Whether it is the foot escape over favela roofs or the ridiculous destruction derby of the robbery itself, the film provides you with a lot to look at and as such it is entertaining as spectacle. Personally I though the whole film could have greatly benefited from being tighter outside of these scenes and needed an injection of actual danger and tension. Instead everything happens and our characters and their cars seem indestructible, which does rather detract from the action because the viewer doesn't really \"care\" or worry about what is going on – it is all about just the spectacle. Although, like I said, it does do this well.Previous films in this series have had terrible effects and some awful CGI cars (that look CGI). I'm sure computer effects were in use here but mostly it doesn't show – specifically the car chases and scenes of destruction are satisfyingly real; again they may be effects but they are very good if they are because you do have the satisfying feel of stunt men working hard in the real world – something so many effects-driven blockbusters forget about now that computers can do so much. Matching the spectacle the cast mostly do what they are required to do by looking great. Paul Walker remains good-looking and has the sparkle in his eye that makes him fun to watch in these film. Alongside him Vin Diesel looks like he is half asleep in the most part and in this film his presence is massively damaged by having to be compared to The Rock. The Rock may not have much to do but he has great presence and a real brutal charm – arms the size of tree-trunks also help his \"character\" but, like I said, it makes Diesel look dull and out-of-shape by comparison (although the dull one is certainly true). Outside of them Brewster is OK despite having little to do, Tyrese brings his mouth but not the homoerotic comedy that he brought to the second film while both Pataky and Gadot have tremendous figures. Ludicrous, Kang and others in the gang appear to be in for fans of the franchise but it gives too many characters to care about – in terms of excitement and making the film tighter, it would have been better with a smaller group and tighter focus.Overall Fast Five is a fun film in a franchise that has seen some poor ones already. It provides spectacle and noise which is all one can ask for – even if I would have loved it to be tighter, more dramatic.\n",

            "Title: Entertainment: Ego Driven Car Races\n",
            "Review Text: Ten years after the inception of the fast car action film phenomenon, Fast Five takes the U.S. box office by storm beginning summer early this year. Director Justin Lin (\"Anapolis\") achieves an opening box office numbers north of 80 mil by amassing all of the franchise's most badass stars including Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Sung Kang, Matt Schulze along with adding the brute power of Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson. As expected, there is no plot or character development what so ever, immediately throwing the audience into the escape of Dominic \"Dom\" Toretto (Diesel) sentenced to twenty-five years in prison, facilitated by ex-cop Brian O'Connor (Walker) and Mia Toretto (Brewster). Following Dom's escape, Brian and Mia seek the help of an old friend, Vincent (Schulze), in Rio de Janeiro undertaking a job to steal three cars from a moving train as they wait for Dom's arrival. The heist goes amiss, however, they learn two things, first, they cannot trust anyone and second this is just the tip of the iceberg of the ticket to their freedom. Dom, Brian and Mia commence the biggest robbery the series has ever seen with a 100 million dollar target from the most corrupt and powerful man in Rio, Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). Needless to say, they call Roman Pearce (Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Han (Sung Kang) among other franchise favorites to evade the clutches of Reyes and U.S. federal agent Luke Hobbs (Johnson).Not many sequels stand up to their first installments, however, after four semi-entertaining sexy action thrillers struggling to create a worthwhile plot, \"Fast Five\" does more than equivocating its predecessors. The film's over the top ridiculous scope leaves very little room for slow boring moments. Instead it is full of pointless action scenes including a five-minute foreseeable faceoff between Diesel and Johnson. The battle of the brawny is accompanied by the battle of the sexy between Jordana Brewster and newcomer Elsa Patakay (local Rio cop Elema Neves). And yes there are ego driven car races.The same reasons that make \"Fast Five\" better than its predecessors make the film the true mess that it is. A completely flawed grandiose plot combined with ridiculously bad acting and Tyrese Gibson's cliché one-liners and Johnson's childish clever phrases such as \"Now give me the veggies\" make the script seem like something a 13 year old thought up while playing Need For Speed with his friends. However, by disregarding plot development and clever writing, \"Fast Five\" has broken through the bonds that have always been holding the series back.In the end, nothing stands in the films way as the writers completely shirk their job letting the cast loose through a labyrinth of explosive fun. All that matters is that \"Fast Five\" is the epitome of a Hollywood moneymaker. It is entertainment.\n",

            "Review Text: I went into this movie expecting the usual; fast cars and hot babes held together with a more than flimsy action-packed story line and Justin Lin seemed to schizophrenically deliver (or did he?). The movie starts with a famously stolen and instantly aggravating \"one last job\" scene, obviously not something any movie goer can believe in this instance because let's face it who finishes a movie series on its fifth? This movie sees the return of all the usual (and previous) F&F characters and same tricks of the trade we have seen Brian and Dom perfect with all the usual so-called tense last minute escapes Hollywood has rinsed dry, yet still this movie does deserve its 7/10 rating.How? Rio and the favelas are beautifully shot, the new characters are refreshing and VERY well casted, the vehicles are awesome, although lacking in their usual \"bling\" quality and the witty humour running through from previous F&F's is a little bonus for fans of the previous movies. Coupled with a sprinkling of nail biting moments and generous helpings of laugh-out-loud moments this testosterone injected movie is no doubt a fun, easy on the mind movie to go and watch.Unfortunately, like all \"fun and easy on the mind\" movies, the simplicity of it all becomes very predictable and the same is true for this movie. The story line, although containing a couple of very interesting screws, is essentially like any other heist movie we've all seen before (you already know the conclusion and you always wonder where they magically get all that military level kit from). The fight scenes have obvious outcomes, the alliances of certain characters are openly questionable and the character of Matt Schulze (Vince) is more pointless than jet skiing in your 15 meter, back garden swimming pool.The UNENDING swarms of mind-blowingly beautiful women and roaring hot cars are haplessly missing in the trial to create a more interesting storyline, which has only lead to needless additions into the story which add nothing to the overall plot. This movie is like a man in his late 20's desperate to become something more yet hold onto his youth and ending up messing up on both fronts. There's a token nitrous moment amidst the scores of needless carnage and overflowing testosterone levels from the tanking cast and developments in Brian and Mia's relationship add nothing to the story.Overall, the movie is enjoyable but lacks the zing of maybe the first two. It falls short of a modern day epic man-movie like the \"expendables\" and clearly lacks the strong storyline and acting prowess of a brilliant modern day heist movie like \"the bank job\". Saying that, it would still be a shame to miss this movie.\n",

            "Review Text: Fast Five - you'd think by the fifth instalment the Fast & Furious franchise would have run out of nos but this film really 'packs a punch'. Think of what you expect from this film, and then make it really amazing! Great chases - all kinds! -, great fist fights (Vin Diesel vs. The Rock..!!), great action sequences.... everything you would want from this film is IN IT and if you suspend all disbelief and go with it, its done brilliantly. Even the cheesy lines and plot twists become enjoyable.Not sure I'd pay a full adult weekend cinema price to see it, but if you can get 241 or a student discount, definitely see it on the big screen! Or wait for the blu-ray. Either way, you won't regret it when you see the beads of sweat running off The Rock's huge, bald head. Weird.\n",

            "Review Text: The latest in the Fast and Furious franchise has recently hit the screens and what with the others being a good way to spend a few hours I was hoping for a similar type of movie from this one with plenty of great cars and car chases to boot.Set after Fast & Furious (No. 4) but before The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (No. 3), this time the action is played out in Rio, Brazil after Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) has escaped from police custody in the US with help from his old pal Brian (Paul Walker) and sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) and gone into hiding. With them needing money to disappear forever, Dom hatches a plan to steal all the money from Rio's most reputable underworld kingpin Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida).At the same time they are being hunted down by the elite federal agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and his team who are trying to capture and take him back to prison. Although it is quite possible to watch this movie without seeing the previous 4 there will be some parts that may slip you by as the writers have assumed that, if your coming to see this movie then there is a very strong possibility you have seen at least a couple of the prequels/sequel.One thing that I was quite surprised about was the lack of actual cars in the storyline. Sure they were involved slightly more than a normal action movie but I was expecting a lot more. There were probably only 2/3 scenes involving racing or car stunts and when the whole movie is supposed to be based around cars I was expecting just that little bit more. If fact in one scene just when you are expecting a good old fashioned drag race, they cut away to reveal the car back in the garage and already won! The action does make up for this though and is fast flowing throughout as they jump from one explosion/fight scene to the next. The casting of Johnson as the bad-ass agent was a stroke of genius with him bringing his former WWE smack talk to the character. He really makes you want to hate him and I especially enjoyed the Johnson Vs. Diesel fight scene as the 2 heavyweights traded blows.At over 2 hours this is by far the longest in the franchise and although in general the time will pass quickly, they could have easily chopped off a few minutes here and there to stop the risk of it dragging for some people. The acting and script is nothing special and you will have to sit through a fair bit of 'we're doing this for family' talk but that is not what people will come to watch this movie for.With Neal H. Moritz announcing in March the development of a sixth and seventh movie for the series it is doubtful that this surprisingly long lasting franchise will go away quietly. Despite having lots of good action and successfully filling a void in my day, lets just hope that they return to the core basics for the next one rather than forgetting the main reason for these movies was supposed to be the cars.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com\n",

            "Review Text: Okay, you chase down a speeding train in a rickety tractor rig, bumping along on desert terrain. You pull up to the speeding train, matching its exact speed, as you deftly cut the entire side of the box car with a blow torch. You hop in and deftly park a Ford GT onto the tractor rig not once, but twice. Then you drive a Corvette Stingray off the speeding train; the car crashing 15 feet onto the bumpy desert terrain off a speeding train and it causes no more damage than a small pothole. You speed the Corvette down bumpy desert terrain and are headed straight for the steel girder of a bridge spanning a 500 ft. deep gorge as a guy jumps off a train onto the car at the last split second.The girder apparently moved out of the way. You jump from the car as it hurtles downward off the cliff towards the water; a much longer plunge than from the Golden Gate Bridge and you pop up from the water, unscathed, as if you had just dove into a pool. You're then strung up suspended by chains in a warehouse but simply snap out of the chains just before the bad guys torture you and escape....All this happens after a speeding prison bus collides with a black Accura sports car..and the car wins! The car is undamaged as the bus rolls a dozen times and lands upside down with none of the handcuffed prisoners having been killed...and did the Rock take acting lessons from OJ?...This film is unconscionable garbage and is not worth watching.\n",

            "[<div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">I don't think many other franchises has been as turbulent and uneven as The Fast and the Furious films. Things started off pretty earnestly with Rob Cohen's first film, but quickly careened into odd directions, with the ever-cheesy 2 Fast 2 Furious taking off and running with one main character while leaving the other in the dust, and with Tokyo Drift drifting away with totally different characters altogether. Thankfully, Fast &amp; Furious realigned the series with its roots. But it wasn't until Fast Five when I really began to give a darn about this series. Granted that all films have had their fun moments, the fifth film magically tied in every single strand from every single film, and made every single character relevant. Best of all, it did so with a great sense of fun: it had great pacing, amusing comedy, great action, and it made the characters stand out as a collectively outstanding cast.<br/><br/>So now Fast &amp; Furious 6 has come out, reuniting the entire gang once more to take on bigger stakes. The spectacle in this film tries its best to be even bigger, more absurd, and more awesome than before: the film is effectively book-ended with two massive action setpieces. The first involves a decently destructive car chase in London, where the villain effectively uses his custom-built ride to launch other cars all over the place. The film's final act features a really crazy sequence in which a tank roars across a highway, crushing other cars and blowing up bridges. This all culminates with all the muscle cars banding together to bring down a massive cargo plane in a fiery blaze of glory. In between, the film slows down a bit, but there's frequent fist-fights and pursuits, a few scenes of witty comedy, and there's one decent car-racing scene.<br/><br/>Whether or not you really dig this film may depend on how well you dig the characters and all their dynamics. It definitely helps to watch and understand the events of the first five films, because at this point, they've all been through so much and changed so much; for a late-comer like me, who never was invested in the characters until the last film, it can be confusing to remember who was who and what their history was. Fortunately, the film does insert some flashbacks and reminders for the audience's benefit. If you are keeping up with things, then the film will reward you with a cast of endearing and heartfelt characters, and the film's plot generally revolves around their continuing struggles. As far as the actual plot goes, it's pretty brainless and absurd action-movie fodder, and there are plot holes to be found. However, the film does have the merit of presenting a cast of villains to directly oppose the cast of heroes, and the story pulls out a few surprising twists.<br/><br/>The film generally looks good, but many of the action scenes are hectically shot and edited, and it can be hard to tell what's going on in certain scenes. What you can see is awesome, but sometimes, it's just aggravating. Acting is generally fun and enjoyable from the whole cast. Writing gets the job done well enough. This production uses a plethora of quality sets, props, and costumes, with loads of flashy cars at its disposal, and some okay-looking special effects. This film uses some cool hip rap and techno music, while the music score is pretty cool (sounds a lot like Brian Tyler's work from Tokyo Drift, which was one of my favorite soundtracks).<br/><br/>Best recommended to fans of the series, especially if you've been following the last few movies.<br/><br/>4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Well, this was unexpected! Going into this film I found myself with no hype at all. I expected a good, fun and cheesy movie time and I came out of the theater happy and surprised. While this isn't a masterpiece of filmmaking it does achieve what it sets out to do. To entertain you. And it does this quite good and sometimes it goes further than this by showing us some amazing set pieces and action sequences. For example one car, tank chase sequence! This is achieved by the gigantic production value of the film. You can literally smell the money that comes out of these guys. The whole movie you have this sense of scale, and I mean BIG scale! The amazing sound mixing and design including the music pumps you up and puts you in the mood! While the acting isn't Oscar worthy it is very fluid and it doesn't always feel forced. The chemistry between the cast is very solid and credible. Diesel and \"The Rock\" where pretty solid along with the secondary characters, and the villain was surprisingly tolerable. Another thing that solidifies the movie are the effects. These are outstanding along with the camera-work! The things that brought the movie down for me a little bit where some of the stunts, and weirdly some of these I found pretty amazing but although I understand this movie isn't supposed to be taken seriously there were some stunts that were just plain unbelievable, specially in the third act of the movie. And finally, the plot. While not groundbreaking it did have its interesting points but it doesn't drift away from the cheese factors. Overall I was quite surprised by what this movie did and how the director and producers exploited and used their huge production value. This is an example of a good quality action flick.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">The sixth instalment in The Fast and the Furious franchise, Fast &amp; Furious 6 follows into the footsteps of its predecessor and continues the series' new-found mantra of departing from its original street racing theme to move further into the heist thriller sub-genre. And even if it's not as refreshing &amp; impressive as Fast Five, it nonetheless succeeds as another thrilling, ridiculously entertaining &amp; undeniably fun extravaganza.<br/><br/>The story of Fast &amp; Furious 6 concerns Dominic Toretto &amp; his crew, all of whom have retired to a comfortable life following the heist they pulled off in the previous chapter yet they still remain wanted fugitives in their homeland. But when Hobbs asks for their services to take down a skilled mercenary organisation in exchange for clearing their criminal records, Dom accepts the deal and reassembles his team to finish one last job.<br/><br/>Directed by Justin Lin, Fast &amp; Furious 6 is his final stint with this franchise and he decides to go out on a high note by delivering a picture that's far too enjoyable to worry about the laws of physics being bent here on few occasions. The screenplay packs in an interesting plot filled with excellent use of humour but it isn't as tightly gripped as the last instalment and is a slight step down in comparison. But a few elements do get an upgrade.<br/><br/>The technical aspects follow the same formula that was applied in Fast Five and there isn't much to complain here for the set pieces look spectacularly detailed, the action sequences benefit a lot from its energetic camera-work, brilliant editing &amp; more use of practical effects just like the last chapter although at times the action goes way too over-the-top yet not so exaggerated for most viewers to suspend disbelief. And the background score is fitting for the most part.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the entire main cast that was present in the last one reprises its role, Michelle Rodrigues also returns to join the gang and Luke Evans is the new addition who plays this chapter's antagonist. Vin Diesel &amp; Paul Walker do their usual best as Toretto &amp; O'Conner, Dwayne Johnson continues to impress as Hobbs, However, Evans doesn't get enough screen time to show his mettle and his characters turns out to be a generic villain. The rest of the cast chips in with fine contributions.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Fast &amp; Furious 6 builds upon the very ingredients that worked in favour of Fast Five and, barring a couple of issues, manages to stay on the track for the most part. Although not as amazing as the previous entry, this is nevertheless an immensely enjoyable blockbuster material that promises a lot of fun &amp; thrills, and effectively delivers it. Definitely more style than substance although the margin isn't as vast as it had been in the first four chapters of this franchise, Fast &amp; Furious 6 comes delightfully recommended.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">While most franchises lose their steam with each succeeding sequel, the Fast and the Furious franchise is that rare exception where its later films breathe in new life into the series. Once a franchise about car racing, \"Fast Five\" took an unexpected turn as a bank heist thriller in the vein of Steven Soderbergh's \"Ocean's 11,\" a welcomed change as seen by its huge box office earnings and critical success. Now, \"Furious 6\" is neither about car racing nor bank heists, but rather a terrorist threat with obvious inspirations from \"The Dark Knight.\" Like \"Fast Five,\" the results are immensely satisfying and undeniably entertaining.<br/><br/>The key to the franchise's upward turn in quality is due to director Justin Lin. He is a skilled action director, and many filmmakers can learn a few things or two from him: The action sequences are impressive, engaging, comprehensible, and well-shot, with practical effects to boot. There is a sense of danger, verve, and life in these scenes rarely found in other films, despite how over-the-top and ridiculous they may be; and yes, they often drift into gratify-defying territory. While I usually don't react out loudly when watching a film, this film had me gasping, jaw dropping, laughing, and applauding, sometimes all at once!<br/><br/>Another ingredient to the film's success is the chemistry between the cast members. We have grown to love these characters over the course of the series that one cannot help but cheer on for them. In particular, Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous have such a terrific rapport with each other that they provide some of the film's biggest laughs and memorable one-liners. Additionally, Luke Evans is definitely a step up above the previous film's antagonist, and Gina Carano provides some great ass-kicking moments, although not much performance-wise. On another note, I want to mention how refreshing it is to see minority actors fill these roles. Certainly, the film's use of a diverse ensemble cast should be commended. As for the story, it's nothing special, but I dare you not to act surprised when several plot twists are revealed; I did so more than I would like to admit.<br/><br/>If there's one thing to learn about this franchise, it's that some change can be a good thing. While the later sequels do focus away from the car racing, they still featured cars, which helped retain old fans while bringing in new ones. \"Furious 6\" is terrific entertainment, and judging by yet another dazzling cliffhanger and the audience's reaction, \"Fast &amp; Furious 7\" will be an amazing finale for the series. Unfortunately, Justin Lin won't be back around for the last installment, but someone please get this man to direct every and all upcoming action flicks.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Bigger, faster, crazier — that's the motto of the \"Fast &amp; Furious\" franchise six films in. If you thought the action, scale and stunts were off the charts in \"Fast Five,\" prepare to have your mind blown by \"Fast &amp; Furious 6.\" <br/><br/>The previous films were an acceleration, and the series hit full throttle with \"Fast Five.\" The road was open and endless for Universal, and returning writer Chris Morgan and director Justin Lin. What they opt to do in \"F&amp;F6\" is bend the limits of reality to their will. From the initial London chase to a highway tank sequence to the grand finale, which involves a massive cargo plane, this is an action movie jacked up on steroids. In fact, there are a couple references to Marvel \"Avengers\" characters — a not-so-subliminal suggestion that Universal would like you to think of Dominic Toretto's crew/family as a team of superheroes.<br/><br/>The trouble is for every \"wow!\" moment there are twice the number of \"what?\" moments. The action is so ludicrous that you lose all sense of what's happening. They're like little blackout moments as you drink more and more of the movie's high-octane Kool-Aid.<br/><br/>Morgan pulls together a perfectly viable plot. Dom's (Vin Diesel) presumed deceased former lover, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) has been spotted in association with a criminal mastermind named Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) whose ex-military crew is essentially the shadow image of our heroes. Dobbs (Dwayne Johnson) presents this info to Dom in hopes that it'll persuade Dom into doing him favor in taking Shaw down. It naturally works, and the crew must put a hiatus on their quiet life spending all the cash they stole in the last film; when the patriarch of the family calls, you answer.<br/><br/>The movie doubles down on the notion of the crew as family. Shaw is supposed to be the antithesis. He doesn't care about allegiances but about precision and planning. He's cold and calculated, whereas the \"family\" is warm and spontaneous. It's cliché, but at least time is spent on the characters. There is only one newbie in former MMA fighter Gina Carano as Hobbs' new right hand, meaning the character time is invested in the existing characters, which is good, though the script doesn't pierce beyond the surface traits we're already familiar with.<br/><br/>It also bears mentioning that at one point the script reveals a twist that's solely for the purpose of a twist. This \"surprise\" makes no sense and has no actual bearing on what happens in the film. Morgan wanted a surprise moment to keep things interesting and it's a nice moment — but then you realize it's actually meaningless and changes nothing. Another example of how flash without substance is the M.O. of this series. You have to like flash for the sake of flash to be a big fan.<br/><br/>Of course any scene in which an engine of any kind is not running only matters so much in these films, but \"Fast &amp; Furious 6\" will start to really separate out the pure action junkies who've been hooked on this series from those who prefer some plausibility and gravity —literally and figuratively — in their blockbusters. Lin's sensibilities would probably be of more use in a sci-fi or fantasy movie where he could break all laws of common sense and completely get away with it. In this movie, depending on your taste, it will either get you stoked or spoil the moment.<br/><br/>One could argue that this franchise has found a niche in larger-than-life action movies — that there's a viable space for films that maintain the trappings of the real world but play by the rules of a superhero movie. That's fair, but in many ways by blowing the ceiling off what's possible, they've created another ceiling. If anything is possible, at some point we will no longer be surprised by the impossible. The films would be better served by maintaining some thread of connection to the laws of physics, then when they broke them a little, it would have a bigger impact. \"Fast Five\" did this well and it's a shame this movie takes such a tremendous leap in believability.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, there's an undeniable adrenaline rush that comes with Lin's style of direction and the size and stature of the stunts and action sequences. It's three-fold true in this entry. That's the kind of thrill that maintains a sufficient baseline for enjoying these moves.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Fast &amp; Furious over the last few installments has become all about action. And the latest outing takes it a step further. Almost 20% of the movie is comprised of action sequences. And at the expense of action, plot, writing, characters all take a backseat. But no one's complaining. Why ? Because the action makes up for all of it.<br/><br/>Do the above statements sound cliché ??? The movie's plot is full of such silly dialogs so its best ignored in the current context. What works is the action - Lin and his crew bring us some of the most ridiculously outrageous and boldly conceived action sequences. There's an intense chase through London in the initial reels and also a race later on. There's a whole plane take-off-crash sequence towards the end that you've probably got a glimpse of in the trailers. The girls are no slouches either and we see an intense hand-to-hand fight of sorts between Michelle Rodriguez's Letty and Gina Carano's Riley.<br/><br/>But the movie's best sequence is undoubtedly the 10 minute Tank chase across the freeway that involves most of the cast and culminates in a breathtaking \"catch\" (about which I'd not say any further). The camera cuts like crazy, music is pulsating and that single sequence is probably worth the price of the movie ticket.<br/><br/>Apart from action, Furious 6 doesn't have much going for it. Dialog is standard, at times even silly and predictable, characters are flat, performances are decent. The car chases and night scenes got me so involved, I actually felt a bit strange leaving the theater and coming out into the real world's broad daylight. And the post-credits scene is simply, a treat which makes the next installment in the series worth looking forward to. Suffice it to say that in the end, the movie drifts full circle.<br/><br/>Watch it for the action, and for the action alone. If you expect any sort of character development or family issues like the first installment had, you'll be disappointed. Else, you're in for one hell of a ride.<br/><br/>Score: 7 / 10</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Fast &amp; Furious 6 (2013) is the best of the best Action film in the series franchise! It's Justin Lin's Masterpiece and I love it to death. Sorry but is not Fast Five and Furious 7 the best, but is Fast &amp; Furious 6 the best one in the franchise! This my favorite best film of the franchise that I just love to death! The film has great cast and great action, great dialogue! It is the last time that Paul Walker starts in this film. In Furious 7 was his brother who was portraying Brian O'Conner with a fake CGI. In here Paul Walker is real, Justin Lin started a great franchise which ended in this film.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson reunite for this sixth installment in the 'Fast and Furious' action thriller franchise, directed by Justin Lin. After their lucrative Rio heist, and unable to return home, Dom (Vin Diesel) and the rest of his compatriots are forced to kill time lying low in different locations around the world. When DSS agent Hobbs offers Dom and his crew full pardons in return for taking down Owen Shaw (Luke Evans)'s gang of mercenary drivers, the offer seems too good to pass. But as the rivals head for a showdown on the streets of London, Dom learns that Shaw's second-in-command is none other than his presumed dead former lover, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez).<br/><br/>I love This film to death! This film is about rescuing Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and stopping a brilliant mastermind terrorist hijacker Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) and his team of hijackers.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson and Michelle Rodriguez lead a cast of returning all-stars as the global blockbuster franchise built on speed delivers the biggest adrenaline rush yet in this explosive Action Film. Hobbs (Johnson) has been tracking an organization of lethally skilled drivers, whose mastermind (Luke Evans) is aided by the love Dom (Diesel) thought was dead, Letty (Rodriguez). The only way to stop the criminal mercenaries from stealing a top secret weapon is to outmatch them at street level, so Hobbs asks for the help of Dom and his elite team. Payment for the ultimate chase? Full pardons for all of them and a chance to make their families whole again.<br/><br/>The \"Fast &amp; Furious\" franchise has always been a personal favorite of mine. Sure, as a whole, they're fairly easy to pass off as mindless action films for film goers who want a good rush of big-budget Hollywood action, but I've mostly seen them as more of a chugging train of car movies that simply get better with each new installment, and that's no exception with \"Fast &amp; Furious 6,\" which I'd probably say is the best addition to the series so far. I don't think I've been this thoroughly entertained by an action sequel in a while. The car chases and stunts are bigger, wilder, and more over-the-top than ever before, the characters' previously limited personalities continue to grow quite impressively, and the story manages to be both awesomely ridiculous and surprisingly engaging from start to finish (even though we all know which side is gonna come out victorious in the end). <br/><br/>The action is glorious while it lasts, but then the film goes back to figuring out how to keep its over sized vessel from taking on water. And that's more hard work than it's worth.<br/><br/>Still, the best thing about this flick is the character interaction, even with actors whose roles are this limited. Letty's amnesia adds an interesting soapy twist to the plot that forces Dom to constantly try to remind her why she loves him. Brian's fatherhood also lets Paul Walker do a bit of enjoyably self-serious acting of his own. Otherwise, Tyrese Gibson and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges are left with the snappy comedic relief, while Gina Carano, Gal Gadot, and Elas Pataky merely get to look feisty and hot in their action scenes (but at least they do a great job at it). As for Dwayne Johnson, he gives an unusually deadpan performance this time around, with only just a few outrageous outbursts of manly banter here and there. Nonetheless, the cast here is consistently entertaining, with the screenplay letting everyone get a chance to shine, even if some of them aren't quite as memorable as others. The script delivered an action moments with high explosions on an airplane that are not forgettable. I love that fight between Gina Carano &amp; Michelle Rodriguez which it was tremendous. <br/><br/>I love this film to death! I love this film to death, Fast &amp; Furious 6 is the best! The battles on airplane are Epic! I consider it as Justin Lin's Masterpiece.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">The faster the cars in this franchise seem to go, the more realism seems to go away with it. Sure, the action and car chases in \"Fast &amp; Furious 6\" is breathtaking and spectacular, but the movie was just a tad over the top.<br/><br/>I sat down to watch \"Fast &amp; Furious 6\" simply because I had the opportunity, and because I wanted to watch it because of Michelle Rodriguez. I can't say that I had any particular hopes or expectations to this movie, nor can I claim that it was a movie release that I was in any way looking forward to.<br/><br/>If you have seen any of the previous five movies then you know exactly what you will get here. There is nothing much new to be had here, it is essentially the same. However, that being said, then the movie is enjoyable, entertaining and fast-paced.<br/><br/>This sixth installment to the franchise brings the return of an assumed dead member of the Toretto 'family' and it also brings the departure of one. The returning member is, of course, Letty. I am not going to reveal who will be departing - you'll just have to watch the movie for yourself and find out.<br/><br/>As entertaining as the action was in the movie, then the last whole segment was a bit too much. I mean, a car bring down a massive Russian cargo airplane? That was just too much. And how long does it take for a plane of that size to get enough speed to become airborne? It just took forever. And speaking of forever, then that tarmac runway had to be the longest in the world - it just went on and on.<br/><br/>As with the previous movies, then it is a great ensemble of actors and actresses, and it is as always a joy to have them returning to their parts, and there is a great chemistry between the various characters. I was especially thrilled to see Joe Taslim (playing Jah) in the movie; he did a great job in \"The Raid: Redemption\" and its great to see him make it into American cinema as well. He is definitely a guy to keep an eye on in the future.<br/><br/>\"Fast &amp; Furious 6\" is, as the previous five movies, a guy's movie - full of adrenaline, muscle cars, car chases, macho guys and testosterone dripping off everywhere. The story was enjoyable, even with the part that went off the scale. And if you enjoyed any of the previous movies, then you definitely want to watch \"Fast &amp; Furious 6\" as well.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Mixed emotions his the viewer seeing FAST AND FURIOUS 6 for the first time knowing that Paul Walker is gone and wondering what will happen with the in process Fast and Furious 7. But in ways that fact makes this movie more treasured. It is a whoop-'em up fast action packed film that takes your breath away with the wild car chases and one the ground derring- do. Writer Chris Morgan and director Justin Lin have this medium down to a predictable but fine science.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly simple (as usual) allowing the telling of the story to be more important than any big philosophical notions. Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson, with even larger biceps varices!) has Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) reassemble their crew (Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Sung Kang) in order to take down mastermind Shaw (Luke Evans) who commands an organization of mercenary drivers across 12 countries. Payment? Full pardons for them all. The big driver is to 'rescue' Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who seems to be with Shaw's group after suffering amnesia, back into their fold. Wild situations abound and they are as exciting as ever – if not more so!<br/><br/>Definitely worth watching even for those who are not long term F &amp; F fans. It is a terrific action film with sparkling actors having a great time. Grady Harp December 13</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">The Fast and Furious franchise has undergone a radical transformation since launching 12 years ago, with the changes following Justin Lin taking hold of directorial duties from Tokyo Drift (film three) onwards.<br/><br/>The series has made the transition from street races to include drugs, heists, and now terrorism, while lead characters Dom Toretto (Diesel) and Brian O'Conner (Walker) have gone from petty thug and law enforcer to wanted fugitives.<br/><br/>With an opening sequence reminiscent of Quantum of Solace, Toretto and Brian screech around mountaintops as the latter readies himself to become a father, demonstrating how adult and family-minded they've become. Meanwhile, what follows is a nice refresher for those acquainted with the series and for newcomers alike, acting as a highlights reel to bring everyone up to speed of the events experienced in the previous five films.<br/><br/>The antagonist for Fast 6 is Mr Owen Shaw (Evans), a former special ops military man that uses his knowledge, contacts and fast cars to make robberies for the highest bidder. In this instance, it just so happens he has his eyes on a chip that would incite terrorism in the wrong hands, which prompts baby oil-loving federal agent Hobbs (Johnson) to round up Toretto and his crew for back-up, offering them full pardons in exchange for their services.<br/><br/>London is the main backdrop for the film, which, naturally, features a very corny cameo, though the the bright lights, black taxis and double-decker buses dotted around the city are infinitely more welcome.<br/><br/>For me, five was the best of all of the films, but six gives it a run for its money, taking the stunts to ridiculous new heights (literally). You could, of course, reprimand the film for its use of impossible feats, but that's the whole point of these films, right? To get bigger and more extreme, as demonstrated with the big and extreme – and always affable – introduction of Johnson in Fast Five.<br/><br/>For me, Johnson changed the game and breathed new life into a franchise that was beginning to get stale, and seeing Hobbs join forces with Toretto and co makes for brilliant viewing. The action is insane and the banter is electric, with the camaraderie between the cast obvious.<br/><br/>The only criticism of the film is its length. There was a particular moment that seemed as though the film had wrapped, though it continued for another half hour, and while what followed was laced with adrenaline and big bangs, the film could have done with a 20 minute tightening.<br/><br/>Shaw isn't an intimidating or imposing character, particularly when facing off against Hobbs and Toretto, but he is devious, ruthless and sharp, presenting an entirely new threat to the series.<br/><br/>Those in the know will be aware Tokyo Drift threw the timeline entirely out of sequence, but the game comes full circle at the end of the film, and you won't want to miss the credits sequence that follows <br/><br/>Originally posted at www.zentertainmentweekly.com<br/><br/>7/10</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">I still can't believe I am giving a 9.0 to a film that is #6 in a brainless action franchise!<br/><br/>I am not aware of any other franchise (except maybe, strangely enough, f13) where #6 is the best of the series. Normally the energy, creativity are gone by then.<br/><br/>Not this time.<br/><br/>I simply cannot believe how much I enjoyed every single minute of this film!<br/><br/>There was even a decent plot!! (hey, for a film that is basically made up of fast cars, explosions and fight scenes, that says a lot!)<br/><br/>However, I won't go into the plot - because there are some REAL twists in it, and it is better to go in with a fresh mind.<br/><br/>It does help if you have seen the prior 5, but no sweat if you haven't. <br/><br/>What really pleasantly surprised me was how funny this film was!! I would say about 1/2 the film was gut splitting comedy. It is rare that most jokes work in a film. Usually some fall flat. Not in this one! every single joke worked. I laughed so hard that I know I missed some!<br/><br/>This is really meant to be seen on the big screen with a large crowd. I can't remember the last time so many people laughed, went 'WHOA!\" and \"yeah\" even clapping during a film!<br/><br/>The film starts off with a bang and ends with a post-ending that will make you grin from ear to ear.<br/><br/>The film deals with criminals who are obsessed with fast cars and like to create mayhem with their cars.<br/><br/>Wall to wall action, comedy with just the right amount of drama and love interest.<br/><br/>This could be \"the\" measurement for the brainless-feel-good-summer- action film.<br/><br/>The only reason I am not giving this a 10.0 is because 1) it was a little long.. the final scene was almost a movie in itself (but it was a hoot!), and 2) in general I don't think any film is perfect. In some scenes (thankfully only a few) there were too many close ups that made it a little hard to follow the action. But I am really nitpicking here, folks.<br/><br/>If you like action, fast cars, explosions, comedy....<br/><br/>run, don't walk to see F&amp;F 6.<br/><br/>(and this from a guy who has the Seventh Seal and Alexander Nevsky in his DVD collection)</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">As the Fast &amp; Furious franchise continues with it's simple enjoyments of fast cars, well oiled muscles and sexy ladies. This film does meet expectations, and is your typical faster and bigger sequel. <br/><br/>This time the story follows Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and the gang. Who are this time not being chased but being recruited by Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson). To bring down international criminal Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) who is aided by once thought of dead Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez).<br/><br/>What is good about the film is Director's, Justin Lin's decision to keep the film in a action-oriented direction. With a slight nods to it's street racing past. But focusing on 80's big muscle, big explosions nostalgia. Also the continuing use of practical effects over CGI backgrounds and locations. Make the film look all the more impressive. The action is over the top and a little silly but i did very much enjoy it. The only poor bit being a moment where Vin Diesel's character saves someone life taking the ridiculousness a bit to far. <br/><br/>With the ever expanding cast the writers i imagine do have their work cut out for them. But everyone in the film except Jordana Brewster who again is given the short shrift do get their moments. But some of the comedy does miss it's mark, and the return of Letty is given the thinnest and quite unoriginal of explanations for her return. Also because of the huge cast of good guys, there is a lack of development for the villains. Making it difficult for Luke Evans who is actually very good in his role, to make a strong impression and did not become the threat to the team as much as he should of. <br/><br/>This is a fun film, so just turn off your brain and enjoy the ride and be prepared for a very decent post credit sequence hopefully setting up a possibly very exciting Fast 7.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">The previous installments of this franchise (specifically 1,2, Tokyo Drift and 4) was all about racing, sure there's a plot but it wasn't really shown well, then part 5 happened and the franchise took a different turn, it now became a heist film instead of the usual racing. I hated and I loved this turn of the franchise, I hated it because in part 5, the racing competition aspect of the film is gone, it became chases but I also loved this turn because it made the franchise take a different approach. My question is, will this formula still work with part 6? Find out below.<br/><br/>Story: The story in this movie picks up after the previous one where it was known that 'Letty' (Michelle Rodriguez) was still alive and I admit that they handled her \"resurrection\" quite well but that is only the sub-plot of this movie. The main plot is Hobbs (The Rock) is chasing after Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). He then gets the help of Toretto and Brian's crew by using Letty as bait (or that's how I see it). The story is pretty simple and they told it without adding anymore sub plot but some of the sub plots that were made felt very crowded to the story even though it was solved. It just felt a little heavy and a bit too much for the movie.<br/><br/>Acting: If you saw the previous installments from this franchise well then you ain't missing anything from their performance, it's pretty much the same but I have to say this though, Vin Diesel and The Rock displays pure bad-assery in this movie. That being said, I will give my two cents on the two characters from this movie which are Gina Carano who played Riley and Luke Evans who is Owen Shaw. Carano was able to hold her own despite having little dialogue and what makes her character seems badass is because of her action scene, this is actually one of the things I'm looking forward to upon seeing this movie because I loved her in 'Haywire' (awesome film, check it out) and I;m confident to say that I am not disappointed with her on this one. Next is Luke Evans, he IMO is one the versatile actors in the industry today, you can cast him in almost any role and he displays a good performance. In here is the main villain although he gave a good performance in this role I find it hard to find him as an effective villain, there is something missing with his performance here I'm just not sure what it is.<br/><br/>Action: The Fast franchise is definitely known for having one of the best car chases ever and this one doesn't disappoint and it does not only have car chases but also fist fights, head bangin' and other sh*t. Even though some of the action scene were very over the top it was still entertaining and was handled pretty well. The action was not violent or brutal as it showed little to no blood and being a fan of R-13 I can say that this rating does not fit well to the style of FF and I'm happy and contented with it's PG-13 rating. IMO this is the most action-packed FF film so far.<br/><br/>Cinematography: The cinematographer did a wonderful job here, the shots were just amazing and adds depth to the mood that is set within each scene. The shots were able to show scenery that really captures the beauty of the set and like I said the mood of the scene.<br/><br/>Direction: I wasn't much of a fan of Lin's direction here, it was pretty slow which made the film a little boring for me despite having heavy action. Even though the movie is a little slow paced, Lin was able to tell the story with it's whole heart. I liked how he did the pacing in FF 5 though.<br/><br/>Overall: 'Fast and Furious 6' was high-octane action movie injected with some humor. Using the same formula as the previous one made this film good and also bringing back the racing aspect of the original FF films. While I consider the FF 5 is still the best one in the franchise, I can still say that this is one solid addition to it. I give this movie a 3.5/5<br/><br/>P.S. Watch the post-credit scene, it made me get hyped for Fast and Furious 7.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Part 6 does not disappoint. More action then ever. If you added Bruce Willis this could have been Die Hard 6</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">I'm going to keep this short, simple and sweet because that is exactly what this film is. It's great summer fun for all ages that manages to succeed on the one thing I hate in horror movies; make an idiot of itself. It is where this stupidity in plot events comes from that gives the film its fuel to do nothing but provide brainless over-the-top popcorn fun. It is done so by having some of the best sound editing I have heard in a while with brilliantly paced action sequences, with one fight scene in particular that will surly be the best action scene of the year. I recommend Furious 6 if you're looking to have some fun, but whatever you do, do not walk in there expecting The King's Speech, because it is not what this movie is trying to be- which makes this film so admirable.<br/><br/>Grade: B+</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">I went to the cinema with quite low expectations due to the trailer. However after watching this film i was amazed by the outcome. There was so much thrilling tense action, at one point i was on the edge of my seat. The fights and the car chases were magnificent. The series seems to be getting better and better. Fast and furious 6 is by far the best one, and i can't wait for number 7. There was so much going on and the ending was awesome. I will definitely buy this on DVD when it comes out. Great acting from the casts. This is the most entertaining film of 2013 so far. There was epic cars, sexy girls and brilliant locations.<br/><br/>10/10</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Another awesome installment to the franchise! Fast &amp; Furious 6 is actually better than its predecessor! It has great characters, humor, action and of course sexy cars/women!</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">The Fast and the Furious franchise has never been known for an engrossing story. No one goes to the movies to see character development and a complicated storyline. They go for the cars, the girls, and the explosions, and this installment has all of the above, including a fair story.<br/><br/>A ghost from Dom's past, Letty, has come back from the dead, and Dom reunites the team from Fast Five (a team that works on all levels) in order to get her back. Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson provide some of the humor of the film, with their bantering back and forth throughout, but I found that the theater I was in laughed and cheered throughout the course of the movie. The action is good, and never lets up. For a film that is over two hours, I found myself only checking the time when I thought the finale was happening (to see how long it would be).<br/><br/>What you want in this film is something as good as Fast Five. Something original and fresh. What you get is something that improves on Fast Five (and the rest of the series) on all levels. This is by far the best Fast and Furious movie ever, and it really shows how a series like this can turn around from something as bad as Tokyo Drift.<br/><br/>And it has a nice set up for Fast &amp; Furious 7 during the credits, where we get a little surprise for the villain of the next film.<br/><br/>Bravo, this film is awesome, and should be viewed by fans of both the series and of action movies in general.<br/><br/>8/10</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Really, how many franchises can claim to be at their best the sixth time round? But that is exactly where the 'Fast and Furious' team are at with this exercise in pure exhilaration. Just when we feared that it might be difficult to top the jaw-dropping finale in 'Fast Five', director Justin Lin proves that he has reserved his best one yet for what has been announced as his final outing at the helm after four consecutive runs.<br/><br/>Continuing what began as an invigorating transition from streetcar racing to heist film the last time round, resident scribe Chris Morgan ups the stakes by pitting our favourite anti-heroes against their most dangerous opponent yet. That man is Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), an ex-SAS officer turned mercenary who leads a nefarious gang of criminals bent on stealing the components capable of assembling a lethal weapon to be used by terrorists. As Tyrese Gibson's designated comic relief character Roman describes, Shaw's guys are pretty much the evil twins of Toretto's team, hence the return of other familiar supporting characters like Han (Sung Kang), Tej (Chris \"Ludicrous\" Bridges) and Gisele (Gal Gadot).<br/><br/>Even as Morgan evolves the franchise, he understands that the character dynamics have been one of the highlights of each film, and this sequel to 'Fast Five' preserves and builds on the relationships that its predecessor established. Besides the budding romance between Han and Gisele (in our opinion, exotic and very nicely played) and the deepening of familial ties between O'Conner and Toretto's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) with the birth of their child, there is sensibly the return of Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), which through the last film, transformed from dogged adversary to unlikely ally.<br/><br/>It is Hobbs who reunites Toretto's team together to pursue Shaw - the strategic equivalent of \"fighting fire with fire\" - with no less than the promise of full pardon if they succeed. Amidst the crowded ensemble, Morgan picks up on a new angle set in motion from the concluding events of the last film. Once presumed dead, Toretto's former squeeze Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) has turned up as one of Shaw's known associates, a good part of the quieter moments of the film spent rekindling the romance between the ex-lovers.<br/><br/>Of course, this isn't a movie with many such moments - except for the occasional expositions about family - so you can forgive the lack of character development for new supporting additions Riley (MMA fighter and 'Haywire' star Gina Carano) and Jah ('The Raid's' Joe Taslim); the former Hobbs' new partner and the latter Shaw's kungfu-kicking henchman. Instead, both Carano and Taslim are there to add a different flavour of adrenaline in the form of close-combat fight scenes, and let's just say that they each get their own sequence to show off their respective moves.<br/><br/>But aside from an impressive bit of tag-team ass-kicking from Toretto and Hobbs against one of Shaw's equally hulk-sized crew (Kim Kold), the bulk of the action is meant to unfold against broad open canvases, as opposed to close quarters. Lin neatly - and we might add, beautifully - choreographs three elaborate chase sequences with loads of automobile destruction that the franchise has been known for, even more extraordinary for how he manages to top one after the next.<br/><br/>In chronological order, Lin begins with a grand introduction to Shaw and his gang with an intricately staged chase down the streets of London - although the fact that Shaw's military-styled vehicle looks like the Batmobile from Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight' trilogy might provide a hint where Lin could have gotten his inspiration. Yet any doubts about Lin's originality are quickly dispelled once we get to the second setpiece, a boldly imagined art of mass destruction matched equally in its stunning execution. As the trailer has amply teased, this one has Toretto and his crew behind the wheel in pursuit of Shaw and his men inside a tank on a Canaries highway.<br/><br/>The most breathtaking of all he leaves for last, which though utterly ludicrous, represents probably one of the most awesome stunt pieces you will see this year. Since no other film has dared to use cars to take down a Russian cargo plane about to take off, Lin does just that. Not only do Toretto's team face off with Shaw's mob in cars racing at near impossible speeds, they attach their vehicles to the wings of the plane with gleeful abandon to any thought of their own lives - though as a warning, not all will make it through to the already announced sequel next summer. If Lin intends to go out with a 'bang', let's just say he accomplishes it many times over.<br/><br/>The exquisitely staged vehicular mayhem is complemented by a firm sense of camaraderie amongst Toretto's group. Gibson's one-liners are snappy and more amusing than they were in 'Fast Five', and his banter with Kang and Ludicrous not only keep the film's momentum going while the plot pieces are put in place but also establish the kind of teamwork necessary for the subsequent action scenes. And not forgetting the brawny charisma of Diesel and Johnson, which enliven the film as much as they did in the last one.<br/><br/>If you ask us to judge this against then-franchise best 'Fast Five', we'd say that this more than tops the fun and excitement that it offered. There are two qualities which make or break a 'Fast and Furious' film - how enjoyable is it to hang out with Toretto and his crew and how thrilling are the car chases. On both counts, this sixth entry surpasses the heights established by its predecessor, setting an even higher bar for its successor. But if the coda before the end credits is anything to go by, there's plenty of reason to get excited for next summer's follow-up.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">The Fast and Furious franchise is one of the more strange ones – it improved the older it became. Coinciding with the 10 year anniversary of the The Fast and the Furious, Fast 5 marked the highpoint in the hugely popular series. Street racing culture was ditched in favor of a heist plot in Rio de Janeiro. To say it worked would be a massive understatement. <br/><br/>Fast 6 is continuing where its predecessor left off, although with a little twist. As it has already been explained in the trailers, the team surrounding Vin Diesel's Torreto character is asked to help Luke Hobbs (played by the ever charismatic Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson) capturing criminal mastermind Owen Shaw (portrayed by Luke Evans), this time around in London. <br/><br/>The Good <br/><br/>Working in its favor is the wonderful backdrop provided by the London metropolitan area. It offers a lot of variety and distinguishes Fast 6 from the previous entry. <br/><br/>The chemistry between Torreto's crew is as good as it has ever been. Furthermore, The Rock really meshes well with any of the gang.<br/><br/>Tyrese, without going into detail the banter he shares with Ludicrous or the aforementioned Dwayne Johnson is worth the ticket admission alone. It's obvious that his character serves as comedic relief, as has been the case in Fast 5, but he has to have the funniest scenes in any of the major (non-comedy) blockbusters this year. <br/><br/>The action in the FF series was never realistic to begin with, so no surprises here. Still, it shouldn't take away from some impressive set- pieces. Justin Lin knows what he's doing. <br/><br/>The Bad <br/><br/>Fast 6 is too crowded; there are too many characters in the movie. Even the main villain, Owen Shaw, is underdeveloped, as is the Letty sub- plot. It just feels like the producers were gung-ho about reuniting the principle actors from the very first FF movie, at any cost. <br/><br/>Gina Carano, though she can definitely hold her own in the action scenes her acting is wooden at best. If pressed for a comparison – she'd be a bad female imitation of notorious stoneface Keanu Reeves. There's little to no facial expression. Frankly, her character is redundant. She may have pulled a half-decent performance in Haywire, but given the nature of her character (a stoic, hardened, operative) it played right to her strengths (or lack thereof?). At this rate it's hard to see her carrying a movie anytime soon. <br/><br/>Conclusion <br/><br/>Fast 6 is one of the better flicks in the franchise, perhaps the second best, but some way off Fast 5. One can't help but feel that the finished product has been rushed into production. A little fine-tuning (no pun intended) here and there would've served the movie better. The ending in particular is a little underwritten; it's not as glorious or as satisfying as Fast 5.</div>]\n"

            "Review Text: I don't think many other franchises has been as turbulent and uneven as The Fast and the Furious films. Things started off pretty earnestly with Rob Cohen's first film, but quickly careened into odd directions, with the ever-cheesy 2 Fast 2 Furious taking off and running with one main character while leaving the other in the dust, and with Tokyo Drift drifting away with totally different characters altogether. Thankfully, Fast & Furious realigned the series with its roots. But it wasn't until Fast Five when I really began to give a darn about this series. Granted that all films have had their fun moments, the fifth film magically tied in every single strand from every single film, and made every single character relevant. Best of all, it did so with a great sense of fun: it had great pacing, amusing comedy, great action, and it made the characters stand out as a collectively outstanding cast.So now Fast & Furious 6 has come out, reuniting the entire gang once more to take on bigger stakes. The spectacle in this film tries its best to be even bigger, more absurd, and more awesome than before: the film is effectively book-ended with two massive action setpieces. The first involves a decently destructive car chase in London, where the villain effectively uses his custom-built ride to launch other cars all over the place. The film's final act features a really crazy sequence in which a tank roars across a highway, crushing other cars and blowing up bridges. This all culminates with all the muscle cars banding together to bring down a massive cargo plane in a fiery blaze of glory. In between, the film slows down a bit, but there's frequent fist-fights and pursuits, a few scenes of witty comedy, and there's one decent car-racing scene.Whether or not you really dig this film may depend on how well you dig the characters and all their dynamics. It definitely helps to watch and understand the events of the first five films, because at this point, they've all been through so much and changed so much; for a late-comer like me, who never was invested in the characters until the last film, it can be confusing to remember who was who and what their history was. Fortunately, the film does insert some flashbacks and reminders for the audience's benefit. If you are keeping up with things, then the film will reward you with a cast of endearing and heartfelt characters, and the film's plot generally revolves around their continuing struggles. As far as the actual plot goes, it's pretty brainless and absurd action-movie fodder, and there are plot holes to be found. However, the film does have the merit of presenting a cast of villains to directly oppose the cast of heroes, and the story pulls out a few surprising twists.The film generally looks good, but many of the action scenes are hectically shot and edited, and it can be hard to tell what's going on in certain scenes. What you can see is awesome, but sometimes, it's just aggravating. Acting is generally fun and enjoyable from the whole cast. Writing gets the job done well enough. This production uses a plethora of quality sets, props, and costumes, with loads of flashy cars at its disposal, and some okay-looking special effects. This film uses some cool hip rap and techno music, while the music score is pretty cool (sounds a lot like Brian Tyler's work from Tokyo Drift, which was one of my favorite soundtracks).Best recommended to fans of the series, especially if you've been following the last few movies.4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)\n",

            "Review Text: Well, this was unexpected! Going into this film I found myself with no hype at all. I expected a good, fun and cheesy movie time and I came out of the theater happy and surprised. While this isn't a masterpiece of filmmaking it does achieve what it sets out to do. To entertain you. And it does this quite good and sometimes it goes further than this by showing us some amazing set pieces and action sequences. For example one car, tank chase sequence! This is achieved by the gigantic production value of the film. You can literally smell the money that comes out of these guys. The whole movie you have this sense of scale, and I mean BIG scale! The amazing sound mixing and design including the music pumps you up and puts you in the mood! While the acting isn't Oscar worthy it is very fluid and it doesn't always feel forced. The chemistry between the cast is very solid and credible. Diesel and \"The Rock\" where pretty solid along with the secondary characters, and the villain was surprisingly tolerable. Another thing that solidifies the movie are the effects. These are outstanding along with the camera-work! The things that brought the movie down for me a little bit where some of the stunts, and weirdly some of these I found pretty amazing but although I understand this movie isn't supposed to be taken seriously there were some stunts that were just plain unbelievable, specially in the third act of the movie. And finally, the plot. While not groundbreaking it did have its interesting points but it doesn't drift away from the cheese factors. Overall I was quite surprised by what this movie did and how the director and producers exploited and used their huge production value. This is an example of a good quality action flick.\n",

            "Review Text: The sixth instalment in The Fast and the Furious franchise, Fast & Furious 6 follows into the footsteps of its predecessor and continues the series' new-found mantra of departing from its original street racing theme to move further into the heist thriller sub-genre. And even if it's not as refreshing & impressive as Fast Five, it nonetheless succeeds as another thrilling, ridiculously entertaining & undeniably fun extravaganza.The story of Fast & Furious 6 concerns Dominic Toretto & his crew, all of whom have retired to a comfortable life following the heist they pulled off in the previous chapter yet they still remain wanted fugitives in their homeland. But when Hobbs asks for their services to take down a skilled mercenary organisation in exchange for clearing their criminal records, Dom accepts the deal and reassembles his team to finish one last job.Directed by Justin Lin, Fast & Furious 6 is his final stint with this franchise and he decides to go out on a high note by delivering a picture that's far too enjoyable to worry about the laws of physics being bent here on few occasions. The screenplay packs in an interesting plot filled with excellent use of humour but it isn't as tightly gripped as the last instalment and is a slight step down in comparison. But a few elements do get an upgrade.The technical aspects follow the same formula that was applied in Fast Five and there isn't much to complain here for the set pieces look spectacularly detailed, the action sequences benefit a lot from its energetic camera-work, brilliant editing & more use of practical effects just like the last chapter although at times the action goes way too over-the-top yet not so exaggerated for most viewers to suspend disbelief. And the background score is fitting for the most part.Coming to the performances, the entire main cast that was present in the last one reprises its role, Michelle Rodrigues also returns to join the gang and Luke Evans is the new addition who plays this chapter's antagonist. Vin Diesel & Paul Walker do their usual best as Toretto & O'Conner, Dwayne Johnson continues to impress as Hobbs, However, Evans doesn't get enough screen time to show his mettle and his characters turns out to be a generic villain. The rest of the cast chips in with fine contributions.On an overall scale, Fast & Furious 6 builds upon the very ingredients that worked in favour of Fast Five and, barring a couple of issues, manages to stay on the track for the most part. Although not as amazing as the previous entry, this is nevertheless an immensely enjoyable blockbuster material that promises a lot of fun & thrills, and effectively delivers it. Definitely more style than substance although the margin isn't as vast as it had been in the first four chapters of this franchise, Fast & Furious 6 comes delightfully recommended.\n",

            "Review Text: While most franchises lose their steam with each succeeding sequel, the Fast and the Furious franchise is that rare exception where its later films breathe in new life into the series. Once a franchise about car racing, \"Fast Five\" took an unexpected turn as a bank heist thriller in the vein of Steven Soderbergh's \"Ocean's 11,\" a welcomed change as seen by its huge box office earnings and critical success. Now, \"Furious 6\" is neither about car racing nor bank heists, but rather a terrorist threat with obvious inspirations from \"The Dark Knight.\" Like \"Fast Five,\" the results are immensely satisfying and undeniably entertaining.The key to the franchise's upward turn in quality is due to director Justin Lin. He is a skilled action director, and many filmmakers can learn a few things or two from him: The action sequences are impressive, engaging, comprehensible, and well-shot, with practical effects to boot. There is a sense of danger, verve, and life in these scenes rarely found in other films, despite how over-the-top and ridiculous they may be; and yes, they often drift into gratify-defying territory. While I usually don't react out loudly when watching a film, this film had me gasping, jaw dropping, laughing, and applauding, sometimes all at once!Another ingredient to the film's success is the chemistry between the cast members. We have grown to love these characters over the course of the series that one cannot help but cheer on for them. In particular, Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous have such a terrific rapport with each other that they provide some of the film's biggest laughs and memorable one-liners. Additionally, Luke Evans is definitely a step up above the previous film's antagonist, and Gina Carano provides some great ass-kicking moments, although not much performance-wise. On another note, I want to mention how refreshing it is to see minority actors fill these roles. Certainly, the film's use of a diverse ensemble cast should be commended. As for the story, it's nothing special, but I dare you not to act surprised when several plot twists are revealed; I did so more than I would like to admit.If there's one thing to learn about this franchise, it's that some change can be a good thing. While the later sequels do focus away from the car racing, they still featured cars, which helped retain old fans while bringing in new ones. \"Furious 6\" is terrific entertainment, and judging by yet another dazzling cliffhanger and the audience's reaction, \"Fast & Furious 7\" will be an amazing finale for the series. Unfortunately, Justin Lin won't be back around for the last installment, but someone please get this man to direct every and all upcoming action flicks.\n",

            "Review Text: Bigger, faster, crazier — that's the motto of the \"Fast & Furious\" franchise six films in. If you thought the action, scale and stunts were off the charts in \"Fast Five,\" prepare to have your mind blown by \"Fast & Furious 6.\" The previous films were an acceleration, and the series hit full throttle with \"Fast Five.\" The road was open and endless for Universal, and returning writer Chris Morgan and director Justin Lin. What they opt to do in \"F&F6\" is bend the limits of reality to their will. From the initial London chase to a highway tank sequence to the grand finale, which involves a massive cargo plane, this is an action movie jacked up on steroids. In fact, there are a couple references to Marvel \"Avengers\" characters — a not-so-subliminal suggestion that Universal would like you to think of Dominic Toretto's crew/family as a team of superheroes.The trouble is for every \"wow!\" moment there are twice the number of \"what?\" moments. The action is so ludicrous that you lose all sense of what's happening. They're like little blackout moments as you drink more and more of the movie's high-octane Kool-Aid.Morgan pulls together a perfectly viable plot. Dom's (Vin Diesel) presumed deceased former lover, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) has been spotted in association with a criminal mastermind named Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) whose ex-military crew is essentially the shadow image of our heroes. Dobbs (Dwayne Johnson) presents this info to Dom in hopes that it'll persuade Dom into doing him favor in taking Shaw down. It naturally works, and the crew must put a hiatus on their quiet life spending all the cash they stole in the last film; when the patriarch of the family calls, you answer.The movie doubles down on the notion of the crew as family. Shaw is supposed to be the antithesis. He doesn't care about allegiances but about precision and planning. He's cold and calculated, whereas the \"family\" is warm and spontaneous. It's cliché, but at least time is spent on the characters. There is only one newbie in former MMA fighter Gina Carano as Hobbs' new right hand, meaning the character time is invested in the existing characters, which is good, though the script doesn't pierce beyond the surface traits we're already familiar with.It also bears mentioning that at one point the script reveals a twist that's solely for the purpose of a twist. This \"surprise\" makes no sense and has no actual bearing on what happens in the film. Morgan wanted a surprise moment to keep things interesting and it's a nice moment — but then you realize it's actually meaningless and changes nothing. Another example of how flash without substance is the M.O. of this series. You have to like flash for the sake of flash to be a big fan.Of course any scene in which an engine of any kind is not running only matters so much in these films, but \"Fast & Furious 6\" will start to really separate out the pure action junkies who've been hooked on this series from those who prefer some plausibility and gravity —literally and figuratively — in their blockbusters. Lin's sensibilities would probably be of more use in a sci-fi or fantasy movie where he could break all laws of common sense and completely get away with it. In this movie, depending on your taste, it will either get you stoked or spoil the moment.One could argue that this franchise has found a niche in larger-than-life action movies — that there's a viable space for films that maintain the trappings of the real world but play by the rules of a superhero movie. That's fair, but in many ways by blowing the ceiling off what's possible, they've created another ceiling. If anything is possible, at some point we will no longer be surprised by the impossible. The films would be better served by maintaining some thread of connection to the laws of physics, then when they broke them a little, it would have a bigger impact. \"Fast Five\" did this well and it's a shame this movie takes such a tremendous leap in believability.Nevertheless, there's an undeniable adrenaline rush that comes with Lin's style of direction and the size and stature of the stunts and action sequences. It's three-fold true in this entry. That's the kind of thrill that maintains a sufficient baseline for enjoying these moves.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more.\n",

            "Review Text: Fast & Furious over the last few installments has become all about action. And the latest outing takes it a step further. Almost 20% of the movie is comprised of action sequences. And at the expense of action, plot, writing, characters all take a backseat. But no one's complaining. Why ? Because the action makes up for all of it.Do the above statements sound cliché ??? The movie's plot is full of such silly dialogs so its best ignored in the current context. What works is the action - Lin and his crew bring us some of the most ridiculously outrageous and boldly conceived action sequences. There's an intense chase through London in the initial reels and also a race later on. There's a whole plane take-off-crash sequence towards the end that you've probably got a glimpse of in the trailers. The girls are no slouches either and we see an intense hand-to-hand fight of sorts between Michelle Rodriguez's Letty and Gina Carano's Riley.But the movie's best sequence is undoubtedly the 10 minute Tank chase across the freeway that involves most of the cast and culminates in a breathtaking \"catch\" (about which I'd not say any further). The camera cuts like crazy, music is pulsating and that single sequence is probably worth the price of the movie ticket.Apart from action, Furious 6 doesn't have much going for it. Dialog is standard, at times even silly and predictable, characters are flat, performances are decent. The car chases and night scenes got me so involved, I actually felt a bit strange leaving the theater and coming out into the real world's broad daylight. And the post-credits scene is simply, a treat which makes the next installment in the series worth looking forward to. Suffice it to say that in the end, the movie drifts full circle.Watch it for the action, and for the action alone. If you expect any sort of character development or family issues like the first installment had, you'll be disappointed. Else, you're in for one hell of a ride.Score: 7 / 10\n",

            "Title: Fast & Furious 6 is The best film in the franchise that I love to Death!\n",
            "Review Text: Fast & Furious 6 (2013) is the best of the best Action film in the series franchise! It's Justin Lin's Masterpiece and I love it to death. Sorry but is not Fast Five and Furious 7 the best, but is Fast & Furious 6 the best one in the franchise! This my favorite best film of the franchise that I just love to death! The film has great cast and great action, great dialogue! It is the last time that Paul Walker starts in this film. In Furious 7 was his brother who was portraying Brian O'Conner with a fake CGI. In here Paul Walker is real, Justin Lin started a great franchise which ended in this film.Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson reunite for this sixth installment in the 'Fast and Furious' action thriller franchise, directed by Justin Lin. After their lucrative Rio heist, and unable to return home, Dom (Vin Diesel) and the rest of his compatriots are forced to kill time lying low in different locations around the world. When DSS agent Hobbs offers Dom and his crew full pardons in return for taking down Owen Shaw (Luke Evans)'s gang of mercenary drivers, the offer seems too good to pass. But as the rivals head for a showdown on the streets of London, Dom learns that Shaw's second-in-command is none other than his presumed dead former lover, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez).I love This film to death! This film is about rescuing Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and stopping a brilliant mastermind terrorist hijacker Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) and his team of hijackers.Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson and Michelle Rodriguez lead a cast of returning all-stars as the global blockbuster franchise built on speed delivers the biggest adrenaline rush yet in this explosive Action Film. Hobbs (Johnson) has been tracking an organization of lethally skilled drivers, whose mastermind (Luke Evans) is aided by the love Dom (Diesel) thought was dead, Letty (Rodriguez). The only way to stop the criminal mercenaries from stealing a top secret weapon is to outmatch them at street level, so Hobbs asks for the help of Dom and his elite team. Payment for the ultimate chase? Full pardons for all of them and a chance to make their families whole again.The \"Fast & Furious\" franchise has always been a personal favorite of mine. Sure, as a whole, they're fairly easy to pass off as mindless action films for film goers who want a good rush of big-budget Hollywood action, but I've mostly seen them as more of a chugging train of car movies that simply get better with each new installment, and that's no exception with \"Fast & Furious 6,\" which I'd probably say is the best addition to the series so far. I don't think I've been this thoroughly entertained by an action sequel in a while. The car chases and stunts are bigger, wilder, and more over-the-top than ever before, the characters' previously limited personalities continue to grow quite impressively, and the story manages to be both awesomely ridiculous and surprisingly engaging from start to finish (even though we all know which side is gonna come out victorious in the end). The action is glorious while it lasts, but then the film goes back to figuring out how to keep its over sized vessel from taking on water. And that's more hard work than it's worth.Still, the best thing about this flick is the character interaction, even with actors whose roles are this limited. Letty's amnesia adds an interesting soapy twist to the plot that forces Dom to constantly try to remind her why she loves him. Brian's fatherhood also lets Paul Walker do a bit of enjoyably self-serious acting of his own. Otherwise, Tyrese Gibson and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges are left with the snappy comedic relief, while Gina Carano, Gal Gadot, and Elas Pataky merely get to look feisty and hot in their action scenes (but at least they do a great job at it). As for Dwayne Johnson, he gives an unusually deadpan performance this time around, with only just a few outrageous outbursts of manly banter here and there. Nonetheless, the cast here is consistently entertaining, with the screenplay letting everyone get a chance to shine, even if some of them aren't quite as memorable as others. The script delivered an action moments with high explosions on an airplane that are not forgettable. I love that fight between Gina Carano & Michelle Rodriguez which it was tremendous. I love this film to death! I love this film to death, Fast & Furious 6 is the best! The battles on airplane are Epic! I consider it as Justin Lin's Masterpiece.\n",

            "Review Text: The faster the cars in this franchise seem to go, the more realism seems to go away with it. Sure, the action and car chases in \"Fast & Furious 6\" is breathtaking and spectacular, but the movie was just a tad over the top.I sat down to watch \"Fast & Furious 6\" simply because I had the opportunity, and because I wanted to watch it because of Michelle Rodriguez. I can't say that I had any particular hopes or expectations to this movie, nor can I claim that it was a movie release that I was in any way looking forward to.If you have seen any of the previous five movies then you know exactly what you will get here. There is nothing much new to be had here, it is essentially the same. However, that being said, then the movie is enjoyable, entertaining and fast-paced.This sixth installment to the franchise brings the return of an assumed dead member of the Toretto 'family' and it also brings the departure of one. The returning member is, of course, Letty. I am not going to reveal who will be departing - you'll just have to watch the movie for yourself and find out.As entertaining as the action was in the movie, then the last whole segment was a bit too much. I mean, a car bring down a massive Russian cargo airplane? That was just too much. And how long does it take for a plane of that size to get enough speed to become airborne? It just took forever. And speaking of forever, then that tarmac runway had to be the longest in the world - it just went on and on.As with the previous movies, then it is a great ensemble of actors and actresses, and it is as always a joy to have them returning to their parts, and there is a great chemistry between the various characters. I was especially thrilled to see Joe Taslim (playing Jah) in the movie; he did a great job in \"The Raid: Redemption\" and its great to see him make it into American cinema as well. He is definitely a guy to keep an eye on in the future.\"Fast & Furious 6\" is, as the previous five movies, a guy's movie - full of adrenaline, muscle cars, car chases, macho guys and testosterone dripping off everywhere. The story was enjoyable, even with the part that went off the scale. And if you enjoyed any of the previous movies, then you definitely want to watch \"Fast & Furious 6\" as well.\n",

            "Review Text: Mixed emotions his the viewer seeing FAST AND FURIOUS 6 for the first time knowing that Paul Walker is gone and wondering what will happen with the in process Fast and Furious 7. But in ways that fact makes this movie more treasured. It is a whoop-'em up fast action packed film that takes your breath away with the wild car chases and one the ground derring- do. Writer Chris Morgan and director Justin Lin have this medium down to a predictable but fine science.The plot is fairly simple (as usual) allowing the telling of the story to be more important than any big philosophical notions. Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson, with even larger biceps varices!) has Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) reassemble their crew (Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Sung Kang) in order to take down mastermind Shaw (Luke Evans) who commands an organization of mercenary drivers across 12 countries. Payment? Full pardons for them all. The big driver is to 'rescue' Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who seems to be with Shaw's group after suffering amnesia, back into their fold. Wild situations abound and they are as exciting as ever – if not more so!Definitely worth watching even for those who are not long term F & F fans. It is a terrific action film with sparkling actors having a great time. Grady Harp December 13\n",

            "Review Text: The Fast and Furious franchise has undergone a radical transformation since launching 12 years ago, with the changes following Justin Lin taking hold of directorial duties from Tokyo Drift (film three) onwards.The series has made the transition from street races to include drugs, heists, and now terrorism, while lead characters Dom Toretto (Diesel) and Brian O'Conner (Walker) have gone from petty thug and law enforcer to wanted fugitives.With an opening sequence reminiscent of Quantum of Solace, Toretto and Brian screech around mountaintops as the latter readies himself to become a father, demonstrating how adult and family-minded they've become. Meanwhile, what follows is a nice refresher for those acquainted with the series and for newcomers alike, acting as a highlights reel to bring everyone up to speed of the events experienced in the previous five films.The antagonist for Fast 6 is Mr Owen Shaw (Evans), a former special ops military man that uses his knowledge, contacts and fast cars to make robberies for the highest bidder. In this instance, it just so happens he has his eyes on a chip that would incite terrorism in the wrong hands, which prompts baby oil-loving federal agent Hobbs (Johnson) to round up Toretto and his crew for back-up, offering them full pardons in exchange for their services.London is the main backdrop for the film, which, naturally, features a very corny cameo, though the the bright lights, black taxis and double-decker buses dotted around the city are infinitely more welcome.For me, five was the best of all of the films, but six gives it a run for its money, taking the stunts to ridiculous new heights (literally). You could, of course, reprimand the film for its use of impossible feats, but that's the whole point of these films, right? To get bigger and more extreme, as demonstrated with the big and extreme – and always affable – introduction of Johnson in Fast Five.For me, Johnson changed the game and breathed new life into a franchise that was beginning to get stale, and seeing Hobbs join forces with Toretto and co makes for brilliant viewing. The action is insane and the banter is electric, with the camaraderie between the cast obvious.The only criticism of the film is its length. There was a particular moment that seemed as though the film had wrapped, though it continued for another half hour, and while what followed was laced with adrenaline and big bangs, the film could have done with a 20 minute tightening.Shaw isn't an intimidating or imposing character, particularly when facing off against Hobbs and Toretto, but he is devious, ruthless and sharp, presenting an entirely new threat to the series.Those in the know will be aware Tokyo Drift threw the timeline entirely out of sequence, but the game comes full circle at the end of the film, and you won't want to miss the credits sequence that follows Originally posted at www.zentertainmentweekly.com7/10\n",

            "Review Text: I still can't believe I am giving a 9.0 to a film that is #6 in a brainless action franchise!I am not aware of any other franchise (except maybe, strangely enough, f13) where #6 is the best of the series. Normally the energy, creativity are gone by then.Not this time.I simply cannot believe how much I enjoyed every single minute of this film!There was even a decent plot!! (hey, for a film that is basically made up of fast cars, explosions and fight scenes, that says a lot!)However, I won't go into the plot - because there are some REAL twists in it, and it is better to go in with a fresh mind.It does help if you have seen the prior 5, but no sweat if you haven't. What really pleasantly surprised me was how funny this film was!! I would say about 1/2 the film was gut splitting comedy. It is rare that most jokes work in a film. Usually some fall flat. Not in this one! every single joke worked. I laughed so hard that I know I missed some!This is really meant to be seen on the big screen with a large crowd. I can't remember the last time so many people laughed, went 'WHOA!\" and \"yeah\" even clapping during a film!The film starts off with a bang and ends with a post-ending that will make you grin from ear to ear.The film deals with criminals who are obsessed with fast cars and like to create mayhem with their cars.Wall to wall action, comedy with just the right amount of drama and love interest.This could be \"the\" measurement for the brainless-feel-good-summer- action film.The only reason I am not giving this a 10.0 is because 1) it was a little long.. the final scene was almost a movie in itself (but it was a hoot!), and 2) in general I don't think any film is perfect. In some scenes (thankfully only a few) there were too many close ups that made it a little hard to follow the action. But I am really nitpicking here, folks.If you like action, fast cars, explosions, comedy....run, don't walk to see F&F 6.(and this from a guy who has the Seventh Seal and Alexander Nevsky in his DVD collection)\n",

            "Review Text: As the Fast & Furious franchise continues with it's simple enjoyments of fast cars, well oiled muscles and sexy ladies. This film does meet expectations, and is your typical faster and bigger sequel. This time the story follows Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and the gang. Who are this time not being chased but being recruited by Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson). To bring down international criminal Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) who is aided by once thought of dead Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez).What is good about the film is Director's, Justin Lin's decision to keep the film in a action-oriented direction. With a slight nods to it's street racing past. But focusing on 80's big muscle, big explosions nostalgia. Also the continuing use of practical effects over CGI backgrounds and locations. Make the film look all the more impressive. The action is over the top and a little silly but i did very much enjoy it. The only poor bit being a moment where Vin Diesel's character saves someone life taking the ridiculousness a bit to far. With the ever expanding cast the writers i imagine do have their work cut out for them. But everyone in the film except Jordana Brewster who again is given the short shrift do get their moments. But some of the comedy does miss it's mark, and the return of Letty is given the thinnest and quite unoriginal of explanations for her return. Also because of the huge cast of good guys, there is a lack of development for the villains. Making it difficult for Luke Evans who is actually very good in his role, to make a strong impression and did not become the threat to the team as much as he should of. This is a fun film, so just turn off your brain and enjoy the ride and be prepared for a very decent post credit sequence hopefully setting up a possibly very exciting Fast 7.\n",

            "Review Text: The previous installments of this franchise (specifically 1,2, Tokyo Drift and 4) was all about racing, sure there's a plot but it wasn't really shown well, then part 5 happened and the franchise took a different turn, it now became a heist film instead of the usual racing. I hated and I loved this turn of the franchise, I hated it because in part 5, the racing competition aspect of the film is gone, it became chases but I also loved this turn because it made the franchise take a different approach. My question is, will this formula still work with part 6? Find out below.Story: The story in this movie picks up after the previous one where it was known that 'Letty' (Michelle Rodriguez) was still alive and I admit that they handled her \"resurrection\" quite well but that is only the sub-plot of this movie. The main plot is Hobbs (The Rock) is chasing after Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). He then gets the help of Toretto and Brian's crew by using Letty as bait (or that's how I see it). The story is pretty simple and they told it without adding anymore sub plot but some of the sub plots that were made felt very crowded to the story even though it was solved. It just felt a little heavy and a bit too much for the movie.Acting: If you saw the previous installments from this franchise well then you ain't missing anything from their performance, it's pretty much the same but I have to say this though, Vin Diesel and The Rock displays pure bad-assery in this movie. That being said, I will give my two cents on the two characters from this movie which are Gina Carano who played Riley and Luke Evans who is Owen Shaw. Carano was able to hold her own despite having little dialogue and what makes her character seems badass is because of her action scene, this is actually one of the things I'm looking forward to upon seeing this movie because I loved her in 'Haywire' (awesome film, check it out) and I;m confident to say that I am not disappointed with her on this one. Next is Luke Evans, he IMO is one the versatile actors in the industry today, you can cast him in almost any role and he displays a good performance. In here is the main villain although he gave a good performance in this role I find it hard to find him as an effective villain, there is something missing with his performance here I'm just not sure what it is.Action: The Fast franchise is definitely known for having one of the best car chases ever and this one doesn't disappoint and it does not only have car chases but also fist fights, head bangin' and other sh*t. Even though some of the action scene were very over the top it was still entertaining and was handled pretty well. The action was not violent or brutal as it showed little to no blood and being a fan of R-13 I can say that this rating does not fit well to the style of FF and I'm happy and contented with it's PG-13 rating. IMO this is the most action-packed FF film so far.Cinematography: The cinematographer did a wonderful job here, the shots were just amazing and adds depth to the mood that is set within each scene. The shots were able to show scenery that really captures the beauty of the set and like I said the mood of the scene.Direction: I wasn't much of a fan of Lin's direction here, it was pretty slow which made the film a little boring for me despite having heavy action. Even though the movie is a little slow paced, Lin was able to tell the story with it's whole heart. I liked how he did the pacing in FF 5 though.Overall: 'Fast and Furious 6' was high-octane action movie injected with some humor. Using the same formula as the previous one made this film good and also bringing back the racing aspect of the original FF films. While I consider the FF 5 is still the best one in the franchise, I can still say that this is one solid addition to it. I give this movie a 3.5/5P.S. Watch the post-credit scene, it made me get hyped for Fast and Furious 7.\n",

            "Review Text: I'm going to keep this short, simple and sweet because that is exactly what this film is. It's great summer fun for all ages that manages to succeed on the one thing I hate in horror movies; make an idiot of itself. It is where this stupidity in plot events comes from that gives the film its fuel to do nothing but provide brainless over-the-top popcorn fun. It is done so by having some of the best sound editing I have heard in a while with brilliantly paced action sequences, with one fight scene in particular that will surly be the best action scene of the year. I recommend Furious 6 if you're looking to have some fun, but whatever you do, do not walk in there expecting The King's Speech, because it is not what this movie is trying to be- which makes this film so admirable.Grade: B+\n",

            "Review Text: I went to the cinema with quite low expectations due to the trailer. However after watching this film i was amazed by the outcome. There was so much thrilling tense action, at one point i was on the edge of my seat. The fights and the car chases were magnificent. The series seems to be getting better and better. Fast and furious 6 is by far the best one, and i can't wait for number 7. There was so much going on and the ending was awesome. I will definitely buy this on DVD when it comes out. Great acting from the casts. This is the most entertaining film of 2013 so far. There was epic cars, sexy girls and brilliant locations.10/10\n",

            "Review Text: The Fast and the Furious franchise has never been known for an engrossing story. No one goes to the movies to see character development and a complicated storyline. They go for the cars, the girls, and the explosions, and this installment has all of the above, including a fair story.A ghost from Dom's past, Letty, has come back from the dead, and Dom reunites the team from Fast Five (a team that works on all levels) in order to get her back. Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson provide some of the humor of the film, with their bantering back and forth throughout, but I found that the theater I was in laughed and cheered throughout the course of the movie. The action is good, and never lets up. For a film that is over two hours, I found myself only checking the time when I thought the finale was happening (to see how long it would be).What you want in this film is something as good as Fast Five. Something original and fresh. What you get is something that improves on Fast Five (and the rest of the series) on all levels. This is by far the best Fast and Furious movie ever, and it really shows how a series like this can turn around from something as bad as Tokyo Drift.And it has a nice set up for Fast & Furious 7 during the credits, where we get a little surprise for the villain of the next film.Bravo, this film is awesome, and should be viewed by fans of both the series and of action movies in general.8/10\n",

            "Review Text: Really, how many franchises can claim to be at their best the sixth time round? But that is exactly where the 'Fast and Furious' team are at with this exercise in pure exhilaration. Just when we feared that it might be difficult to top the jaw-dropping finale in 'Fast Five', director Justin Lin proves that he has reserved his best one yet for what has been announced as his final outing at the helm after four consecutive runs.Continuing what began as an invigorating transition from streetcar racing to heist film the last time round, resident scribe Chris Morgan ups the stakes by pitting our favourite anti-heroes against their most dangerous opponent yet. That man is Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), an ex-SAS officer turned mercenary who leads a nefarious gang of criminals bent on stealing the components capable of assembling a lethal weapon to be used by terrorists. As Tyrese Gibson's designated comic relief character Roman describes, Shaw's guys are pretty much the evil twins of Toretto's team, hence the return of other familiar supporting characters like Han (Sung Kang), Tej (Chris \"Ludicrous\" Bridges) and Gisele (Gal Gadot).Even as Morgan evolves the franchise, he understands that the character dynamics have been one of the highlights of each film, and this sequel to 'Fast Five' preserves and builds on the relationships that its predecessor established. Besides the budding romance between Han and Gisele (in our opinion, exotic and very nicely played) and the deepening of familial ties between O'Conner and Toretto's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) with the birth of their child, there is sensibly the return of Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), which through the last film, transformed from dogged adversary to unlikely ally.It is Hobbs who reunites Toretto's team together to pursue Shaw - the strategic equivalent of \"fighting fire with fire\" - with no less than the promise of full pardon if they succeed. Amidst the crowded ensemble, Morgan picks up on a new angle set in motion from the concluding events of the last film. Once presumed dead, Toretto's former squeeze Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) has turned up as one of Shaw's known associates, a good part of the quieter moments of the film spent rekindling the romance between the ex-lovers.Of course, this isn't a movie with many such moments - except for the occasional expositions about family - so you can forgive the lack of character development for new supporting additions Riley (MMA fighter and 'Haywire' star Gina Carano) and Jah ('The Raid's' Joe Taslim); the former Hobbs' new partner and the latter Shaw's kungfu-kicking henchman. Instead, both Carano and Taslim are there to add a different flavour of adrenaline in the form of close-combat fight scenes, and let's just say that they each get their own sequence to show off their respective moves.But aside from an impressive bit of tag-team ass-kicking from Toretto and Hobbs against one of Shaw's equally hulk-sized crew (Kim Kold), the bulk of the action is meant to unfold against broad open canvases, as opposed to close quarters. Lin neatly - and we might add, beautifully - choreographs three elaborate chase sequences with loads of automobile destruction that the franchise has been known for, even more extraordinary for how he manages to top one after the next.In chronological order, Lin begins with a grand introduction to Shaw and his gang with an intricately staged chase down the streets of London - although the fact that Shaw's military-styled vehicle looks like the Batmobile from Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight' trilogy might provide a hint where Lin could have gotten his inspiration. Yet any doubts about Lin's originality are quickly dispelled once we get to the second setpiece, a boldly imagined art of mass destruction matched equally in its stunning execution. As the trailer has amply teased, this one has Toretto and his crew behind the wheel in pursuit of Shaw and his men inside a tank on a Canaries highway.The most breathtaking of all he leaves for last, which though utterly ludicrous, represents probably one of the most awesome stunt pieces you will see this year. Since no other film has dared to use cars to take down a Russian cargo plane about to take off, Lin does just that. Not only do Toretto's team face off with Shaw's mob in cars racing at near impossible speeds, they attach their vehicles to the wings of the plane with gleeful abandon to any thought of their own lives - though as a warning, not all will make it through to the already announced sequel next summer. If Lin intends to go out with a 'bang', let's just say he accomplishes it many times over.The exquisitely staged vehicular mayhem is complemented by a firm sense of camaraderie amongst Toretto's group. Gibson's one-liners are snappy and more amusing than they were in 'Fast Five', and his banter with Kang and Ludicrous not only keep the film's momentum going while the plot pieces are put in place but also establish the kind of teamwork necessary for the subsequent action scenes. And not forgetting the brawny charisma of Diesel and Johnson, which enliven the film as much as they did in the last one.If you ask us to judge this against then-franchise best 'Fast Five', we'd say that this more than tops the fun and excitement that it offered. There are two qualities which make or break a 'Fast and Furious' film - how enjoyable is it to hang out with Toretto and his crew and how thrilling are the car chases. On both counts, this sixth entry surpasses the heights established by its predecessor, setting an even higher bar for its successor. But if the coda before the end credits is anything to go by, there's plenty of reason to get excited for next summer's follow-up.\n",

            "Review Text: The Fast and Furious franchise is one of the more strange ones – it improved the older it became. Coinciding with the 10 year anniversary of the The Fast and the Furious, Fast 5 marked the highpoint in the hugely popular series. Street racing culture was ditched in favor of a heist plot in Rio de Janeiro. To say it worked would be a massive understatement. Fast 6 is continuing where its predecessor left off, although with a little twist. As it has already been explained in the trailers, the team surrounding Vin Diesel's Torreto character is asked to help Luke Hobbs (played by the ever charismatic Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson) capturing criminal mastermind Owen Shaw (portrayed by Luke Evans), this time around in London. The Good Working in its favor is the wonderful backdrop provided by the London metropolitan area. It offers a lot of variety and distinguishes Fast 6 from the previous entry. The chemistry between Torreto's crew is as good as it has ever been. Furthermore, The Rock really meshes well with any of the gang.Tyrese, without going into detail the banter he shares with Ludicrous or the aforementioned Dwayne Johnson is worth the ticket admission alone. It's obvious that his character serves as comedic relief, as has been the case in Fast 5, but he has to have the funniest scenes in any of the major (non-comedy) blockbusters this year. The action in the FF series was never realistic to begin with, so no surprises here. Still, it shouldn't take away from some impressive set- pieces. Justin Lin knows what he's doing. The Bad Fast 6 is too crowded; there are too many characters in the movie. Even the main villain, Owen Shaw, is underdeveloped, as is the Letty sub- plot. It just feels like the producers were gung-ho about reuniting the principle actors from the very first FF movie, at any cost. Gina Carano, though she can definitely hold her own in the action scenes her acting is wooden at best. If pressed for a comparison – she'd be a bad female imitation of notorious stoneface Keanu Reeves. There's little to no facial expression. Frankly, her character is redundant. She may have pulled a half-decent performance in Haywire, but given the nature of her character (a stoic, hardened, operative) it played right to her strengths (or lack thereof?). At this rate it's hard to see her carrying a movie anytime soon. Conclusion Fast 6 is one of the better flicks in the franchise, perhaps the second best, but some way off Fast 5. One can't help but feel that the finished product has been rushed into production. A little fine-tuning (no pun intended) here and there would've served the movie better. The ending in particular is a little underwritten; it's not as glorious or as satisfying as Fast 5.\n",

            "[<div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Perhaps Furious 7 wouldn't have that Box Office success and Popularity if the sudden death of one the main protagonists, Paul Walker AKA Brian O'Conner wouldn't have gotten in the way.<br/><br/>But this is how it is. The heartbreaking death of Paul in that terrible car crash has made this movie so special to the heart of the long standing fans. The script can be so cliché and full of inconsistencies, this movie is the last film of Paul Walker and will always be.<br/><br/>But what makes me to give that high note is the ending scene and the awesome tribute the rest of the fast and furious 'familia' made to Paul. They could have gotten his character to die like we have seen so many times in the past. Instead the scriptwriters rewrote the script to make a celebration of life and family.<br/><br/>In fact, This entire saga is more about family than cars. Cars and race are just the theme and the objects attracting our attention. But the most important part of that story is the strong relationship between the characters and their interprets who are as linked in real life as they are in the movie. Each time one of their own dies they face it together as the actors are actually doing it with the loss of Paul the only REAL loss of this community. And this is what is making this beautiful.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">The Fast and the Furious series consist of 7 movies soon to be 8, starring The Rock-Dwayne Johnson in the last 3 movies, Vin Diesel- The voice of Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy, and the late Paul Walker who has been in many action movies, along with Gal Gadot who is set to play Wonder Woman in the line of DC comics movies unfortunately Gal Gadot's character Chazelle died in Fast and Furious 6 , Michelle Rodriguez, Tyreese Gibson from Transformers, Ludicrous is a musician as well as an actor, Jordana Brewster and the antagonist is Deckard Shaw played by Jason Statham who has been in one million and one action movies. For those who have seen Fast and Furious 6 the perpetrator of those events is Owen Shaw played by Luke Evans who is in Immortals, The Hobbit the Desolation of Smaug, The Battle of the Armies, Deckard is Owen's older brother out for revenge, because Dominic Torreto's (Vin Diesel) team put Owen in the hospital. Fast and Furious 7 is packed full of action stunts that are bigger than the last movie, that take you to multiple countries all around the world, America, Abu Dhabi, Canada and multiple locations in USA. After Deckard Shaw is placed in solitary confinement in one of the most secure facilities, the team are on a beach with all their new cars lined up behind them, because of Paul Walker's death, the makers of the movie changed the ending. Dominic knows Brian O Conner (Paul Walker) doesn't belong with him anymore because he has a wife, one child and another on the way. Dominic drives off and leaves Brian behind, you see him in his car driving off into the distance when Brian now played by Paul's brother Cody Walker and some added effects, Brian says \"You thought you could leave without saying goodbye\". Dom smiles then they go their separate ways when the road forks. This ending wasn't just about Dom saying goodbye to Brian, it was about Vin saying goodbye to Paul, then the credits open with ' See you again' by Charlie Puth and Wiz Kalihifa, this song is a tribute to Paul Walker.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">I wasn't quite sure what to expect from the seventh installment of this successful franchise but I was totally blown away by the seamless and well choreographed fight scenes and car chases. What makes this movie stand out from its predecessors is how it goes beyond the modding of Japanese street cars to engaging the viewer with a very decent storyline that pulls together all of the previous movies. I particularly liked the use of the cut-scenes from previous films that reminded viewers of the continuity of one helluva story.<br/><br/>Of course, the other side of going to see this movie was knowing the loss of its prime star - Paul Walker - to a shocking car accident last year, and wondering how much of a role he would play in the film and how well they would work their CGI magic into his role. Needless to say, it was very well done (even though you could tell when they did use CGI of his face in a few scenes).<br/><br/>Not trying to give anything away, but the final 5 minutes was a fitting send off for Paul. I'm sure there was a few takes for the final scene on the beach.<br/><br/>Great film. 10/10 from me.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Really entertaining and fun, vin diesel is really good and I really miss Paul walker, he and Vin diesel worked well together.<br/><br/>Jason Statham is really believable as a cool badass coming after the main fast family, and stupid fun car stunts.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Furious 7 is badass. This movie is way different than the previous installments, due to James Wan, who was a fantastic director and had great camera shots in this. The fight scenes were awesome,the Statham and Rock fight is one of the best in the whole series. The audience was cheering and clapping through the whole film. The movie was also hilarious due to the comedic sides of Tyrese and Ludicrous. It was interesting to see how they dealt with Paul Walker,the CGI could've been better but I loved the way they used archive footage of him.Along with the action, there is a very emotional side to this movie. There are certain scenes that are very sad and one of them,Paul actually filmed. Overall,this movie was packed with tons of action,badass one-liners,and a farewell to an amazing actor and person. Rest in Peace Paul Walker.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">With his brother in a comatose condition in the hospital, \"Deckard Shaw\" (Jason Statham) swears vengeance on \"Dominic Toretto\" (Vin Diesel) and his team who put him there. Now, while this should certainly be a possible cause for concern to any normal person, the fact of the matter is that Deckard is a highly trained and extremely skilled professional assassin who has a terrorist organization at his disposal to help him out. Fortunately, Dominic also has some resources of his own with \"Luke Hobbs\" (Dwayne Johnson) and a shadowy government official who calls himself \"Mr. Nobody\" (Kurt Russell) who have separate agendas which coincide with Dominic's plans to kill Deckard before he can kill them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this picture definitely had the talent to be a very fine film. Unfortunately, the director (James Wan) resorted to one preposterous stunt after another which made this film look rather ridiculous in my opinion. Having said that, those who are fans of this particular franchise will probably love this movie for the simple fact that it has plenty of action and some of their favorite actors. Unfortunately, the complete lack of realism severely damaged its credibility in my eyes and I have rated it accordingly. Below average.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">fast and furious series is not made to get Oscars or golden globes these movies are made for the young people to have a thrill and bang for their money.This movie has all the youth asks for Action, very little drama,hot babes in bikinis, car chases and of course the stuff getting blown up to pieces. if you are a young person between 18 to 28 you'll love it and if you young by heart you'll adore it.but if you are looking for award winning performances this wont be the movie for you so critics might not like it for having the same old chase and kill concept of action movies but youth will love it because they once more saw their favorite actors do what they do best.drive cars and then do whats unthinkable. also to add as this movie is like a tribute to the passing of Paul walker(R.I.P.)they have managed to put on the best farewell moments for him using CGI and body doubles of course and i think think movie justifies it very much.so go on watch this movie i bet you'll feel nostalgic all over again and also in the end you might end up in tears so do bring the tissues with you</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">I rarely write reviews but i feel this one deserves one that isn't one of the overwhelmingly clouded reviews, that mix real world tragedy into the rating of a fictional piece of work.<br/><br/>The movie is entertaining for everyone that knows what to expect and the ridiculousness of the action scenes is fun in itself. Other than that, this movie is far away from the masterpiece a lot of people make it out to be. Especially the serious parts of the dialogue are a 101 on clichéd movie lines and the story is as surprising as the content of a bag of chips. Paul Walker was a decent actor and his death is mourned by many but an emotional 5 minute tribute at the end of the movie, that also seems tacked on in terms of the storyline, is swaying many into thinking they witnessed a new Shawshank Redemption or The Godfather movie.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the series you're in for a great ride and if you're into action movies in general you won't waste your time with this one. Just keep an honest perspective about this movies place in history.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">I never understood why this franchise always made so much money and why so many people like it. Unless you like to see half naked women sponging on wet cars, cars with modified engines used in street races (and of course it's all done in a team of outlaw guys, the so-called \"family\", against other teams with people with similar desires) and to escape the police (police haters, they should inflate the scores here in IMDb), and to illicit traffic drugs and money, this type of film is not for you.<br/><br/>I have a theory of mine because this series remains strong in the box office and each film gets better box office than the previous film of this franchise. The secret lies in the breakdown of our society. When this franchise began in 2001, our society was morally not decadent as it is today, nor so violent. In the last 16 years our society has grown worse and the values ​​of the old days began to disappear and our society and the moviegoers in general began to identify more and more ,each time, with the \"characters\" of this type of film. This is the only explanation, which I see, because every movie this franchise has billed every time the previous movie.<br/><br/>Not anything, in this movie at the level of content or structure that is worth as a film, whether purely as fun / entertaining or for possible logical/ make you think. Not a single quality exists in this film (or in this franchise, but actually beyond the seventh film, I only saw the second film in this series (which I consider absolute crap).<br/><br/>Anything. Plot is not interesting, shallow characters like a plate, unless you like what they do. Characters with generic lines and say cool one liner to impress the younger ones. Bureaucratic action scenes - two guys jump with a sport car at high speed between two skyscrapers. The damage is minimal, almost non-existent. Ridiculous ending. Chiché story and action scenes without suspense, tension or in a interesting way visually. At least.<br/><br/>A waste of time, at least for me.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">This film tells the story of a team of daredevil drivers who ate recruited by the secret service to rescue a kidnapped hacker who has invented a powerful surveillance software.<br/><br/>With the series being the who's who of conventional action superstars, \"Fast And Furious 7\" finally corrected the conspicuous absence of Jason Statham. He certainly doesn't disappoint, as every star deliver awesome action scenes. This film is different from the others because it's really good. It's not ridiculous and brainless like \"The Expendables\" series; and it's not attention deficit like the Bourne series. This combines action, brains and emotions, which is a perfect blend for blockbuster success. <br/><br/>The action scenes are simply awesome. The scene of a car flying between buildings is superb, but by no means the best. There are so many other astounding scenes that got me holding my breath, literally. For example, Paul Walker trying to escape from a bus is a scene that made me stop breathing because it's so intense. The film is so packed with action, but it doesn't feel fragmented or attention deficit. That is what makes it stand above other action films.<br/><br/>\"Fast And Furious 7\" constantly surprises me with jaw dropping action. Just when I thought I have seen everything, and nothing can surprise me anymore, the surprises keep on coming. I'm truly amazed by the film. I guess no one thought James Wan could make such an awe inspiring film, after establishing himself as a great horror director.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Dominic Toretta (Vin Diesel) gets his Team together to take out Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) who is on a revenge kick blaming Dominic for his brother lying in a coma. But first, the Team must find and protect Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) a master Hacker/Programmer, who created God's Eye, a program that can locate anyone anywhere on the planet. Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell), the head of Black Ops, says Ramsey must be found if Dominic wants his help with Shaw.<br/><br/>This should be watched for the stunts and CGI as both are terrific. We will see cars race down a mountain side with many trees in the way; and also see a car jump from one hi-rise building in Dubai into another hi-rise building. These stunts or CGI (who can tell anymore) will take your breath away.<br/><br/>The pacing is very good for these stunts and CGI, but when Dominic and Shaw did hand-to-hand combat it went on forever. The scene would cut away often to the Team in cars trying to avoid the helicopter intent on taking them out with missiles, then revert back to these two who were still at it. Did I mention \"still\" at it. Yes, way too long. <br/><br/>The real winners in here are, of course, the stunts and CGI because they were terrific. And mention must be made for the photography, editing and cinematography as they were spot on.<br/><br/>Notables: Dwayne Johnson as Hobbs, Michelle Rodrigues as Letty, Lucacris as Tej, Jordana Brewster as Mia, Tyrese Gibson as Roman, Lucas Black as Sean, and Ronda Rousey the Champion MMA fighter. You will see Rhonda as Kara in a white dress fighting Letty. (a cat fight?) And certainly Paul Walker (Brian) who died in a car crash (he was not driving) during the filming of Furious 7. The song \"See you Again\" that played in the movie was a tribute to Paul Walker.<br/><br/>All in all this was terrific and the action never dragged or went on for too long as scene changes helped that out a lot. This will be hard to top and there is talk of Furious 8. Ready for it? (9/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: Bikini and thong backsides. Language: Small stuff and not much of it.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">After \"Fast &amp; Furious 6\" shifted the action of this mega-series into a gear not known to man — one resembling a superhero movie far more than an action franchise — those following the \"Fast &amp; Furious\" had to either get on board or jump out. So the mantra for enjoying \"Furious 7\" is \"embrace the insanity.\" You either get a kick out of it or you don't.<br/><br/>For all the crazy stuff they pulled in 6, there's an equal or one-up in 7. In the last movie you had the crew trying to take down a massive cargo plane; in this movie you have cars skydiving out of a massive cargo plane. Even when you can guess something insane is coming, you still can't believe what the filmmakers decided to do. For example, a sequence in Abu Dhabi involves the crew needing to steal something locked inside of a rare and exotic car locked in a safe room at the top of one of the city's biggest buildings. Need I say more?<br/><br/>The plot holds a little less water than 6, and to say that any \"F&amp;F\" plot holds any more or less water than another is a big difference. The film is put in motion by the events of 6, as that film's baddie, Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), is in a coma, and his special ops older brother, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) wants revenge on Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and company. Plausible, except that Deckard has an uncanny ability to track people down, show up in the right place at the right time, sneak into government facilities, perfectly time explosives and stay one step ahead of everyone — all by himself.<br/><br/>OK, easy enough to embrace that insanity. But after Dominic decides to go after Shaw, a mysterious suit and tie named Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) shows up with a small army to save the day and offer Dominic all his resources to track Shaw down if he and his crew can rescue a hacker (Nathalie Emmanuel) from a band of mercenaries led by Mose Jakande (Djimon Honsou) and find a device she invented called the God's Eye that turns all devices into the world into a personal surveillance system that can track anyone  All this to justify sending Dom, O'Conner (Paul Walker), Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Chris Bridges) to the Caucasus Mountains, Abu Dhabi and beyond. It's not longtime series writer Chris Morgan's finest work.<br/><br/>With the \"we don't care about physics\" cat out of the bag, the sky is literally the limit for what these characters can do or endure. The highs of the movie come from this potential for unbelievably imaginative sequences, but so many scenes lose suspense because we know that our heroes can fall, roll over and get crushed countless times and emerge virtually unscathed. In fact, it's kind of ridiculous that Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) actually ends up in the hospital after a \"nearly fatal\" fall early in the movie. The film's most suspenseful moment involves O'Conner, but perhaps because Walker's untimely death during production had audiences in suspense over how his character would bow out.<br/><br/>Walker's unfinished work is hard to detect. A few scenes seem out of place in an effort to use actual footage of Walker whenever possible, but if you had no idea he died during production, you'd be taken by surprise by the film's tribute ending. It really only provides us emotional catharsis for losing Paul Walker, not for the departure of Brian O'Conner from these stories. His character arc just doesn't feel complete, but undoubtedly there was only so much the filmmakers could do.<br/><br/>Horror aficionado James Wan, taking over for four-time \"F&amp;F\" director Justin Lin, brings a lot of Lin's style and adds a signature in various 90-degree camera rotations that usually follow characters in action sequences when they are not standing upright and usually in the air or falling. In a way, these shots acknowledge the unrealistic nature of the action scenes.<br/><br/>\"Furious 7\" probably takes itself the least seriously of all the movies thus far, and in that sense, it makes all the ridiculousness easier to stomach. Gibson's Pierce is really forced into the jokester role, and he manages a few laughs that he wasn't getting (from this critic) in previous films when he was prematurely being shoehorned into that stereotype. And Hobbs' return after being out of the middle act of the movie is perhaps the biggest signal that we're all supposed to just be having fun together.<br/><br/>These movies haven't quite done enough to reach a higher echelon of quality given the relaxed attitude toward good storytelling, but it's clear to anyone that they are not trying to meet any needs beyond a fun time. Hence, each movie grades out pretty similarly, with a little variation here and there. If we weren't familiar with and invested in the characters and if the budget for these movies weren't so astronomical that we could have fun watching them just because they have the money to show off, the litany of flaws would be more apparent. The high entertainment value and lack of substance pretty much offset each other, resulting in movies that are immensely watchable yet only so satisfying.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">For the absolutely most part I really enjoyed this action movie. <br/><br/>This is exactly the kind of action that I really like. Extreme action. Action that does not try to be \"realistic\" at all. Over the top action. (and I really hate people that can't accept extreme action, they be all like: \"yeah, right, that's SO unrealistic\"! Dumb people.<br/><br/>Here's what I don't like. I have to say I have a slight problem with Vin Diesel. I mean, he's alright, it's just, compared to Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham, he's just, well he kind of pales in comparison. His character is also slightly annoying. With his family-talk all the god damn time. We get it, you're into family, the only thing that matters is family, your little gang is family. Family. Family. And hose gravelly grunts he speaks in, ain't cool bruh. Sometimes you can barely make out what he is saying.<br/><br/>The movie also tries to portray him as super strong, which I don't totally buy. He's a big guy, but not that big. He looks like he thinks he's bigger than he is. Compared to the monster that is The Rock, he looks like a skinny twig for Petes sake. And he, Vin Diesel, is lifting cars and tossing people several yards, I just don't buy it.<br/><br/>Also there's some other stuff that I didn't like. There's this \"computer chip\" with some insane technology, and it seemed a little out of place. That stuff was straight up sci/fi. I hate when they mix sci/fi-stuff into action movies that are set today. The plot has some issues, but I choose not to care too much.<br/><br/>OK, got that out of the way. This movies has perfectly shot, exciting, over the top-action. Several big, long action scenes, and I pretty much loved all of them. And since this is an action movie first and foremost, I won't let the negative stuff count all that much. I was very entertained.<br/><br/>There are a couple of 'jump-out-of-a-car-in-slow-motion, at-the-last-millisecond, with-a-one-in-a-billion-chance-of-making-it'- scenes that for some reason gives me goosebumps a little. Probably because they are so over the top. I love that stuff. I think of who ever came up with something so over-the-top, and get a little impressed. Good job!<br/><br/>Good thinking getting Jason Statham into this, I so rooted for him. He is way cooler than the whole furious-team.<br/><br/>And that Nathalie Emmanuel, holy gasoline fumes is she gorgeous. And she speaks nineteen languages, including Dothraki, what a catch!<br/><br/>And of course, we all know Paul Walker is no longer with us, and you're reminded of that each time he is on screen. He gets a little montage at the end, it is very well done - really sad, man. Real damn sad.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Positive(+): Late Paul gave the film a massive opening, tribute to the powerful character of FF Series. The team really worked hard to make sure that Brian O'Conner (Paul) was there in complete film from the start to end. I was concentrating each and every step of Paul to know how the director had taken the plot to give him a final send-off. It was beautifully executed way beyond the expectation level. Good work the whole team to make it happen.<br/><br/>Negative(-): No street race, illogical at many aspects, Dwayne Johnson short screen presence had made the movie stretching into a boring plot! Jason Statham screen presence is like a magic.He will be everywhere without any clue of how he got into the place!<br/><br/>Overall - An average movie</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Watched this the other night, and I can't believe all the good reviews it is getting. I just oon't get it. I wasn't expecting a cinematic masterpiece, I knew full well going in this was going to be a car chases and explosions thrill ride sort of movie. Well, we got the car chases and explosions, but for me there was no thrill ride. I found most of the stunts visually uninspired and boring, and in spite of usually being able to turn off my brain and go with it, in this case I spent most of my time shaking my head in disbelief. This was so over the top it made old episodes of The A-Team look like a documentary. It wasn't so bad I stopped watching, but the thought did cross my mind. To all the \"it is so bad, its good\" folks, I usually like that sort of movie, but I don't think this one fits the bill, and since I enjoyed Crank 2 I think that says plenty enough. If you dig it, more power to you; if you haven't been following the franchise, go re-watch the Transporter or anything else for your car chases and explosions fix and give this one a pass. A certain amount of hoak and cheese can be fun, this was just too much for me, and I'm not the only one.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">\"Furious 7\" is an Action - Thriller movie and the seventh installment in the \"Fast &amp; Furious\" franchise, in which we watch Dom and his crew as they face a new threat from the vengeful Deckard Shaw after the incidents of the previous movie.<br/><br/>I liked this movie because it was full of action and suspense with an interesting plot despite that in some moments felt predictable. However, some of the characters and plot elements were underdeveloped, and the movie's reliance on extravagant action can feel a bit excessive at times. To sum up, I have to say that \"Furious 7\" is an entertaining and emotionally charged movie that brings the franchise to a bittersweet chapter. While it may not have the same charm as earlier entries, it still offers plenty of action and I am sure that fans of the franchise will enjoy it.</div>]\n"

            "Review Text: Perhaps Furious 7 wouldn't have that Box Office success and Popularity if the sudden death of one the main protagonists, Paul Walker AKA Brian O'Conner wouldn't have gotten in the way.But this is how it is. The heartbreaking death of Paul in that terrible car crash has made this movie so special to the heart of the long standing fans. The script can be so cliché and full of inconsistencies, this movie is the last film of Paul Walker and will always be.But what makes me to give that high note is the ending scene and the awesome tribute the rest of the fast and furious 'familia' made to Paul. They could have gotten his character to die like we have seen so many times in the past. Instead the scriptwriters rewrote the script to make a celebration of life and family.In fact, This entire saga is more about family than cars. Cars and race are just the theme and the objects attracting our attention. But the most important part of that story is the strong relationship between the characters and their interprets who are as linked in real life as they are in the movie. Each time one of their own dies they face it together as the actors are actually doing it with the loss of Paul the only REAL loss of this community. And this is what is making this beautiful.\n",

            "Review Text: The Fast and the Furious series consist of 7 movies soon to be 8, starring The Rock-Dwayne Johnson in the last 3 movies, Vin Diesel- The voice of Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy, and the late Paul Walker who has been in many action movies, along with Gal Gadot who is set to play Wonder Woman in the line of DC comics movies unfortunately Gal Gadot's character Chazelle died in Fast and Furious 6 , Michelle Rodriguez, Tyreese Gibson from Transformers, Ludicrous is a musician as well as an actor, Jordana Brewster and the antagonist is Deckard Shaw played by Jason Statham who has been in one million and one action movies. For those who have seen Fast and Furious 6 the perpetrator of those events is Owen Shaw played by Luke Evans who is in Immortals, The Hobbit the Desolation of Smaug, The Battle of the Armies, Deckard is Owen's older brother out for revenge, because Dominic Torreto's (Vin Diesel) team put Owen in the hospital. Fast and Furious 7 is packed full of action stunts that are bigger than the last movie, that take you to multiple countries all around the world, America, Abu Dhabi, Canada and multiple locations in USA. After Deckard Shaw is placed in solitary confinement in one of the most secure facilities, the team are on a beach with all their new cars lined up behind them, because of Paul Walker's death, the makers of the movie changed the ending. Dominic knows Brian O Conner (Paul Walker) doesn't belong with him anymore because he has a wife, one child and another on the way. Dominic drives off and leaves Brian behind, you see him in his car driving off into the distance when Brian now played by Paul's brother Cody Walker and some added effects, Brian says \"You thought you could leave without saying goodbye\". Dom smiles then they go their separate ways when the road forks. This ending wasn't just about Dom saying goodbye to Brian, it was about Vin saying goodbye to Paul, then the credits open with ' See you again' by Charlie Puth and Wiz Kalihifa, this song is a tribute to Paul Walker.\n",

            "Review Text: I wasn't quite sure what to expect from the seventh installment of this successful franchise but I was totally blown away by the seamless and well choreographed fight scenes and car chases. What makes this movie stand out from its predecessors is how it goes beyond the modding of Japanese street cars to engaging the viewer with a very decent storyline that pulls together all of the previous movies. I particularly liked the use of the cut-scenes from previous films that reminded viewers of the continuity of one helluva story.Of course, the other side of going to see this movie was knowing the loss of its prime star - Paul Walker - to a shocking car accident last year, and wondering how much of a role he would play in the film and how well they would work their CGI magic into his role. Needless to say, it was very well done (even though you could tell when they did use CGI of his face in a few scenes).Not trying to give anything away, but the final 5 minutes was a fitting send off for Paul. I'm sure there was a few takes for the final scene on the beach.Great film. 10/10 from me.\n",

The fight scenes were awesome,the Statham and Rock fight is one of the best in the whole series. The audience was cheering and clapping through the whole film. The movie was also hilarious due to the comedic sides of Tyrese and Ludicrous. It was interesting to see how they dealt with Paul Walker,the CGI could've been better but I loved the way they used archive footage of him.Along with the action, there is a very emotional side to this movie. There are certain scenes that are very sad and one of them,Paul actually filmed. Overall,this movie was packed with tons of action,badass one-liners,and a farewell to an amazing actor and person. Rest in Peace Paul Walker.\n",

            "Review Text: With his brother in a comatose condition in the hospital, \"Deckard Shaw\" (Jason Statham) swears vengeance on \"Dominic Toretto\" (Vin Diesel) and his team who put him there. Now, while this should certainly be a possible cause for concern to any normal person, the fact of the matter is that Deckard is a highly trained and extremely skilled professional assassin who has a terrorist organization at his disposal to help him out. Fortunately, Dominic also has some resources of his own with \"Luke Hobbs\" (Dwayne Johnson) and a shadowy government official who calls himself \"Mr. Nobody\" (Kurt Russell) who have separate agendas which coincide with Dominic's plans to kill Deckard before he can kill them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this picture definitely had the talent to be a very fine film. Unfortunately, the director (James Wan) resorted to one preposterous stunt after another which made this film look rather ridiculous in my opinion. Having said that, those who are fans of this particular franchise will probably love this movie for the simple fact that it has plenty of action and some of their favorite actors. Unfortunately, the complete lack of realism severely damaged its credibility in my eyes and I have rated it accordingly. Below average.\n",

Other than that, this movie is far away from the masterpiece a lot of people make it out to be. Especially the serious parts of the dialogue are a 101 on clichéd movie lines and the story is as surprising as the content of a bag of chips. Paul Walker was a decent actor and his death is mourned by many but an emotional 5 minute tribute at the end of the movie, that also seems tacked on in terms of the storyline, is swaying many into thinking they witnessed a new Shawshank Redemption or The Godfather movie.If you are a fan of the series you're in for a great ride and if you're into action movies in general you won't waste your time with this one. Just keep an honest perspective about this movies place in history.\n",

            "Review Text: I never understood why this franchise always made so much money and why so many people like it. Unless you like to see half naked women sponging on wet cars, cars with modified engines used in street races (and of course it's all done in a team of outlaw guys, the so-called \"family\", against other teams with people with similar desires) and to escape the police (police haters, they should inflate the scores here in IMDb), and to illicit traffic drugs and money, this type of film is not for you.I have a theory of mine because this series remains strong in the box office and each film gets better box office than the previous film of this franchise. The secret lies in the breakdown of our society. When this franchise began in 2001, our society was morally not decadent as it is today, nor so violent. In the last 16 years our society has grown worse and the values ​​of the old days began to disappear and our society and the moviegoers in general began to identify more and more ,each time, with the \"characters\" of this type of film. This is the only explanation, which I see, because every movie this franchise has billed every time the previous movie.Not anything, in this movie at the level of content or structure that is worth as a film, whether purely as fun / entertaining or for possible logical/ make you think. Not a single quality exists in this film (or in this franchise, but actually beyond the seventh film, I only saw the second film in this series (which I consider absolute crap).Anything. Plot is not interesting, shallow characters like a plate, unless you like what they do. Characters with generic lines and say cool one liner to impress the younger ones. Bureaucratic action scenes - two guys jump with a sport car at high speed between two skyscrapers. The damage is minimal, almost non-existent. Ridiculous ending. Chiché story and action scenes without suspense, tension or in a interesting way visually. At least.A waste of time, at least for me.\n",

He certainly doesn't disappoint, as every star deliver awesome action scenes. This film is different from the others because it's really good. It's not ridiculous and brainless like \"The Expendables\" series; and it's not attention deficit like the Bourne series. This combines action, brains and emotions, which is a perfect blend for blockbuster success. The action scenes are simply awesome. The scene of a car flying between buildings is superb, but by no means the best. There are so many other astounding scenes that got me holding my breath, literally. For example, Paul Walker trying to escape from a bus is a scene that made me stop breathing because it's so intense. The film is so packed with action, but it doesn't feel fragmented or attention deficit. That is what makes it stand above other action films.\"Fast And Furious 7\" constantly surprises me with jaw dropping action. Just when I thought I have seen everything, and nothing can surprise me anymore, the surprises keep on coming. I'm truly amazed by the film. I guess no one thought James Wan could make such an awe inspiring film, after establishing himself as a great horror director.\n",

But first, the Team must find and protect Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) a master Hacker/Programmer, who created God's Eye, a program that can locate anyone anywhere on the planet. Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell), the head of Black Ops, says Ramsey must be found if Dominic wants his help with Shaw.This should be watched for the stunts and CGI as both are terrific. We will see cars race down a mountain side with many trees in the way; and also see a car jump from one hi-rise building in Dubai into another hi-rise building. These stunts or CGI (who can tell anymore) will take your breath away.The pacing is very good for these stunts and CGI, but when Dominic and Shaw did hand-to-hand combat it went on forever. The scene would cut away often to the Team in cars trying to avoid the helicopter intent on taking them out with missiles, then revert back to these two who were still at it. Did I mention \"still\" at it. Yes, way too long. The real winners in here are, of course, the stunts and CGI because they were terrific. And mention must be made for the photography, editing and cinematography as they were spot on.Notables: Dwayne Johnson as Hobbs, Michelle Rodrigues as Letty, Lucacris as Tej, Jordana Brewster as Mia, Tyrese Gibson as Roman, Lucas Black as Sean, and Ronda Rousey the Champion MMA fighter. You will see Rhonda as Kara in a white dress fighting Letty. (a cat fight?) And certainly Paul Walker (Brian) who died in a car crash (he was not driving) during the filming of Furious 7. The song \"See you Again\" that played in the movie was a tribute to Paul Walker.All in all this was terrific and the action never dragged or went on for too long as scene changes helped that out a lot. This will be hard to top and there is talk of Furious 8. Ready for it? (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: Bikini and thong backsides. Language: Small stuff and not much of it.\n",

            "Title: \"Furious 7\" begs us to further embrace the insane joyride and ignore the rest\n",
            "Review Text: After \"Fast & Furious 6\" shifted the action of this mega-series into a gear not known to man — one resembling a superhero movie far more than an action franchise — those following the \"Fast & Furious\" had to either get on board or jump out. So the mantra for enjoying \"Furious 7\" is \"embrace the insanity.\" You either get a kick out of it or you don't.For all the crazy stuff they pulled in 6, there's an equal or one-up in 7. In the last movie you had the crew trying to take down a massive cargo plane; in this movie you have cars skydiving out of a massive cargo plane. Even when you can guess something insane is coming, you still can't believe what the filmmakers decided to do. For example, a sequence in Abu Dhabi involves the crew needing to steal something locked inside of a rare and exotic car locked in a safe room at the top of one of the city's biggest buildings. Need I say more?The plot holds a little less water than 6, and to say that any \"F&F\" plot holds any more or less water than another is a big difference. The film is put in motion by the events of 6, as that film's baddie, Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), is in a coma, and his special ops older brother, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) wants revenge on Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and company. Plausible, except that Deckard has an uncanny ability to track people down, show up in the right place at the right time, sneak into government facilities, perfectly time explosives and stay one step ahead of everyone — all by himself.OK, easy enough to embrace that insanity. But after Dominic decides to go after Shaw, a mysterious suit and tie named Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) shows up with a small army to save the day and offer Dominic all his resources to track Shaw down if he and his crew can rescue a hacker (Nathalie Emmanuel) from a band of mercenaries led by Mose Jakande (Djimon Honsou) and find a device she invented called the God's Eye that turns all devices into the world into a personal surveillance system that can track anyone  All this to justify sending Dom, O'Conner (Paul Walker), Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Chris Bridges) to the Caucasus Mountains, Abu Dhabi and beyond. It's not longtime series writer Chris Morgan's finest work.With the \"we don't care about physics\" cat out of the bag, the sky is literally the limit for what these characters can do or endure. The highs of the movie come from this potential for unbelievably imaginative sequences, but so many scenes lose suspense because we know that our heroes can fall, roll over and get crushed countless times and emerge virtually unscathed. In fact, it's kind of ridiculous that Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) actually ends up in the hospital after a \"nearly fatal\" fall early in the movie. The film's most suspenseful moment involves O'Conner, but perhaps because Walker's untimely death during production had audiences in suspense over how his character would bow out.Walker's unfinished work is hard to detect. A few scenes seem out of place in an effort to use actual footage of Walker whenever possible, but if you had no idea he died during production, you'd be taken by surprise by the film's tribute ending. It really only provides us emotional catharsis for losing Paul Walker, not for the departure of Brian O'Conner from these stories. His character arc just doesn't feel complete, but undoubtedly there was only so much the filmmakers could do.Horror aficionado James Wan, taking over for four-time \"F&F\" director Justin Lin, brings a lot of Lin's style and adds a signature in various 90-degree camera rotations that usually follow characters in action sequences when they are not standing upright and usually in the air or falling. In a way, these shots acknowledge the unrealistic nature of the action scenes.\"Furious 7\" probably takes itself the least seriously of all the movies thus far, and in that sense, it makes all the ridiculousness easier to stomach. Gibson's Pierce is really forced into the jokester role, and he manages a few laughs that he wasn't getting (from this critic) in previous films when he was prematurely being shoehorned into that stereotype. And Hobbs' return after being out of the middle act of the movie is perhaps the biggest signal that we're all supposed to just be having fun together.These movies haven't quite done enough to reach a higher echelon of quality given the relaxed attitude toward good storytelling, but it's clear to anyone that they are not trying to meet any needs beyond a fun time. Hence, each movie grades out pretty similarly, with a little variation here and there. If we weren't familiar with and invested in the characters and if the budget for these movies weren't so astronomical that we could have fun watching them just because they have the money to show off, the litany of flaws would be more apparent. The high entertainment value and lack of substance pretty much offset each other, resulting in movies that are immensely watchable yet only so satisfying.~Steven CThanks for reading!

            "Review Text: For the absolutely most part I really enjoyed this action movie. This is exactly the kind of action that I really like. Extreme action. Action that does not try to be \"realistic\" at all. Over the top action. (and I really hate people that can't accept extreme action, they be all like: \"yeah, right, that's SO unrealistic\"! Dumb people.Here's what I don't like. I have to say I have a slight problem with Vin Diesel. I mean, he's alright, it's just, compared to Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham, he's just, well he kind of pales in comparison. His character is also slightly annoying. With his family-talk all the god damn time. We get it, you're into family, the only thing that matters is family, your little gang is family. Family. Family. And hose gravelly grunts he speaks in, ain't cool bruh. Sometimes you can barely make out what he is saying.The movie also tries to portray him as super strong, which I don't totally buy. He's a big guy, but not that big. He looks like he thinks he's bigger than he is. Compared to the monster that is The Rock, he looks like a skinny twig for Petes sake. And he, Vin Diesel, is lifting cars and tossing people several yards, I just don't buy it.Also there's some other stuff that I didn't like. There's this \"computer chip\" with some insane technology, and it seemed a little out of place. That stuff was straight up sci/fi. I hate when they mix sci/fi-stuff into action movies that are set today. The plot has some issues, but I choose not to care too much.OK, got that out of the way. This movies has perfectly shot, exciting, over the top-action. Several big, long action scenes, and I pretty much loved all of them. And since this is an action movie first and foremost, I won't let the negative stuff count all that much. I was very entertained.There are a couple of 'jump-out-of-a-car-in-slow-motion, at-the-last-millisecond, with-a-one-in-a-billion-chance-of-making-it'- scenes that for some reason gives me goosebumps a little. Probably because they are so over the top. I love that stuff. I think of who ever came up with something so over-the-top, and get a little impressed. Good job!Good thinking getting Jason Statham into this, I so rooted for him. He is way cooler than the whole furious-team.And that Nathalie Emmanuel, holy gasoline fumes is she gorgeous. And she speaks nineteen languages, including Dothraki, what a catch!And of course, we all know Paul Walker is no longer with us, and you're reminded of that each time he is on screen. He gets a little montage at the end, it is very well done - really sad, man. Real damn sad.\n",

            "Review Text: Positive(+): Late Paul gave the film a massive opening, tribute to the powerful character of FF Series. The team really worked hard to make sure that Brian O'Conner (Paul) was there in complete film from the start to end. I was concentrating each and every step of Paul to know how the director had taken the plot to give him a final send-off. It was beautifully executed way beyond the expectation level. Good work the whole team to make it happen.Negative(-): No street race, illogical at many aspects, Dwayne Johnson short screen presence had made the movie stretching into a boring plot! Jason Statham screen presence is like a magic.He will be everywhere without any clue of how he got into the place!Overall - An average movie\n",

            "Review Text: \"Furious 7\" is an Action - Thriller movie and the seventh installment in the \"Fast & Furious\" franchise, in which we watch Dom and his crew as they face a new threat from the vengeful Deckard Shaw after the incidents of the previous movie.I liked this movie because it was full of action and suspense with an interesting plot despite that in some moments felt predictable. However, some of the characters and plot elements were underdeveloped, and the movie's reliance on extravagant action can feel a bit excessive at times. To sum up, I have to say that \"Furious 7\" is an entertaining and emotionally charged movie that brings the franchise to a bittersweet chapter. While it may not have the same charm as earlier entries, it still offers plenty of action and I am sure that fans of the franchise will enjoy it.\n",

            "[<div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">The action is fine (although it is a Transformers, Michael Bay kind of action), but that script, oh my god the script is so cheesy... This thing about cyber terrorism where everyone is a hacker, but no one uses a mouse on a computer, they all just type in front of a holographic screen with moving images from a Star Trek movie. It is just getting old. Enough with the \"lets hack into a network of satellites in 10 seconds\".<br/><br/>The characters have no real spunk behind them, they just appear, because they have to. The motives of the villain are silly and unclear, the villains henchmen are targets for shooting practice. The last couple FF movies were much much better in terms of story, still over the top action, but they had some feeling.<br/><br/>This one is just a flick for children, it's slow motion fx, big \"really big\" explosions, lots of good quality cgi, and fitting for a kids movie not a drop of blood.<br/><br/>I give it a 6, because the production and the action are great, and I like the fact that some big Hollywood names appeared in it. But it is more like a 5.7, oh did I mention that the acting sucks as well?</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Vin Diesel and the rest of the street-racing crew (with the exception of the late Paul Walker for obvious reasons) return for an eighth installment of two hours of car crashes, explosions, and over-the- top action set pieces. Like the previous entries of the popular franchise, this brisk action thriller is more about action and explosive special effects than character and plot development. As you expect from a movie dealing with non-stop car chases, this movie delivers just that. For those hoping for an action flick with a thoughtful story and firmly constructed character, this film will more than likely to be a diminishing disappointment. But for those who could care less about both aspects, this one is a whole lot of fun, if not without a few blemishes. And the new director behind this entry is F. Gary Gray who last spawned the biopic 'Straight Outta Compton'. This film follows Dominic Torretto (played by Vin Diesel) and Letty (played by Michelle Rodriguez) on their honey moon in Cuba. During their vacation, Dom is coaxed by a mysterious hot computer hacker Cipher (played by Charlize Theron) into joining her on a diabolical operation to steal an EMP weapon supplemented nuclear launch codes. With their once-loyal friend turning against them, Luke Hobbs (played by Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson) must reunite with the crew along with their former enemy Deckard Shaw (played by Jason Statham) to stop Cipher's heinous plan and solve the mystery behind Dom's betrayal.<br/><br/>This movie deliver just about everything fans would come to expect from a 'Fast and Furious' outing, from the bombastic car crashes, to the explosive street racing, to the close-up shots of scantily clad women (although the last one is a bit toned down). While the globe- trotting adventure shows little interest is constructing a powerful story or inspiring characters to feed off of, most of the cheers go to the street- racing scenes which exhibit our favorite characters engaging in frenetic, adrenaline-fueled car crashes that more often than not result in an excessive amount of property damage with cars blowing up and building torn with smithereens. Like the previous entries, this film shows no interest in obeying the laws of physics, or even engaging in authenticity. There's a brutal brawl in a prison, there are hundreds of cars dropped from buildings, there's a prolonged chase sequence on an icy field with Ryrese Gibson cruising across the ice on a car door, nearly every absurd stunt you can think makes it way on screen. As for the story, there is nothing special here aside from a few dark twists and surprises sprinkled along the way. Most of all characters we've come to know and love make their way back, and are charismatic as ever. Each of the cast take their stab at some humorous one-liners, particularly Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson and Jason Statham when are two are bantering at each other. The performances are fine, but nothing that stands out especially if you have a hard time buying Charlize Theron as a computer hacking maniac with a sinister demeanor. At the end, the characters offer a predictable message about never turning your back on family, which has become a staple in the franchise after the countless times Vin Diesel's character preaches about family. <br/><br/>The Fate of The Furious is a loud, over-the-top action festival that is solidly entertaining for those willing to turn their brain off and enjoy the extravagant action material. While this installment doesn't quite add anything new to the franchise, it serves as a firm memo that the series still has energy in it's fuel tank.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">This was painful. Action? Yes, but we're talking Physics that Sharknado would be ashamed of. Failure to understand or accept how reality works, even at a basic level. If you know the basics of cars, computers or physics, this will inflict pain to your brain.<br/><br/>No part of this movie made sense, it makes all 7 prequels seem like a real life documentary about cars. By far - Worst of the series. By going so far off the deep end, it made it too improbable for me to enjoy.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">The F&amp;F franchise has turned into The Expendables with cars, and like the last film, it gladly embraces its absurd plot and over-the-top action set pieces. It starts off with Dom on his honeymoon in Cuba where he is interrupted by a mysterious woman called 'Cipher' played by Charlize Theron. She forces him to turn against his team in order to do a series of jobs for her taking him from New York to Russia. Theron fits the role perfectly, she is menacing, seductive and manipulative and could play a perfect Bond villain.<br/><br/>Just as it threatens to be gloomy, there is some laughs to be had. Dwayne Johnson and the Stath have a good taunting scene where they shout puns at each from their prison cells. But yet again Tyrese Gibson gives us his best improv yet as he constantly pokes fun at everyone including new comer Scott Eastwood. Director F Gray (new comer to the series) has to deal with a lot of characters here. But he still manages to give them some sort of story arc and does a good job at keeping them interesting. Hobbs coaches his daughters football team in his spare time, there's a love triangle going on between Tejj, Roman and Ramsey. Then there's Letty who is trying to figure out why Dom has betrayed them and Jason Stathams villain from the last film is on a path of redemption. <br/><br/>Another thing that the franchise does so well is give us some breathtaking stunts with minimal CGI (only when needed). The film doesn't disappoint, some of the standout moments include vehicles being flipped left right and centre, cars being driven out of a buildings, an opening race sequence and wrecking ball scene to name a few. However its not perfect, there is a lot of pointless exposition dialogue to keep us up to date with what is going on. Plot device 'Gods Eye' from Furious 7 comes back which is used against the team. One scene involving Dom hiding from 'Gods Eye' so he can have a cuppa with Helen Mirren is laughable. The laws of physics are non existent of course (but its not a documentary) and it is the most implausible entry of the series yet.<br/><br/>Nitpicking aside, don't go into F8 expecting any realism or logic because there is none of it here. Just turn your brain off because its more brawn than brain. Like its predecessors, its filled with exciting, over the top, adrenaline fuelled action thrills; and there's enough harpoon guns to give Batman a run for his money. Just go into it with an open mind and you will enjoy it a lot more, its a great time at the cinema.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">What started as racing franchise has now shifted gear into a mix of old James Bond flick and shade of Marvel blockbuster. It may feel zealously exaggerated, and with high level of adrenaline and testosterone, it is indeed excessive. However, fueled by staggering amount of star power and crowd pleasing scenes, it's undoubtedly s fantastic spectacle.<br/><br/>Story doesn't veer much from the already established formula, another new threat that tries to divide and conquer, giving ample opportunities for the myriad of action heroes to fight, as well as collaborate, with each other. For the better parts, this works in creating a minimal drama even though there's bound to be slight disbelief concerning the plot, or just disregard of simple physic in general.<br/><br/>The script consists of war cries from video games and old school banters from decades ago. It's not without the humor and charm, it might even be distracting if they sound too flamboyant seeing the action is downright the stuff of superhero movie. There's the same amount of fists thrown and flying cars, and any other unbelievable shenanigans in between, in glorious slow motion and less glorious CGI.<br/><br/>It's nearly infectious in the delivery, almost looking like collection of scenes deemed to be too absurd and until now was buried in action movie vault yet they are so gleefully pompous, one can't help being dragged around by its pace. The action stars collide in battle royale style, even if one scraps all the other parts of the movie, there's an inevitable hook in the concept of The Rock, Vin Diesel and Jason Statham trading actual and verbal jabs.<br/><br/>It also helps that choreography for fights look convincingly fast and brutal enough to suit each character. The transition between grand locations, or towards another scuffle, is accompanied by good cinematography and equally vibrating soundtracks. While it may screech towards certain parts, the actors contribute in their own way, either it through surprisingly good acting or fitting humor.<br/><br/>There's enough in the production tank to keep the excitement rolling. Sure, it can be campy at times, but there's no denying that it's a high velocity spectacular action entertainment.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Look, its a Fast and the Furious film, you know what you are getting...<br/><br/>Bad writing -check<br/><br/>Clichés aplenty - check<br/><br/>Ludicrous plot - check<br/><br/>Ridiculous action set pieces - check<br/><br/>Enjoyment - you bet ya<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the previous instalments in the franchise, there's absolutely no reason why you won't like this one. It has all the trademarks of a Fast movie, and in many instances turns these up to 11 for this entry in the franchise. It's bigger, bolder, more outrageous, with plenty of action and some fantastic sequences involving the cars.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron was a nice addition to the cast, with probably the best performance in the film. The plot was very fun, following the theme of the last few instalments, which feel more like Bond/Mission Impossible style sprawling action blockbusters than mere drag racing flicks. I think this maybe had a better plot than some of the previous ones, with some good surprises and a semblance of character development thrown in there.<br/><br/>If you're a Fast &amp; Furious fan or general action movie buff, grab the popcorn and stick on Fast 8 for a fun time.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Fast &amp; Furious saga it's funny. We'll travel by fantastic places, we'll see again characters, we'll see fantastic cars, we'll listen music, we'll have new ideas about family. Movie is colorful, plenty of action, new challenges, new characters, new connections.. I enjoyed, My family enjoyed too. If you like last movies, this will not be exception.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">I've enjoyed all the fast and furious movies especially since Dwayne Johnson joined the cast.<br/><br/>This entry is enjoyable in parts.<br/><br/>To clarify the action sequences are as good and over the top as ever but the movie as a whole doesn't come together as well as previous entries.<br/><br/>Fast and furious fans will enjoy it but newcomers to the series might find the storylines a bit disjointed.<br/><br/>All in all a good entry to the series as a whole but far from being one of the best.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">I liked the previous movies of the franchise. They were decent action flicks, exactly something you go to watch in a cinema with friends. But this? This is beyond awful, it's worse than a parody. Every line is a cliché, the acting is not even mediocre, the plot line is exactly like something a 12 year old boy has come up with.<br/><br/>There's no way the 10 star reviews are NOT paid. This movie is an insult to anyone who pays to see it.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">I am so disappointed of how bad this film is. My family is a big fan of the Fast and Furious series. My dad thinks this is the worst movie ever, (besides Fast X), and my mom thinks that there is no Fast and Furious without Bryan and Mia. This is the least important movie to ever be in the franchise. I like Charlize Theron better in the later movies including The Italian Job (2003). The thing I don't like is how thy make up stories and how I like the story but it's actually very bad. This is why I have high hopes for Fast 11, (and maybe Fast 12), that the franchise will not disappoint me. The fate of Fast and Furious is at stake!</div>]\n"

            "[<div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">It's not terrible, you just have to be okay with remembering it's a senseless movie. I agree with most of the crappy ratings but I do think it's still an entertaining movie.<br/><br/>I was laughing so hard just 20 minutes in, looking at how fake and unrealistic it was, but then what else would you expect from a fast and furious movie these days. After seeing the previous two movies, nothing surprised me, not even the illogical stunts they pulled. Though they overdid themselves this time, you really need to shut your brain off to enjoy this one because they've turned a racing movie into a superhero movie now. Almost nothing makes sense in the plot or the science behind the action sequences.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">As Tej (played by Ludacris) says in the movie: \"as long as we obey the laws of physics, then we'll be fine, okay?\"<br/><br/>Yeah, that concept is right out the window in this movie. Literally. But hey, at least this 2021 movie titled \"F9\" made for some really good laughs.<br/><br/>Granted, I wasn't expecting a whole lot from director Justin Lin's movie here, as the franchise has been one steady downhill ride since after the first movie. And with each movie things become more and more outrageous and out of hand. In fact, by now the movie franchise ought to be renamed into \"The Outrageous and Ludicrous\".<br/><br/>Still, I had the opportunity to watch \"F9\", and so I did, as I hadn't already seen it. And yeah, \"F9\" was as laughable as I had anticipated it.<br/><br/>Actually, Cipher (played by Charlize Theron) actually summarized how I was feeling throughout the entire movie here, with one single line that she uttered in the movie; \"you got to be kidding me.\"<br/><br/>Visually then \"F9\" was good. Yeah, I will say that much, because the visuals definitely are top notch and help carry the movie, as basically everything else in the movie wasn't doing much for the movie.<br/><br/>And yeah, they had a very impressive cast ensemble for \"F9\", I will admit that much. What does amaze me, however, is that people on the cast list don't stop up and go \"really?\" when they read the script. But I guess, a dollar is a dollar, huh?<br/><br/>If you sit down to watch \"F9\", you have to put aside anything called laws of physics and realism. Because all those concepts are non-existing in this movie. And the abundance of things that was downright laughable and outrageous in \"F9\" is countless, but at least they provided me with a heap of laughs. Yeah, I couldn't help laugh throughout the majority of this movie, because it was just so bad.<br/><br/>\"F9\" is a watchable movie, but it is essentially just another testimony to why the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise should have stopped after \"Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift\".<br/><br/>I am rating \"F9\" a very bland and mediocre five out of ten stars. This is a movie that left no impressions on me, and it is one that will just quietly fade into oblivion, given its ludicrous over-the-top lack of respect for laws of physics, gravity and realism.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">The movies are becoming just too stupid. Soon the storyline will be 2 explosions from opposite side of the tracks who fall in love.<br/><br/>It is insulting to the audience. Actors should give their money back for making society even more dumb and primitive. Then ban the writers, director and producers from hollybank.<br/><br/>All that money and budget, probabily 125 writers they hired and they couldnt come up with a movie that would be something above the quality of a toilet cleaner. Actually all commercials,even those 5 second ones, are above this nonsense.<br/><br/>All in all, generic, insultingly dumb, unfunny and a horrible mess.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">I usually enjoy this franchise and have seen every movie multiple times. Unfortunately F9 was the most ridiculous, unbelievable, far fetched nonsense I've ever seen. It was so dumb to the point that I wasn't entertained. Talk about disappointing.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">I've heard so many jokes about the physics in F9 thinking they were just overexaggerating, but no, it's really that bad. F&amp;F is known for going crazier and crazier with each entry, but I think it's gone too far for its own good. Not one action scene entertained me; none of the scenes were creative, they were just dumb. Some may find enjoyment from how ridiculous it is, but I was just left unimpressed.<br/><br/>And the story was exactly the same as the last few F&amp;F movies. They're so similar that you can literally predict what happens if you've recently watched F8 or F7. F&amp;F has gone so far from it's roots that I've given up on the franchise. At least give one spin-off for the car guys and OG fans, maybe something similar to the first three F&amp;Fs, it'll hurt nobody, Universal.<br/><br/>This movie is just really bad. Tons of plot holes, ridiculous action scenes, and a story that disgraces what F&amp;F used to be. As a huge and longtime fan of the franchise, I have now lost faith. This film is a disgrace, and I refuse to believe that John Cena is Dominic Toretto's brother.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">That this movie is marginally more interesting than me.<br/><br/>The divorce is final next month.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Look, it's not winning any awards, but 5.2 (at the moment) is very misguiding. The action scenes are so crazy and over the top that they'll make you laugh and if you dont you need to loosen up a bit. There are a few lulls which doesn't hurt the movie but damn, some of the action scenes were so ridiculous in the best way. At no point did it feel too long and I was never bored. I did see this in a larger theatre though and I can see it not being such a spectacle if you dont have a decent home theatre setup<br/><br/>The story surprised me and had a few genuinely emotional moments, Vin was the best he's been in a while and john cena surprised me in this, I can see him getting a few big budget starring roles out of this. Tyrese is lucky they're keeping him around, the dude is straight up not funny., only times I laughed at him was how bad his one liners were...ludacris on the other hand has a few funny moments<br/><br/>If you can turn your brain off and enjoy a big budget over the top action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously then it's worth a watch.<br/><br/>The score of 5.2 is just unfair for how entertained I was.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">I'm someone who's continued enjoy these films even as they've increasingly gone off the rails. F9 is where I think I've reached my breaking point.<br/><br/>The stunts aren't even crazy anymore, they're just stupid. It's gotten impossible to care about what's happening because anyone who dies comes back to life. There are no stakes. They're also basically superheroes at this point, which they even reference in the film.<br/><br/>The magnets. My god the magnets. I don't even know what to say other than the logic and consistency of how the magnets work is flabbergasting.<br/><br/>This isn't to say everything is bad. Cena is a fun villain, even though the flashback scenes for his character are cringe. The music is still great. Lin's direction is solid. The themes still resonate, but are becoming increasingly meme-able.<br/><br/>I feel like a 6 is generous here and is mostly based on my previous enjoyment of this franchise. I hope this series can course correct or find a good ending because they're throttling towards a cliff.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Just utter garbage. To say this movie was written and made by a 12 year old is an insult to a 12 year old. This franchise needs to end now.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">This franchise was about street racing and now all of a sudden after 8 installments its about the same crew of below average actors trying to save the world from evil. If you want to see a bunch of people saving the world with their anti-physics and doent-make-any-sense sort of stunts, i'd recommend you put your 30 dollars on something like Batman or Superman because this film is wrong in so many ways that i dont even know from where to start.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">Just please stop it! That's unbelievable and we really sick of this, and we all know that you sick of this too, and you guys just make it to get earnings and a F money , but please we DON'T WANT MORE.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">I felt compelled to write this review one hour into the movie (couldn't carry on for obvious reasons)...\n",
            "We all knew the franchise was steadily worsening but this one takes the cake. I don't think you can make something utterly ridiculous even on purpose.<br/><br/>Only question I would like to ask the cast is do they actually care about F&amp;F like we the fans do/did or was it just a big lie right from the start?<br/><br/>A person with some kind of self-esteem wouldn't embarrass him/herself this way.<br/><br/>P. S. Charlize, I keep having nightmares about that haircut.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">If you've been a fan of the constant increase of ridiculous and more fantastical moments then you should like this just fine. But if you've been missing the more simple days of street racing and grounded stories then this isn't gonna win you over.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">I get it, this movie has a lot of logic loops but it never fails to entertain. I enjoyed every scene and it was a fun ride.<br/><br/>The opening scene was the standout , the first 30 minutes was epic. It's crazy and was fun to watch. The story was much better than the previous movies, a good plot but the action scenes ruined it.<br/><br/>John Cena did a really good job but he was invisible throughout the movie. Dom was just punching in the air. The action scenes were crazy and dumb but you'll enjoy it. Fast and Furious still hasn't lost it's touch, it's just getting crazier!!</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">I can drive like that, easy.<br/><br/>Dom and Jacob haven't changed a bit since 1989.<br/><br/>Everyone wears white t-shirts in combat.<br/><br/>People always run in between bullets to dodge them, don't they?<br/><br/>Did Roman just get crushed like Wile E. Coyote?<br/><br/>And his name is John Cena!<br/><br/>This is so realistic!<br/><br/>Did they just bungy jump in a car?<br/><br/>Is he a Super-hero?<br/><br/>Kids, we should try this at home.<br/><br/>This has got to be a parody, right?<br/><br/>These are just some of the thoughts, you may have, in the first 25 minutes! You'll have to watch the rest to see if cars can really drive in outer space.</div>, <div class=\"ipc-html-content-inner-div\" role=\"presentation\">How does John The Chin Cena keep getting work? Why does Michelle Rodriquez always look like she thinks she caught the smell of a fart and she's trying to figure out where it came from.? How many bullets does a good guy clip for an AK hold? It must be a few hundred.. And when going top speed does switching gears and stomping on the gas pedal really make you that much faster? And who writes this crap and how do I get a gig like this?</div>]\n"
